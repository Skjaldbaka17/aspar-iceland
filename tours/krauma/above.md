The Krauma health and relaxation tour starts at 08:00 a.m. where we will pick you up at a location we agree on. From there we will drive for about 45 minutes to a gravel parking lot close to the magnificent waterfall Glymur. There we will start hiking to the top of the waterfall. At the top we will stop for a while to enjoy the nature. Instead of doing Icelandic yoga and having lunch at the top like we do in The Glymur health and adventure tour we hike back down and drive straight to the natural geothermal baths and spa, Krauma. 

Krauma is a brand new health spa located in Deildatunguhver close to the historic place Reykholt [See map]. Reykholt was the home of Snorri Sturluson, one of Iceland's best poets. He wrote Snorra Edda(Snorri's Edda) which is a prose from the 12th century. In the prose he describes Norse mythology and it is probably our best source on that topic today. In Reykholt there's also a small pool called Snorralaug which Snorri and his friends used to bathe in in the early 12th century.
