Krauma health spa uses the hot water from the hot spring Deildatunguhver which is the most powerful hot spring in Europe. The water from this hot spring is among other things used to heat up the towns Borgarnes and Akranes which are located close to the hot spring. Another thing it is used for is to heat up the hot tubs and the saunas at Krauma spa. In November 2017 the farmers on the Reykholt area opened a health spa for the public and it's popularity is increasingly rising. 


There is no food included on this tour but we highly recommend you have lunch at the Krauma restaurant before you relax in the hot tubs. At the restaurant they serve Icelandic cuisine with fresh ingredients from local farms. If you don't want to eat at the restaurant you can also, of course, take a prepared lunch with you on the trip. In total we´ll stay at Krauma for about 2-3 hours before driving back to Reykjavík. We hope the hike and the relaxation will make you feel extraordinary good when we finish the tour. This tour will be available to you all summer(10. June - 10. August) but the maximum number of people in a single tour is 12 so don't hesitate to contact us right away so we can save a seat for you on the bus.
