The Nauthólsvík experience is a mixture of cold water, a big hot tub, a steambath and a social and fun atmosphere. This all takes place on a golden beach in Reykjavík. In total this experience takes about 2 hours. We will meet you at the University of Reykjavík at a time we agree on and from there we will walk to the beach. At the beach there are changing facilities and showers so the only thing you need to bring with you is your swimsuit and a towel.

Cold water swimming has a lot of great benefits. It has been proven that it reduces inflammation in the body. It can also serve you as a great meditation for there is not much else you can think about then the cold water you are bathing in it. It also fights against depression because doing something extreme like that will inevitably make you smile. 

For the last years cold water swimming(and basically all cold exposure of the body) has become quite popular here in Iceland. Icelanders go to the beach all year around and even when the temperature of the ocean is below 0°C(32°F). Many Icelanders say that going to the beach is their favorite time of the week.
