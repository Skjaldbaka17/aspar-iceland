One thing is to experience the cold by swimming in the ocean but another thing is experiencing the social life in the hot tub. There are many swimming pools in Reykjavík and the discussions that take place in the hot tubs can become quite interesting. The most popular topic of the discussions must be politics for people love debating about how to govern this big island in the North. So going to the hot tubs is a great way to meet new people and share different opinions. So you don't necessarily have to bathe in the ocean to get a nice experience from this trip to the beach. Just simply talking to a local while relaxing in the hot tub will give you great satisfaction. Most of us are really friendly and always up for a chat with foreigners.

Overall this is a great experience which will make you feel really good in both body and mind. It isn´t everyday you get to swim in the cold North Atlantic ocean so this is a great opportunity for you to try something new and learn more about Icelandic culture. This tour will be available to you from 15. April to 10. August but the maximum number of people in a single tour is 8 so make sure to contact us as early as possible so we can reserve your place in this experience.
