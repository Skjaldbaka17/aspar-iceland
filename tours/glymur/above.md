The Glymur health and adventure tour starts at 09:00 a.m. where we will pick you up at a location we agree on. From there we will drive for about 45 minutes to one of Iceland's most beautiful fjords, Hvalfjörður. The name Hvalfjörður can be translated to the name Whale fjord in English and it is known for it's peculiar shape because as further you go in the deeper the fjord gets. The Brits knew about Hvalfjörður's peculiar feature in WW2 and used it to keep their submarines when they arrived here with the army in 1940. In 1998 a new underwater tunnel was open for transportation in this fjord. With the tunnel it made it a lot faster to travel to the North part of the island from Reykjavík. As a result of the tunnel a far less people travel through Hvalfjörður on a daily basis which leaves it quite deserted today.
