{"W. Averell Harriman":["Americans wanted to settle all our difficulties with Russia and then go to the movies and drink Coke.","It never occurred to me that we would have as grandiose a program as the Marshall Plan, but I felt that we had to do something to save Europe from economic disaster which would encourage the Communist takeover.","Yet the whole preamble of the second authorization act for the Marshall Plan showed the direction Congress was ready to take about breaking down barriers within Europe.","Much of the aid we first gave to Russia we took away from what we promised Britain. So in a sense, Britain participated in a very real way in the recovery of Russia.","It was fear. He didn't want to see a united Germany. Stalin made it clear to me - I spoke with him many times - that they couldn't afford to let Germany build up again. They'd been invaded twice, and he wasn't willing to have it happen again.","We were talking about really getting Europe on its feet. It was our hope that there would be a breakdown of trade barriers in Europe first, and then eventually a breakdown internationally, which would help increase trade with Europe.","Roosevelt was the one who had the vision to change our policy from isolationism to world leadership. That was a terrific revolution. Our country's never been the same since.","Conferences at the top level are always courteous. Name-calling is left to the foreign ministers.","The war changed everybody's attitude. We became international almost overnight.","We became convinced that, regardless of Stalin's awful brutality and his reign of terror, he was a great war leader. Without Stalin, they never would have held.","There's a myth that Roosevelt gave Stalin Eastern Europe. I was with Roosevelt every day at Yalta.","Roosevelt was determined to stop Stalin from taking over Eastern Europe. He thought they finally had an agreement on Poland. Before Roosevelt died, he realized that Stalin had broken his agreement.","I think Stalin was afraid of Roosevelt. Whenever Roosevelt spoke, he sort of watched him with a certain awe. He was afraid of Roosevelt's influence in the world.","This was the period when I used all the influence I had to get the British to abandon their export trade, and as much as possible convert all of their manufacturing facilities to the immediate needs of the war, including civilian, as well as military requirements.","The Russians obtained a number of plants under Lend-Lease, which had been authorized by Washington, that I thought were not justified for their war effort. They wanted them for postwar use.","The Russians often took advantage of Lend-Lease.","I was quite ready to accept certain restrictions on the United States. After all, there was a great dollar shortage. It was quite clear that the more prosperous Europe became, the more business there would be in the United States.","Actually I'd had a certain amount of experience in Europe in the inter-war period, as a banker, and I was also a member of the Board of Directors of the International Chamber of Commerce.","As far as the Russians were concerned, I felt the reverse; they had adequate gold, if they wanted to buy, and they weren't dependent upon international trade. I felt they were more self-sufficient.","We both agreed that Stalin was determined to hold out against the Germans. He told us he'd never let them get to Moscow. But if he was wrong, they'd go back to the Urals and fight. They'd never surrender.","Poland, of course, was the key country. I remember Stalin telling me that the plains of Poland were the invasion route of Europe to Russia and always had been, and therefore he had to control Poland.","I think there are telegrams that may or may not be available, which indicated that I very much had in mind the need to give Europe substantial aid after the war, after Lend-Lease was over.","The biggest trade that Germany and Britain had was with each other, in the prewar period; I think I'm right in that. Two highly industrialized nations had the most trade with each other, and it wasn't tariff policies alone that made trade relations better for both of them.","How could you justify giving Holland twice the amount of money that you gave Belgium? Well, finally, I put it up to them. They said that they couldn't do it; it would destroy them. I said they had to do it. And I finally got support from Hoffman on it."],"W. Bruce Cameron":["My advice to anybody, including myself, is if you're going through a bad period, and you just can't see the world's on your shoulders and no day is a good day, you're missing the whole point of the experience. And that's something dogs know from the moment they come bounding up to you as a puppy.","When you adopt a dog, you have a lot of very good days and one very bad day.","I've read that the ancient Chinese art of feng shui can bring a sense of peace, well-being, and positive energy to a home - same as beer.","My parents live in the part of the United States that is Canada. It is so far north that Minnesota lies in the same direction as Miami. They have four distinct seasons: Winter, More Winter, Still More Winter, and That One Day Of Summer.","I think, of all the holidays we celebrate, my least favorite is Earth Day. For one thing, I never know what sort of gift is appropriate. A jar of dirt, maybe? And it's not clear to me why Earth even needs a 'day,' since a spin on its axis creates a day. That's like giving a man who owns a shoe store a gift of a pair of shoes.","My mother taught me to drive using the 'Detroit Method,' where speed limits and traffic lights are taken as cute suggestions.","I was riding my mountain bike in Colorado, and I met a dog who reminded me so much of my very first dog, in the way she interacted with me, looked at me, and wagged her tail, that I rode away convinced I'd just very possibly met the reincarnated version of my long lost friend.","When I was in grade school, my teachers decided I was just about the dumbest thing to come through the door in a long time. Whatever the lesson, whatever the subject, I would sit and listen to them with a lost, glassy-eyed expression on my face.","Without a dog, you'd never have anyone demonstrate how important it is to stop every day and smell the roses... and then lift your leg on them.","My younger sister looks to me to provide her with advice on how to do her job better - though she's too shy to ask me questions, so I have to give her my opinion on an unsolicited basis.","As to which is cuter, a puppy or a baby, I'm going to say that probably depends less on the particular puppy and more on the baby. I've seen pictures of me as an infant and consider myself lucky that nobody ever offered my parents the opportunity to trade me for a beagle.","Without a dog, you'll be without at least one creature who thinks you are the smartest, most decent and heroic human being on the planet.","You'd think skiing wouldn't be strenuous - all you have to do, after all, is start at the top and let gravity pull you to the dessert bar in the lodge. But at those elevations, you'll find about as much oxygen as you'll find kindness from your children. It's like spending six hours holding your breath.","Communicating with teenage girls is easy unless you're an adult, and then it's like having someone take a pair of pliers and, one-by-one, yank off your fingernails through your ears.","God invented love, and it is therefore perfect, and dogs are better at celebrating this perfection than we are. When in doubt as to how we should feel, we could do far worse than trying to live life like the dogs.","I've always thought that I'd make a pretty good police officer, except maybe for the danger part. I have a rare medical condition that makes it difficult for me to risk getting shot, so probably I'd have to be one of those officers who work in 'do not shoot' areas.","With a 3D printer, you could build your own car, one part at a time. When you were finished, you'd have an automobile that is extremely lightweight because it is made of plastic, which is good because you'd need to carry it because it is made of plastic.","Back during the most dramatic and challenging time in our history, when we first came together with wolves, we had no idea that it was changing everything, but we literally evolved together. Without us there would be no dogs, and vice versa.","3D printers give us what we've all been craving: another reason to talk to technical support. When you finally get the thing working, though, you'll be able to print out your grocery list as a cube! When you look up directions online, you can print the map out on a globe!","My body believes a famine is imminent and has begun stocking up on provisions. These supplies are being stored around my waistline. I've tried explaining to my stomach that this is entirely unnecessary: I've never once, not even when I was in college and more broke than the E.U., done any actual starving.","I am an independent, strong-willed, free, and unfettered individual who lets his wife decide for him what he wants to eat.","None of the kids in the neighborhood had dogs. My dad walked in that Labrador, and we started running together and rolling around together like we found each other after years apart. And then, suddenly, some of the other people in the neighborhood started getting dogs, too.","The 'Dog's Purpose' premise has gotten me so many emails and comments from people who say that their dog is so much like one they had when they were young or years before, that it seems like the truth. The idea that you would come across an old friend later in life.","I think I'm good at training dogs, but none of my dogs agree with me on that.","With my book 'How to Remodel a Man,' I was on 'Oprah,' 'Fox News,' 'The Early Show,' and 'Good Morning America.' 'Oprah' was the best - an hour long segment. TV is so short, you answer a few questions, and then it's over. It feels like a hit-and-run with a camera.","I was an arrogant man. I not only thought I could manage my life without help, I wanted it that way. I had best-selling books and a TV show and movie contracts; I felt invincible, secure in the thought that everything was my doing. And then, like all arrogant men, I came to stumble.","Your neighbors will be envious of your 3D printer - and if they're not, just print new neighbors. Design them so they'll like to bring you pies, maybe, or want to do your yard work for you.","Parenting is difficult under any circumstances, and in my father's view, to raise a morally upright and honest child, you sometimes have to lie to him.","Without a dog, I would have tassels on my throw pillows instead of little stubs of yarn that look like small worms. The pillows seem to function just fine without the tassels, so perhaps it isn't a problem.","I know it sounds strange, but I'm one of those people who goes to a coffee shop to drink coffee.","I am the sort of athlete who participates in a lot of winter sports - basketball, for example, is an activity that I'll spend many hours a week watching.","My philosophy on snow skiing is that there are less expensive ways to fall down a mountain. Yet every couple of years, I go on a ski trip for the same reason that women will have multiple children - they simply forget how much it hurts.","For me, the most indispensable tool for wrapping presents is a wife.","There are apparently three factors that lead to longevity: heredity, habits, and what your wife will let you get away with.","The first cellphone I owned was hardly a slim, high-tech device - it was more like a brick with buttons, only with worse reception. If you wanted to use your phone to give someone a message, you were better off throwing it at him and hoping you broke his car window.","Throughout the day, my phone will variously chirp, burp and growl - it's like living with a velociraptor. The last time I went to try to shut it off, the thing bit me.","In my opinion, it has never been proven that food even has calories. When I bite into a hamburger, I see pickle and ketchup and bun and meat, but if there's a calorie in there, it must be hidden.","An ice-fishing shanty is basically a tin outhouse on a frozen lake, except that in an outhouse, the hole has a purpose. In ice fishing, the hole is what you stare at for hours, hoping that at some point you'll break the monotony by falling in.","About the most exciting thing a baby can do is burp - I've spent hours of my life holding a baby on my shoulder and patting its back, trying to loosen up a burp. Burping was probably invented to give the father something positive to do, since our chests are not equipped to allow us to do much else.","The Internet has turned the world into one gigantic linked community, capable of instantly sharing vast amounts of incorrect information.","With social media, you don't just publish a book and figure you've done your part; your fans want to talk to you, have a conversation. It means, though, that you can connect with your readers like never before, so you don't have to guess what they like - you can ask.","The loneliest, most down-on-his-luck person can have a dog who adores him. The most bitter, sour person can light up with joy when he sees his dog. It is magical and, as 'The Dog Master' reveals, it is biological - we evolved together.","It's never easy to adapt a book, especially as the author, because it's as if you're chopping off appendages. It really feels painful to decide what has to go.","The story of 'A Dog's Purpose' flowed into me a set piece. The entire book was just there, as if I were connected to a streaming service, a novel wholly formed of character and plot. This has never happened to me before or since. I prayed for help and I got it. A gift.","Most of what happens in the world is far beyond a dog's comprehension, so they must turn to their faith in us to help them navigate life's treacheries. Don't we, also, have unanswerable questions about the vagaries of modern existence for which the answer is beyond human grasp, so that only our faith can guide us?","When you have a half slice of chocolate pie, it's as if you owe yourself the other half - what's known in medical circles as a 'caloric deficit.'","I've read that an average dog possesses a vocabulary of 200-300 words, which is enough for him to have his own Twitter account.","I don't think my father considered allowing a teenager to follow his dreams was necessarily good parenting, or even parenting. I think he thought I was a teenager with teenage impulses. I'm pretty sure he knew that if he just let me follow those impulses, it would wind up being very expensive and perhaps even life-endangering.","Pre-history tells us that our species used to be a hunter-gatherer society. This means that the job of raising a family was split 50-50 between the men and the women - the man's 50 percent share was to sit in the woods with a sharp stick, waiting for something to hunt to wander by, and the woman's 50 percent was to do everything else.","Even if you've gone easy on the vermouth, there are still serious downsides to alcohol consumption, including but not limited to the sense that you're a good dancer.","Going to bed can cause imaginary conversations you should have had with certain people or real conversations with your brother who is calling from a bar in a different time zone.","During the holidays, I often see my sisters, who still, even after all these years, can't always seem to agree with me. They take silly, indefensible positions, such as denying that my parents loved me more because I was the better child.","Without a dog, no one will listen to your opinions for more than a few minutes without interrupting to tell you their opinions, which you won't find nearly as interesting.","I've tried several diets over the past couple of years - not because I need to lose weight, but because my pants are trying to cut me in two.","My dog Tucker likes to walk late at night because it is a good way to keep me awake. Apparently, the one time I took him for a stroll around midnight represented, to him, a commitment similar to marriage.","Not too many people know it, but when I was in junior high, I was a pretty tough kid and was the leader of a street gang. Well, OK, it was less a street gang than an Ecology Club. We were pretty intimidating, though, and had our own meeting room until we got run out of there by a bunch of thugs from the Poetry Society.","I have never been able to pay attention to anything for more than a few minutes - the stories in my head have always been so much more entertaining. Only books could pull me out of my own imagination, and then it was only to plunge me into someone else's.","I am a newspaper columnist and a professional screenwriter, but my real love is the novel for all the room it has for characters to come alive and breathe and face their challenges.","I started writing in fourth grade and never stopped. I faked my way through high school and nearly was flushed from college - I still can't pay attention - and then had a series of day jobs. But always, continuously, I have written.","I've always been busy, but I wasn't always successful.","My favorite ski slope is the kind that winds up at the cafeteria. My children, though, usually insist that I get out and take on a few expert runs, in a game called 'Let's See if We Can Get Our Inheritance Early.'","When I was in seventh grade, I was a scrawny boy with no muscles, so I went out for wrestling. My intention was to develop secret wrestling skills so that if I were jumped by a bully, I'd shout, 'Ha!' and he'd be on the ground in a headlock."],"W. C. Fields":["Start every day off with a smile and get it over with.","A rich man is nothing but a poor man with money.","I cook with wine, sometimes I even add it to the food.","Always carry a flagon of whiskey in case of snakebite and furthermore always carry a small snake.","I am free of all prejudices. I hate everyone equally.","I once spent a year in Philadelphia, I think it was on a Sunday.","Once, during Prohibition, I was forced to live for days on nothing but food and water.","If you can't dazzle them with brilliance, baffle them with bull.","Horse sense is the thing a horse has which keeps it from betting on people.","No doubt exists that all women are crazy; it's only a question of degree.","If at first you don't succeed, try, try again. Then quit. There's no point in being a damn fool about it.","Remember, a dead fish can float downstream, but it takes a live one to swim upstream.","The best cure for insomnia is to get a lot of sleep.","The clever cat eats cheese and breathes down rat holes with baited breath.","It's morally wrong to allow a sucker to keep his money.","Never try to impress a woman, because if you do she'll expect you to keep up the standard for the rest of your life.","I drink therefore I am.","It ain't what they call you, it's what you answer to.","Women are like elephants. I like to look at 'em, but I wouldn't want to own one.","Never cry over spilt milk, because it may have been poisoned.","The world is getting to be such a dangerous place, a man is lucky to get out of it alive.","On the whole, I'd rather be in Philidelphia.","The laziest man I ever met put popcorn in his pancakes so they would turn over by themselves.","Reminds me of my safari in Africa. Somebody forgot the corkscrew and for several days we had to live on nothing but food and water.","Set up another case bartender! The best thing for a case of nerves is a case of Scotch.","When we have lost everything, including hope, life becomes a disgrace, and death a duty.","There are only two real ways to get ahead today - sell liquor or drink it.","Hell, I never vote for anybody, I always vote against.","Some weasel took the cork out of my lunch.","There comes a time in the affairs of man when he must take the bull by the tail and face the situation.","Don't worry about your heart, it will last you as long as you live.","If I had to live my life over, I'd live over a saloon.","The cost of living has gone up another dollar a quart.","Sleep - the most beautiful experience in life - except drink.","A woman drove me to drink and I didn't even have the decency to thank her.","Anyone who hates children and animals can't be all bad.","I like children - fried.","Ah, the patter of little feet around the house. There's nothing like having a midget for a butler.","Marry an outdoors woman. Then if you throw her out into the yard on a cold night, she can still survive.","I never drink water; that is the stuff that rusts pipes.","You can't trust water: Even a straight stick turns crooked in it.","I never vote for anyone. I always vote against.","Last week, I went to Philadelphia, but it was closed.","I am an expert of electricity. My father occupied the chair of applied electricity at the state prison.","I'd like to see Paris before I die... Philadelphia will do.","I was in love with a beautiful blonde once. She drove me to drink. That's the one thing I'm indebted to her for.","I like to keep a bottle of stimulant handy in case I see a snake, which I also keep handy.","It was a woman who drove me to drink, and I never had the courtesy to thank her for it.","I never worry about being driven to drink; I just worry about being driven home.","I always keep a supply of stimulant handy in case I see a snake, which I also keep handy.","Never give a sucker an even break.","Drown in a cold vat of whiskey? Death, where is thy sting?","Now don't say you can't swear off drinking; it's easy. I've done it a thousand times.","Show me a great actor and I'll show you a lousy husband. Show me a great actress, and you've seen the devil.","Children should neither be seen or heard from - ever again.","If there's a will, prosperity can't be far behind.","Some things are better than sex, and some are worse, but there's nothing exactly like it.","Here lies W. C. Fields. I would rather be living in Philadelphia.","All the men in my family were bearded, and most of the women.","Abstaining is favorable both to the head and the pocket.","I never met a kid I liked.","I never drink water. I'm afraid it will become habit-forming.","I must have a drink of breakfast.","I don't know why I ever come in here. The flies get the best of everything."],"W. Clement Stone":["Aim for the moon. If you miss, you may hit a star.","Prayer is man's greatest power!","Sales are contingent upon the attitude of the salesman - not the attitude of the prospect.","Truth will always be truth, regardless of lack of understanding, disbelief or ignorance.","Have the courage to say no. Have the courage to face the truth. Do the right thing because it is right. These are the magic keys to living your life with integrity.","Everyone who achieves success in a great venture, solves each problem as they came to it. They helped themselves. And they were helped through powers known and unknown to them at the time they set out on their voyage. They keep going regardless of the obstacles they met.","All personal achievement starts in the mind of the individual. Your personal achievement starts in your mind. The first step is to know exactly what your problem, goal or desire is.","Every great man, every successful man, no matter what the field of endeavor, has known the magic that lies in these words: every adversity has the seed of an equivalent or greater benefit.","When you discover your mission, you will feel its demand. It will fill you with enthusiasm and a burning desire to get to work on it.","Big doors swing on little hinges.","When you do the wrong thing, knowing it is wrong, you do so because you haven't developed the habit of effectively controlling or neutralizing strong inner urges that tempt you, or because you have established the wrong habit and don't know how to eliminate them effectively.","Definiteness of purpose is the starting point of all achievement.","Thinking will not overcome fear but action will.","You always do what you want to do. This is true with every act. You may say that you had to do something, or that you were forced to, but actually, whatever you do, you do by choice. Only you have the power to choose for yourself.","To every disadvantage there is a corresponding advantage.","We have a problem. 'Congratulations.' But it's a tough problem. 'Then double congratulations.'","When we direct our thoughts properly, we can control our emotions.","If you are really thankful, what do you do? You share.","Like success, failure is many things to many people. With Positive Mental Attitude, failure is a learning experience, a rung on the ladder, a plateau at which to get your thoughts in order and prepare to try again.","Be careful the environment you choose for it will shape you; be careful the friends you choose for you will become like them.","Bondage is - subjection to external influences and internal negative thoughts and attitudes.","Your most precious, valued possessions and your greatest powers are invisible and intangible. No one can take them. You, and you alone, can give them. You will receive abundance for your giving.","What contemptible scoundrel has stolen the cork to my lunch?","Try, try, try, and keep on trying is the rule that must be followed to become an expert in anything.","There's a great joy in my giving. It's thrilling. It's exhilarating. It's important to be a part of sharing. It is my love. It is my joy.","Success is achieved and maintained by those who try and keep trying.","Regardless of who you are or what you have been, you can be what you want to be.","You are a product of your environment. So choose the environment that will best develop you toward your objective. Analyze your life in terms of its environment. Are the things around you helping you toward success - or are they holding you back?","You affect your subconscious mind by verbal repetition.","To be happy, make other people happy.","There is little difference in people, but that little difference makes a big difference. The little difference is attitude. The big difference is whether it is positive or negative.","Self-suggestion makes you master of yourself.","Tell everyone what you want to do and someone will want to help you do it.","All I want to do is change the world.","No matter how carefully you plan your goals they will never be more than pipe dreams unless you pursue them with gusto.","Events tend to recur in cycles."],"W.

E. B. Du Bois":["Education must not simply teach work - it must teach Life.","I believe in Liberty for all men: the space to stretch their arms and their souls, the right to breathe and the right to vote, the freedom to choose their friends, enjoy the sunshine, and ride on the railroads, uncursed by color; thinking, dreaming, working as they will in a kingdom of beauty and love.","School houses do not teach themselves - piles of brick and mortar and machinery do not send out men. It is the trained, living human soul, cultivated and strengthened by long study and thought, that breathes the real breath of life into boys and girls and makes them human, whether they be black or white, Greek, Russian or American.","Education is the development of power and ideal.","To be a poor man is hard, but to be a poor race in a land of dollars is the very bottom of hardships.","The Negro race, like all races, is going to be saved by its exceptional men. The problem of education, then, among Negroes must first of all deal with the Talented Tenth; it is the problem of developing the Best of this race that they may guide the Mass away from the contamination and death of the Worst, in their own and other races.","An American, a Negro... two souls, two thoughts, two unreconciled strivings; two warring ideals in one dark body, whose dogged strength alone keeps it from being torn asunder.","What a world this will be when human possibilities are freed, when we discover each other, when the stranger is no longer the potential criminal and the certain inferior!","Education and work are the levers to uplift a people.","The cost of liberty is less than the price of repression.","Make yourself do unpleasant things so as to gain the upper hand of your soul.","The problem of the twentieth century is the problem of the color line.","North as well as South, the Negroes have emerged from slavery into a serfdom of poverty and restricted rights.","Before the Civil War, the Negro was certainly as efficient a workman as the raw immigrant from Ireland or Germany. But, whereas the Irishmen found economic opportunity wide and daily growing wider, the Negro found public opinion determined to 'keep him in his place.'","Strange, is it not, my brothers, how often in America those great watchwords of human energy - 'Be strong!' 'Know thyself!' 'Hitch your wagon to a star!' - how often these die away into dim whispers when we face these seething millions of black men? And yet do they not belong to them? Are they not their heritage as well as yours?","Capitalism cannot reform itself; it is doomed to self-destruction.","A little less complaint and whining, and a little more dogged work and manly striving, would do us more credit than a thousand civil rights bills.","It is a peculiar sensation, this double-consciousness, this sense of always looking at one's self through the eyes of others, of measuring one's soul by the tape of a world that looks on in amused contempt and pity.","A true and worthy ideal frees and uplifts a people; a false ideal imprisons and lowers.","I believe in God, who made of one blood all nations that on earth do dwell. I believe that all men, black and brown and white, are brothers, varying through time and opportunity, in form and gift and feature, but differing in no essential particular, and alike in soul and the possibility of infinite development.","Men we shall have only as we make manhood the object of the work of the schools - intelligence, broad sympathy, knowledge of the world that was and is, and of the relation of men to it - this is the curriculum of that Higher Education which must underlie true life.","St. Louis sprawls where mighty rivers meet - as broad as Philadelphia, but three stories high instead of two, with wider streets and dirtier atmosphere, over the dull-brown of wide, calm rivers. The city overflows into the valleys of Illinois and lies there, writhing under its grimy cloud.","From the day of its birth, the anomaly of slavery plagued a nation which asserted the equality of all men, and sought to derive powers of government from the consent of the governed. Within sound of the voices of those who said this lived more than half a million black slaves, forming nearly one-fifth of the population of a new nation.","I had a happy childhood and acceptance in the community.","No universal selfishness can bring social good to all. Communism - the effort to give all men what they need and to ask of each the best they can contribute - this is the only way of human life.","Education is that whole system of human training within and without the school house walls, which molds and develops men.","Most men today cannot conceive of a freedom that does not involve somebody's slavery.","Read some good, heavy, serious books just for discipline: Take yourself in hand and master yourself.","From the very first, it has been the educated and intelligent of the Negro people that have led and elevated the mass, and the sole obstacles that nullified and retarded their efforts were slavery and race prejudice; for what is slavery but the legalized survival of the unfit and the nullification of the work of natural internal leadership?","To stimulate wildly weak and untrained minds is to play with mighty fires.","But what of black women?... I most sincerely doubt if any other race of women could have brought its fineness up through so devilish a fire.","The problem of the twentieth century is the problem of the color line: the relation of the darker to the lighter races of men in Asia and Africa, in America and the islands of the sea.","Believe in life! Always human beings will live and progress to greater, broader, and fuller life.","Reconstruction was a vast labor movement of ignorant, muddled, and bewildered white men who had been disinherited of land and labor and fought a long battle with sheer subsistence, hanging on the edge of poverty, eating clay and chasing slaves and now lurching up to manhood.","All art is propaganda, and ever must be, despite the wailing of the purists. I stand in utter shamelessness and say that whatever art I have for writing has been used always for propaganda for gaining the right of black folk to love and enjoy. I do not care a damn for any art that is not used for propaganda.","The Talented Tenth of the Negro race must be made leaders of thought and missionaries of culture among their people.","Rule-following, legal precedence, and political consistency are not more important than right, justice and plain common-sense.","The Negro was freed and turned loose as a penniless, landless, naked, ignorant laborer. Ninety-nine per cent were field hands and servants of the lowest class.","Before and after emancipation, the Negro, in self-defense, was propelled toward the white employer. The endowments of wealthy white men have developed great institutions of learning for the Negro, but the freedom of action on the part of these same universities has been curtailed in proportion as they are indebted to white philanthropies.","The power of the ballot we need in sheer defense, else what shall save us from a second slavery?","I believe in the Prince of Peace. I believe that War is Murder. I believe that armies and navies are at bottom the tinsel and braggadocio of oppression and wrong, and I believe that the wicked conquest of weaker and darker nations by nations whiter and stronger but foreshadows the death of that strength.","A system of education is not one thing, nor does it have a single definite object, nor is it a mere matter of schools. Education is that whole system of human training within and without the school house walls, which molds and develops men.","It is African scholars themselves who will create the ultimate Encyclopaedia Africana.","All men cannot go to college, but some men must; every isolated group or nation must have its yeast, must have, for the talented few, centers of training where men are not so mystified and befuddled by the hard and necessary toil of earning a living as to have no aims higher than their bellies and no God greater than Gold.","In the Constitution of the United States, Negroes are referred to as fellows although the word 'slave' is carefully avoided before the thirteenth amendment.","The discovery of personal whiteness among the world's peoples is a very modern thing - a nineteenth and twentieth century matter, indeed. The ancient world would have laughed at such a distinction.","There was not a single Negro slave owner who did not know dozens of Negroes just as capable of learning and efficiency as the mass of poor white people around and about, and some quite as capable as the average slaveholder. They had continually, in the course of the history of slavery, recognized such men.","How hard a thing is life to the lowly, and yet how human and real!","When you have mastered numbers, you will in fact no longer be reading numbers, any more than you read words when reading books You will be reading meanings.","A classic is a book that doesn't have to be written again.","Was there ever a nation on God's fair earth civilized from the bottom upward? Never; it is, ever was, and ever will be from the top downward that culture filters. The Talented Tenth rises and pulls all that are worth the saving up to their vantage ground.","For fifteen years, I was a teacher of youth. They were years out of the fullness and bloom of my younger manhood. They were years mingled of half breathless work, of anxious self-questionings, of planning and replanning, of disillusion, or mounting wonder.","The ruling of men is the effort to direct the individual actions of many persons toward some end. This end theoretically should be the greatest good of all, but no human group has ever reached this ideal because of ignorance and selfishness.","If the leading Negro classes cannot assume and bear the uplift of their own proletariat, they are doomed for all time. It is not a case of ethics; it is a plain case of necessity. The method by which this may be done is, first, for the American Negro to achieve a new economic solidarity.","Every argument for Negro suffrage is an argument for women's suffrage.","Like Nemesis of Greek tragedy, the central problem of America after the Civil War, as before, was the black man: those four million souls whom the nation had used and degraded, and on whom the South had built an oligarchy similar to the colonial imperialism of today, erected on cheap colored labor and raising raw material for manufacture.","For the Negro, Andrew Johnson did less than nothing when once he realized that the chief beneficiary of labor and economic reform in the South would be freedmen. His inability to picture Negroes as men made him oppose efforts to give them land; oppose national efforts to educate them; and above all things, oppose their rights to vote.","As a race, the Negroes are not lazy.","I was born free.","Progress in human affairs is more often a pull than a push, surging forward of the exceptional man, and the lifting of his duller brethren slowly and painfully to his vantage ground.","If white people need colleges to furnish teachers, ministers, lawyers, and doctors, do black people need nothing of the sort?","These are the things of which men think, who live: of their own selves and the dwelling place of their fathers; of their neighbors; of work and service; of rule and reason and women and children; of Beauty and Death and War.","Negroes could be sold - actually sold as we sell cattle, with no reference to calves or bulls or recognition of family. It was a nasty business. The white South was properly ashamed of it and continually belittled and almost denied it. But it was a stark and bitter fact.","For most people, it is enough for the world to know that they aspire. The world does not ask what their aspirations are, trusting that those aspirations are for the best and greatest things. But with regard to the Negroes in America, there is a feeling that their aspirations in some way are not consistent with the great ideals.","I am a Bolshevik.","After the Egyptian and Indian, the Greek and Roman, the Teuton and Mongolian, the Negro is a sort of seventh son, born with a veil, and gifted with second-sight in this American world, - a world which yields him no self-consciousness, but only lets him see himself through the revelation of the other world.","One ever feels his twoness - an American, a Negro; two souls, two thoughts, two unreconciled strivings; two warring ideals in one dark body, whose dogged strength alone keeps it from being torn asunder.","The use of slave women as day workers naturally broke up or made impossible the normal Negro home, and this and the slave code led to a development of which the South was really ashamed and which it often denied, and yet perfectly evident: the raising of slaves in the Border slave states for systematic sale on the commercialized cotton plantations.","If there is anybody in this land who thoroughly believes that the meek shall inherit the earth they have not often let their presence be known.","I am an earnest advocate of manual training and trade teaching for black boys, and for white boys, too.","My great-grandfather fought with the Colonial Army in New England in the American Revolution.","My autobiography is a digressive illustration and exemplification of what race has meant in the world in the 19th and 20th centuries.","The slavery of Negroes in the South was not usually a deliberately cruel and oppressive system. It did not mean systematic starvation or murder.","In the South, there was absence of any leadership corresponding in breadth and courage to that of Abraham Lincoln.","It can be safely asserted that since early Colonial times, the North has had a distinct race problem. Every one of these States had slaves, and at the beginning of Washington's Administration, there were 40,000 black slaves and 17,000 black freemen in this section."],"W. E. B. Griffin":["My own military background is wholly un-distinguished. I was a sergeant.","Argentina has the best bird shooting in the world.","An author's characters do what he wants them to do."],"W. Earl Brown":["I grew up hunting and fishing in Land Between the Lakes. I have so many great memories of camping with my mom over at Redd Hollow.","All stories boil down to good vs. evil, and that's what the archetypal American Western was.","I remember vividly, as a kid, my mother had 'Jesus Was a Capricorn' and used to listen to it over and over and over.","I'm very wary of fawning too much over heroes. There's an old adage that heroes are best kept at arm's length, and in a few instances in my life, that's been true.","Sometimes, I have played something that psychologically sticks with me, that's opposite of where I am. I guess I have a lot of anger in me.","I told my wife once, 'I feel like I'm getting paid to sit at the feet of Aristotle.' Some people are like, 'You're comparing David Milch to Aristotle,' and yeah, I am, but I'm not Plato.","I grew up in Murray, Kentucky. My wife is from there, also.","I consider William Gay one of the great writers that no one has ever heard of.","While my megalomania knows no bounds, directing is one thing I have never really done. I directed a couple of plays. That was the extent of it.","I try to physically and mentally immerse myself in whatever it is I am doing. That is good for me as an artist.","I am a music freak. My tastes run the gamut from Willie Nelson to Metallica to Miles Davis.","My daughter doesn't love me because I'm on TV, she loves me because I'm her dad.","My wife married me when the odds were that I'd be a house-painting bouncer for the rest of my days. She has stuck by me through that with nothing but love and support.","John Belushi made me want to be an actor.","I grew up playing cowboy, and I still have all my Johnny West toys from when I was a kid. I have my actual toys from when I was five.","My best friend growing up was a truck driver, and it was big in truck stops. He'd have his 'Deadwood' DVDs, and they'd watch them in the lounge.","When 'Deadwood' ended, I thought, 'I'll never have this again, ever.'","David Milch is one of the smartest human beings I've ever met. I'm relatively bright and relatively well-read. I'm not in a league with that guy.","David Milch, twice I got lectures from him about the theory of writing. I told my wife one night when I got home, 'I feel like I'm being paid to sit at the feet of Aristotle.'","Stories have a way of telling themselves.","I was a bouncer when I was in DePaul in Chicago at the theater school. I threw drunks out of bars - unless I had a play running that weekend. But I only had two actual fights. Some were like out of old Westerns.","My dad traveled a lot, so I only usually saw him on weekends, growing up. His favorite actors in the world were Clint Eastwood and Burt Reynolds. If Clint or Burt had a movie out, we would go to the movies. He didn't like movies, generally, unless Clint or Burt were in them.","Any characters that make me think, 'I don't know if I can do this,' are the ones I most want to do. I don't want to do the same thing over and over.","I once did a film in which I was being chased by wolves. I had a scene where the Alpha of the pack leapt on the hood of my car and stared me down through the windshield. I will never forget staring into those eyes; this wasn't a dog - not even a tough, bad-ass dog - no, this was a wolf.","My friend, Zachary Throne, was playing a gig with Lemmy and the Upsetters. Knowing of our shared love of Motorhead, Zach called me up and invited me to the rehearsal.","If you loved music, Lemmy was your friend, regardless of who you were or where you came from.","While I do not want to live my life like Lemmy chose to live his, I can't help but admire the strength and determination it took for Lem to do it all on his own terms and remain true to himself.","I like playing the bad guys. It's a way of exercising and exorcising my own personal demons.","If the writing is good, I'm there. If it's something I've never done before, I'm up for that, too.","I wanted to make a comfortable living and raise a family, and that's what I did."],"W. Edwards Deming":["Quality is everyone's responsibility.","A bad system will beat a good person every time.","Quality is pride of workmanship.","It is not enough to do your best; you must know what to do, and then do your best.","If you don't understand how to run an efficient operation, new machinery will just give you new problems of operation and maintenance. The sure way to increase productivity is to better administrate man and machine.","Research shows that the climate of an organization influences an individual's contribution far more than the individual himself.","We are here to make another world.","If you can't describe what you are doing as a process, you don't know what you're doing.","I am forever learning and changing.","It is not necessary to change. Survival is not mandatory.","No one knows the cost of a defective product - don't tell me you do. You know the cost of replacing it, but not the cost of a dissatisfied customer.","Rational behavior requires theory. Reactive behavior requires only reflex action.","Learning is not compulsory... neither is survival.","The big problems are where people don't realise they have one in the first place.","If you do not know how to ask the right question, you discover nothing.","You can not define being exactly on time.","People with targets and jobs dependent upon meeting them will probably meet the targets - even if they have to destroy the enterprise to do it.","Customer expectations? Nonsense. No customer ever asked for the electric light, the pneumatic tire, the VCR, or the CD. All customer expectations are only what you and your competitor have led him to expect. He knows nothing else.","Declining productivity and quality means your unit production costs stay high but you don't have as much to sell. Your workers don't want to be paid less, so to maintain profits, you increase your prices. That's inflation.","Export anything to a friendly country except American management.","Eliminate numerical quotas, including Management by Objectives.","Profit in business comes from repeat customers, customers that boast about your project or service, and that bring friends with them.","The prevailing - and foolish - attitude is that a good manager can be a good manager anywhere, with no special knowledge of the production process he's managing. A man with a financial background may know nothing about manufacturing shoes or cars, but he's put in charge anyway.","Innovation comes from the producer - not from the customer.","The prevailing system of management has crushed fun out of the workplace.","The average American worker has fifty interruptions a day, of which seventy percent have nothing to do with work.","When a system is stable, telling the worker about mistakes is only tampering.","Hold everybody accountable? Ridiculous!","All anyone asks for is a chance to work with pride.","The result of long-term relationships is better and better quality, and lower and lower costs.","Lack of knowledge... that is the problem.","What should be the aim of management? What is their job? Quality is the responsibility of the top people. Its origin is in the boardroom. They are the ones who decide.","My mother was my biggest role model. She taught me to hate waste. We never wasted anything.","In 1945, the world was in a shambles. American companies had no competition. So nobody really thought much about quality. Why should they? The world bought everything America produced. It was a prescription for disaster.","You should not ask questions without knowledge.","Whenever there is fear, you will get wrong figures.","I predicted in 1950 that in five years, manufacturers the world over would be screaming for protection. It took only four years.","The emphasis should be on why we do a job.","In Japan, a company worker's position is secure. He is retrained for another job if his present job is eliminated by productivity improvement.","People don't like to make mistakes.","'Quality' means what will sell and do a customer some good - at least try to.","Any manager can do well in an expanding market.","American management thinks that they can just copy from Japan. But they don't know what to copy."],"W. Eugene Smith":["Never have I found the limits of the photographic potential. Every horizon, upon being reached, reveals another beckoning in the distance. Always, I am on the threshold.","Photography is a small voice, at best, but sometimes one photograph, or a group of them, can lure our sense of awareness.","Passion is in all great searches and is necessary to all creative endeavors.","I've never made any picture, good or bad, without paying for it in emotional turmoil.","The world just does not fit conveniently into the format of a 35mm camera."],"W. G. Sebald":["Going home is not necessarily a wonderful experience. It always comes with a sense of loss and makes you so conscious of the inexorable passage of time.","I don't want to talk about my trials and tribulations. Once you reveal even part of what your real problems might be in life, they come back in a deformed way.","I am what I am.","Places seem to me to have some kind of memory, in that they activate memory in those who look at them.","Occasionally I write a small piece or the odd lecture in English, and I teach in English, but my fiction is always written in German.","If you're based in two places, on a bad day you see only the disadvantages everywhere. On a bad day, returning to Germany brings back all kinds of spectres from the past.","A subject which at first glance seems quite removed from the undeclared concern of the book can encapsulate that concern.","People's ability to forget what they do not want to know, to overlook what is before their eyes, was seldom put to the test better than in Germany at that time.","The moral backbone of literature is about that whole question of memory. To my mind it seems clear that those who have no memory have the much greater chance to lead happy lives.","You could grow up in Germany in the postwar years without ever meeting a Jewish person. There were small communities in Frankfurt or Berlin, but in a provincial town in south Germany, Jewish people didn't exist.","To my mind, it seems clear that those who have no memory have the much greater chance to lead happy lives. But it is something you cannot possibly escape: your psychological make-up is such that you are inclined to look back over your shoulder.","In school I was in the dark room all the time, and I've always collected stray photographs; there's a great deal of memory in them.","My parents came from working-class, small-peasant, farm-labourer backgrounds and had made the grade during the fascist years; my father came out of the army as a captain.","Unlike Conrad or Nabokov, I didn't have circumstances which would have coerced me out of my native tongue altogether.","In the history of postwar German writing, for the first 15 or 20 years, people avoided mentioning political persecution - the incarceration and systematic extermination of whole peoples and groups in society. Then, from 1965, this became a preoccupation of writers - not always in an acceptable form.","It would be presumptuous to say writing a book would be a sufficient gesture, but if people were more preoccupied with the past, maybe the events that overwhelm us would be fewer.","England is not very easy to get in and out of.","I came from anonymity, and I will continue to write as a private pursuit.","There is a beauty in nature and culture that we no longer have access to. Those things you can't forget, you embroider... The further you tell, the further you travel from truth, which means, of course, that literature is a lie.","I don't think one can write from a compromised moral position.","My texts are written like palimpsests. They are written over and over again, until I feel that a kind of metaphysical meaning can be read through the writing.","It is a sore point, because you do have advantages if you have access to more than one language. You also have problems, because on bad days you don't trust yourself, either in your first or your second language, and so you feel like a complete halfwit.","I was brought up largely by my grandfather because my father only returned from a prisoner-of-war camp in 1947 and worked in the nearest small town, so I hardly ever saw him.","Until I was 16 or 17, I had heard practically nothing about the history that preceded 1945. Only when we were 17 were we confronted with a documentary film of the opening of the Belsen camp.","Where I grew up, in a remote village at the back of a valley, the old still thought the dead needed attending to - a notion so universal, it's enscribed in all religions. If you didn't, they might exact revenge upon the living.","I always read the translator's draft all the way through - a very laborious business.","Comparing oneself with one's fellow writers is a bad idea. I would not review a fellow writer unless I had something terribly positive to say.","I've always felt that the traditional novel doesn't give you enough information about the narrator, and I think it's important to know the point of view from which these tales are told: the moral makeup of the teller.","I've always been interested in photographs, collecting them not systematically but randomly. They get lost, then turn up again.","It must be extremely uncomfortable to live with a writer - all that preoccupation and brooding.","Although I hold a German passport, I feel very much alienated when I'm there.","Up until the 17th century, Germany was far more advanced, but then everything devastated by the 30 Years War began to fall apart... The culture is not innocent.","My father was not really a presence for me. He was away; he was in the German army.","I cannot get over the fact that I was born in 1944. I want to find out as much as I can about that year.","When I was a boy, I'd hide under the kitchen table and wind string around the chairs. I have a sense now that I am pulling on those threads. The more I pull, the more it comes unraveled.","The longer I carry on, the more difficult writing seems to get.","The writing I do makes great demands on translators.","Mine is a European imagination, shaped largely by my very promiscuous reading in German, French, English and, with greater difficulty, Italian."],"W. H. Auden":["We are all here on earth to help others; what on earth the others are here for I don't know.","If equal affection cannot be, let the more loving be me.","Thousands have lived without love, not one without water.","Death is the sound of distant thunder at a picnic.","We all have these places where shy humiliations gambol on sunny afternoons.","Among those whom I like or admire, I can find no common denominator, but among those whom I love, I can: all of them make me laugh.","History is, strictly speaking, the study of questions; the study of answers belongs to anthropology and sociology.","In times of joy, all of us wished we possessed a tail we could wag.","The ear tends to be lazy, craves the familiar and is shocked by the unexpected; the eye, on the other hand, tends to be impatient, craves the novel and is bored by repetition.","My face looks like a wedding-cake left out in the rain.","Every autobiography is concerned with two characters, a Don Quixote, the Ego, and a Sancho Panza, the Self.","It takes little talent to see what lies under one's nose, a good deal to know in what direction to point that organ.","Art is born of humiliation.","Some writers confuse authenticity, which they ought always to aim at, with originality, which they should never bother about.","Geniuses are the luckiest of mortals because what they must do is the same as what they most want to do.","A real book is not one that we read, but one that reads us.","'Healing,' Papa would tell me, 'is not a science, but the intuitive art of wooing nature.'","What the mass media offers is not popular art, but entertainment which is intended to be consumed like food, forgotten, and replaced by a new dish.","A poet is, before anything else, a person who is passionately in love with language.","Evil is unspectacular and always human, and shares our bed and eats at our own table.","All sins tend to be addictive, and the terminal point of addiction is damnation.","Almost all of our relationships begin and most of them continue as forms of mutual exploitation, a mental or physical barter, to be terminated when one or both parties run out of goods.","I'll love you, dear, I'll love you till China and Africa meet and the river jumps over the mountain and the salmon sing in the street.","All that we are not stares back at what we are.","A poet can write about a man slaying a dragon, but not about a man pushing a button that releases a bomb.","Now is the age of anxiety.","You owe it to all of us all get on with what you're good at.","A poet is a professional maker of verbal objects.","Music can be made anywhere, is invisible and does not smell.","Learn from your dreams what you lack.","A tremendous number of people in America work very hard at something that bores them. Even a rich man thinks he has to go down to the office everyday. Not because he likes it but because he can't think of anything else to do.","Before people complain of the obscurity of modern poetry, they should first examine their consciences and ask themselves with how many people and on how many occasions they have genuinely and profoundly shared some experience with another.","All works of art are commissioned in the sense that no artist can create one by a simple act of will but must wait until what he believes to be a good idea for a work comes to him.","Between friends differences in taste or opinion are irritating in direct proportion to their triviality.","Good can imagine Evil; but Evil cannot imagine Good.","If time were the wicked sheriff in a horse opera, I'd pay for riding lessons and take his gun away.","A professor is someone who talks in someone else's sleep.","Hemingway is terribly limited. His technique is good for short stories, for people who meet once in a bar very late at night, but do not enter into relations. But not for the novel.","Choice of attention - to pay attention to this and ignore that - is to the inner life what choice of action is to the outer. In both cases, a man is responsible for his choice and must accept the consequences, whatever they may be.","The class distinctions proper to a democratic society are not those of rank or money, still less, as is apt to happen when these are abandoned, of race, but of age.","When I find myself in the company of scientists, I feel like a shabby curate who has strayed by mistake into a room full of dukes.","Some books are undeservedly forgotten; none are undeservedly remembered.","To save your world you asked this man to die; would this man, could he see you now, ask why?","It's a sad fact about our culture that a poet can earn much more money writing or talking about his art than he can by practicing it.","God bless the USA, so large, so friendly, and so rich.","May it not be that, just as we have to have faith in Him, God has to have faith in us and, considering the history of the human race so far, may it not be that 'faith' is even more difficult for Him than it is for us?","Every American poet feels that the whole responsibility for contemporary poetry has fallen upon his shoulders, that he is a literary aristocracy of one.","Murder is unique in that it abolishes the party it injures, so that society has to take the place of the victim and on his behalf demand atonement or grant forgiveness; it is the one crime in which society has a direct interest.","For who can bear to feel himself forgotten?","No good opera plot can be sensible, for people do not sing when they are feeling sensible.","A verbal art like poetry is reflective; it stops to think. Music is immediate, it goes on to become.","Perhaps there is only one cardinal sin: impatience. Because of impatience we were driven out of Paradise, because of impatience we cannot return.","In relation to a writer, most readers believe in the Double Standard: they may be unfaithful to him as often as they like, but he must never, never be unfaithful to them.","Music is the best means we have of digesting time.","No hero is mortal till he dies.","Murder is commoner among cooks than among members of any other profession.","In a world of prayer, we are all equal in the sense that each of us is a unique person, with a unique perspective on the world, a member of a class of one.","Art is our chief means of breaking bread with the dead.","One cannot walk through an assembly factory and not feel that one is in Hell.","The countenances of children, like those of animals, are masks, not faces, for they have not yet developed a significant profile of their own.","The words of a dead man are modified in the guts of the living.","No human being is innocent, but there is a class of innocent human actions called Games.","Like everything which is not the involuntary result of fleeting emotion but the creation of time and will, any marriage, happy or unhappy, is infinitely more interesting than any romance, however passionate.","The center that I cannot find is known to my unconscious mind.","It's frightening how easy it is to commit murder in America. Just a drink too much. I can see myself doing it. In England, one feels all the social restraints holding one back. But here, anything can happen.","When I am in the company of scientists, I feel like a shabby curate who has strayed by mistake into a drawing room full of dukes.","You know there are no secrets in America. It's quite different in England, where people think of a secret as a shared relation between two people.","I don't get acting jobs because of my looks.","Health is the state about which medicine has nothing to say.","Fame often makes a writer vain, but seldom makes him proud.","Sob, heavy world Sob as you spin, Mantled in mist Remote from the happy.","It is a sad fact about our culture that a poet can earn much more money writing or talking about his art than he can by practicing it.","Of all possible subjects, travel is the most difficult for an artist, as it is the easiest for a journalist.","No poet or novelist wishes he were the only one who ever lived, but most of them wish they were the only one alive, and quite a number fondly believe their wish has been granted."],"W. H. Davies":["It was the rainbow gave thee birth, and left thee all her lovely hues.","Being in this fine mood, I spoke to a little boy, whom I saw playing alone in the road, asking him what he was going to be when he grew up. Of course I expected to hear him say a sailor, a soldier, a hunter, or something else that seems heroic to childhood, and I was very much surprised when he answered innocently, 'A man.'","What is this life if, full of care, we have no time to stand and stare?","There is quite a large clan of Scotties among American beggars. He is a good beggar for the simple reason that he is a good talker. Almost every Scotch beggar I met in the States of America was inclined to be talkative, and yet they all managed to conceal their private affairs.","The more help a person has in his garden, the less it belongs to him.","I had now been in the United States of America something like five years, working here and there as the inclination seized me, which, I must confess, was not often. I was certainly getting some enjoyment out of life, but now and then the waste of time appalled me, for I still have a conviction that I was born to a different life.","I like to give pennies to children, but unfortunately, a man cannot do these things if he lives in a small village or town where his face is known and seen every day. For children take advantage, as I know to my cost, and would gather round him like hens around a farmer when he scatters grain.","It was a proof of Welsh good nature: so long as I had a friend that knew and could introduce me, the whole Welsh people would do anything to entertain, and would even neglect their business to do so. But as a stranger in Wales, it is difficult to break through their suspicion and mistrust.","As long as I love Beauty I am young.","Cockneys make good beggars. They are held in high esteem by the fraternity in America. Their resource, originality and invention, and a never-faltering tongue enable them to often attain their ends where others fail, and they succeed where the natives starve.","My own wandering blood comes from my seafaring grandfather, who, after he had left the sea and settled on shore, still governed his house by a ship's rules.","I don't suppose there is a more daring or more impudent rascal on earth than a good American beggar. It is always his boast that he has begged an ex-president, or the present one, and he claims to have received benefits from a number of well-known millionaires, actors, and prize-fighters.","How the snow falls in the north! Flake on flake falling incessantly, until the small dingles are almost on a level with the uplands. It throws itself on the leaves of autumn, and holds them down in security from the strongest winds.","But cats to me are strange, so strange I cannot sleep if one is near.","Teetotallers lack the sympathy and generosity of men that drink.","Mother's father and brothers all took great interest in pugilism, and they knew the game well from much practice of their own. They were never so much delighted as when I visited them with a black eye or a bloody nose, at which time they would be at the trouble to give cunning points as to how to meet an opponent according to his weight and height.","It has always been a wonder to me where my conversational power has gone: at the present time, I cannot impress the most ordinary men.","It is not altogether shyness that now makes me unsuccessful in company. Sometimes it is a state of mind that is three parts meditation, that will not free the thoughts until their attendant trains are prepared to follow them.","My impression of Americans from the beginning is of the best, and I have never since had cause to alter my mind. They are a kind, sympathetic race of people and naturally proud of their country.","Summer boarders often left clothes behind, and of what use were they to the landladies, for no rag-and-bone man ever called at their houses. The truth of the matter was that in less than a week I was well dressed from head to foot, all of these things being voluntary offerings, when in quest of eatables.","We were determined to be in the fashion, and to visit the various delightful watering places on Long Island Sound. Of course, it would be necessary to combine business with pleasure and pursue our calling as beggars.","I like to see a good scientific bout by men who know the use of their hands but would rather walk twenty miles than see animals in strife.","However careful a tramp may be to avoid places where there is abundant work, he cannot always succeed.","I dislike society because conversation exhausts my brain more than silent thought - again, I cannot hold my water long enough for a prolonged conversation.","I had made up my mind to find a woman to share my life: one who would leave London altogether and go with me into the green country and be satisfied."],"W. H. Murray":["Whatever you can do, or dream you can, begin it. Boldness has genius, power, and magic in it.","All sorts of things occur to help one that would never otherwise have occurred.","The more the soul knows, the more she loves, and loving much, she tastes much."],"W. Kamau Bell":["The Olympics are great, but they only truly mean something when the moments that come out of them are bigger than the individual sports.","I have always had a strange relationship to Portland, Oregon. It's a great city. The people who live there love it openly and loudly, and it regularly appears on the lists of best American cities. But something has always felt weird to me about Portland. And not in the way Portlanders mean 'weird' in their slogan 'Keep Portland weird.'","I can't imagine what it must be like to be one of the indigenous people of the United States of America. I can't imagine watching the news every day - as people debate whose country this is and who should be in charge of it and how to make it great again - and hardly ever see your people brought into the discussion.","We can't throw the worst part of racism into the dustbin of history.","Knowing that more people associate Chicago with street violence than generosity is difficult for me because, despite all my proclamations of being from the Bay Area, I have spent much of my life in Chicago. So I have a deep love and a pretty good understanding of the city.","I only halfway paid attention in high school Spanish class, and it may be too late now to catch up, no matter how many levels of Rosetta Stone I order.","The Right doesn't usually threaten to leave the country. When the Right feels threatened, it just declares it is going to invent a time machine to take the country back so that America can be 'great again.'","Throughout my career and my life, I talk a lot about racism in this country, and if you're going to talk about it, then you're going to eventually come to the chapter about the Klan.","As much as some people like to put down 'political correctness,' if it wasn't for political correctness, I wouldn't be free right now.","You don't get smarter by not learning stuff.","People always want narratives to be clean and easy.","In the deep corner of my heart, I'm a Chicagoan, but it's been covered over by 20 years of living in the Bay Area.","I feel like, as a black guy, I can't not believe in God... I'd wake up in the morning, 'I'm black, and there's no God? I'm going back to sleep.'","I grew up in a household where we talked about race all the time, and that's sort of in me. So if I become the Anthony Bourdain of race and culture, then great!","Comedy can be very deep sometimes.","I am a comedian: that means I laugh at things other people don't laugh at and also annoys my wife sometimes.","Women don't get the benefits of America the way men do.","My dad and stepmom live in Mobile, Ala., and spend their vacation time an hour's drive away in Orange Beach, Ala. This means that, throughout my life, I have regularly vacationed there as well.","Whenever I tell people in Berkeley, Calif., where I live, that I'm headed to the beach in Alabama, they are shocked. Most people outside of the Gulf Coast have no idea that Alabama has beaches - even though if you look at a map of Alabama, there is a part of it that looks as if it should belong to Florida.","People live in their part of the Union, and if they don't travel a lot, then there is a tendency to believe that the other parts of America couldn't possibly be as American as their part. You can see it in the way people in the South scrunch up their faces when they hear words like 'New York,' 'Chicago,' and 'challah.'","The alt-right is the Tea Party's younger, cooler, meaner brother. Like if the movie 'Back to The Future' was just about Biff.","People born in Puerto Rico are U.S. citizens - except for the teeny, tiny, mind-boggling fact that if you live in Puerto Rico, you are not allowed to cast a vote in the election for president. That tiny fact starts to get bigger when you realize that electing our own leaders is the whole reason that we have a country in the first place.","The citizens of Puerto Rico pay taxes with no representation every day, because Puerto Rico is not a state. And the rules only became more confusing the more I looked into them during my time there.","Growing up in the Midwest, Boston, and Alabama, I didn't know any Puerto Ricans... at least, I didn't know if I knew any Puerto Ricans. The only Puerto Rican that I had ever even heard of was Juan Epstein, one of the students from the classic 1970s sitcom 'Welcome Back, Kotter.'","Chicago is a world-class city filled with amazing people with big ideas.","When we filmed the premiere episode of 'United Shades of America,' it was like we were turning over a rock in the woods. The KKK was not part of the national conversation. They were really just a punchline for comedians when you needed to let the audience know something was really, really, really racist.","America, the self-described greatest nation on Earth, has the highest incarceration rate on the planet.","When Arnold Schwarzenegger was pronouncing it 'Cal-LEE-fornia,' he was right - he just didn't realize he was accidentally speaking Spanish.","There's no religion in this country that is more misunderstood, mis-categorized, and misidentified than Islam.","Donald Trump giving a speech on Islam is like me giving a speech titled, 'The Best Haircuts to Have If You Really Want to Succeed in Corporate America.' I could do it. But I'd mostly be making it up as I went along.","The downside to defining everything Chinese as different than American is that all things Chinese then become exotic.","Since its inception, the government has broken and coerced treaties with hundreds of Native American tribes. And this is even worse when you realize that the native peoples of this land are negotiating for land that is, by all common sense and elementary school logic, their land.","Atheism is like the highest level of white privilege. It's like having a black belt in white privilege.","I am proud to be black man.","I'm happy that I know how to speak 'Southern.' I spent a lot of time in Alabama throughout my life. I even lived there for part of junior high and high school, so I learned the true beauty and mastery of the Southern dialect. 'Y'all' is one of the greatest and most useful words ever invented.","We all need to make sure that we fully understand our country.","The alt-right is working hard to cloak its desire to create chaos in the streets as free speech. They say they want to air their views, but it's about provoking violent reactions. We all can easily see that this is not about free speech.","Puerto Rico is complicated. The people are complicated. The history is complicated. The story of the United States' relationship to Puerto Rico is complicated.","One thing that people outside Chicago need to understand is that the city is not just one thing. It is one city, but it is huge and sprawling. And historically, it has been one of America's most segregated cities.","The size of the city and the nature of how independent the neighborhoods are means that not only do people who live outside Chicago not know what is going on there, Chicagoans often don't know what is going on there.","Even if the KKK isn't the outsized presence it once was in this country, many of its principles and ideas are alive and well.","The day-to-day discomforts of prison life, combined with the big-picture realities of mass incarceration, do not add up to a party.","Most prisons in this country are in the middle of nowhere, which makes it much easier for us all to throw those people away. Out of sight, out of mind.","Shouldn't one of the goals of prison be getting as many of the inmates as possible back out into the world to be responsible citizens? Aren't we just wasting generations of human potential by keeping over two million people behind bars?","As a black person in this country, I am always frustrated by the lack of attention my people's issues get. But at least the news and politicians are talking about not talking about our issues. Native issues are basically ignored.","I'm just another non-native whose mom told him we were part-Cherokee.","America loses so much of what defines it if you subtract the Chinese influence. I know this because I spent 12 years living in one of America's most popular tourist destinations: San Francisco. And it would not be one of America's top tourist destinations without Chinatown.","If we go the direction that many of the leaders of this country want and close the borders and discourage new immigrants, then we are ruining the possibility of new ideas and new experiences.","For some people, the definition of who is and who isn't an American defies logic, historical accuracy, common sense, decency, good manners, the milk of human kindness, enjoyment in the good things in life, and love of good food.","I've been to the Bahamas. It's a beautiful country with truly excellent people. When I took a cruise that docked for a couple hours in Nassau, it mostly reminded me of a giant version of my grandmother's neighborhood in Mobile, Alabama... but with better accents.","When we let cops talk about themselves as a separate community, then we are letting cops wall themselves off from the rest of us. We don't generally do that with any other jobs. We don't talk about the barista community or the Wal-Mart greeter community.","Cops should not be separate from the black community or any community. Their salaries are paid for by the communities they police. They should be working for the communities they police. But as we saw in Ferguson, Missouri, they are not always doing that.","In communities of color, such as Ferguson, it often feels like the police are protecting the white community from us instead of protecting our communities from the criminal element.","I want President Obama to want to take your guns away. I don't trust you with your guns. I don't trust you to fire them safely. I don't trust you to store them safely. I don't trust your kids not to find them. I don't trust you not to get them stolen.","The history of Oregon is partially the history of a state that legislated not wanting black people around.","Capitalism doesn't care about sentimentality.","To be off the grid is to be disconnected from most of America's infrastructure without having to cross any border.","In most major cities, you can find stores for urban homesteaders. They sell everything you need so that you won't need anything. Sort of a 'Take This Civilization and Shove It' starter kit.","Usually, the news out of Florida makes me feel like being black in Florida can be a terminal condition.","No state income tax, no snow, lots of golf courses, and ready-made gated communities make Florida an irresistible place for seniors - the ones who have the income level - to retire.","At worst, spring break in Daytona Beach feels feral - like everybody is trying to re-create scenes from the movie 'The Hangover.'","We really suffer from a hot-take disease, wanting to be the first one who has the hottest take.","If we're constantly giving every one of our allies the woke test instead of inviting them to be more woke, we're doomed. You can be the most woke person of all time and be alone.","The big thing I learned from Chris Rock was not to be a victim of show business. Don't let show business push you around.","I was born in the Bay Area because my dad was a semi-professional photographer and poet who was really into John Coltrane. He's had many lives. My dad's a capitalist to his bone, but he's also a human to his bone.","I've turned the annoying questions that white people ask into a career, so I understand that's where I live.","If you say, 'I don't care if Muhammad Ali was a Muslim or not; he was just great,' what you're really saying is, 'I don't care about Muhammad Ali.' Same with Prince being black.","I have an upfront, sort of in-the-trenches knowledge of white people's trying to avoid their whiteness and replace it with something else. When I met my wife, we went through the whole race-slash-ethnicity conversation, and she told me she was Italian. Later on, I find out she's a quarter Italian, at best.","I never wanted to be in the late-night talk show wars, and I think somehow with 'Totally Biased,' I got caught up in all that. Suddenly, there are articles about how we finally have a black voice in late-night.","There were definitely a few ways I could have gone after 'Totally Biased' ended. One of those was getting a job at Starbucks.","There's a lot of power in laughter.","Over the years, I'd hear Jon Stewart disavow being a journalist and say, 'No, I'm a comedian.' I'd be like, 'Stop pretending. You know you're a journalist.'","Most people have the ability to turn their empathy engine back on, but there's such a seductive burn to not being empathetic.","I keep trying to write the crowd-pleasing slavery joke and the crowd-pleasing reparations joke, but any time you mention slavery or reparations in any detail, it seems to bum lots of people out. That's a challenge I keep putting in front of myself.","I want to write the reparations joke that makes people go, 'Yay! I'm so happy!' It's easy to go onstage and just make fun of all the 'isms' instead, but we can't all be Jeff Dunham. Although that pays very well... it pays way better to be Jeff Dunham than it ever paid to be George Carlin or Lenny Bruce.","When I was starting out, I was just bringing a garbage bag of jokes onstage, pulling them out like, 'What about this? No? Alright.' I was just trying to be funny about anything.","The jokes I was always attracted to, and that I would tell for the longest, were jokes where I cared about the subject. Whenever I wrote a joke where I didn't care, even if it was really funny, the third time I told it, it would lose steam.","When 'Totally Biased' was canceled, I thought my career was over - but apparently it wasn't.","I've always been a fan of these travel shows and documentary series.","That's how to make a stand-up comedian: You take a person who is uncomfortable and try to squirrel their way out of it through humor.","I just want to make TV that I want to see.","As a black man, I actually had naturally sort of comedic curiosity about the Klan.","If I have any talent, I think I have an ability to listen to people and also just meet them on their level.","This is a country that was founded on racism. It was built on racism. It still continues to thrive through wealth disparity, and housing disparity is all built on the backs of racism.","My agenda... is to learn about people.","As a comedian, you see all parts of the country because you play there.","No comedian grows up thinking, 'I hope one day to have a show on CNN.'","I like living in Berkeley, but I know Berkeley's not the world.","People in Hollywood can condescend to the way a lot of other people are living.","When things aren't going well for black people, they blame the government. When things aren't going well for white people, they can't blame the government because the government is supposed to be for them. So they blame black people.","We should always be having a conversation about if we could make this country more inclusive and what we can do to do that.","The country should be more inclusive, not less inclusive, and over an infinite timeline, it becomes more inclusive. It doesn't always happen at once.","You can be as exclusive as you want to in your house, but once you walk outside your house, you have to realize that it's not your world anymore: it's all of our world.","When I stand up in front of groups of people who agree with me, I know I have to really step my game up because I can't just sort of meet them where they're at; I have to take them somewhere else. They want you to challenge them and have good ideas.","If I say 'political comedian,' then people think you're talking about you, the Senate and Congress, and what's going on in Washington D.C. If I say 'comedian,' people automatically assume that you're a comedian who talks about how his wife won't listen to him and that dummy down at the mechanic who wouldn't fix his car.","If you're on TV regularly, doing a thing regularly, whether you're Anthony Anderson on 'Black-ish' or Don Lemon, an hour a night, you have to turn into, 'What's the delivery system through which I can deliver information?' I don't mean they are being fake or that they are doing something that's disingenuous.","What has happened is we've allowed the people who run policies in this country to sort of make us pick Left and the Right as if those are the only two choices.","Stand-up comedians know how to walk into a room, even if you're not performing, just read the temperature of a room, and can easily sort of tell what's going on or what people are sort of feeling in the room, and it allows you to sort of approach people."],"W. L. George":["Cats know how to obtain food without labor, shelter without confinement, and love without penalties.","Men have been found to deny woman intellect; they have credited her with instinct, with intuition, with a capacity to correlate cause and effect much as a dog connects its collar with a walk.","Wars teach us not to love our enemies, but to hate our allies.","Vanity is as old as the mammoth.","Given that we glimpse what distinguishes man from the beast, is there anything that distinguishes woman from man?","She is still less civilized than man, largely because she has not been educated."],"W. Mark Felt":["I have to do this my way.","I'm the guy they used to call Deep Throat.","The Bureau doesn't have any secret files.","I haven't leaked anything to anybody. They are wrong!","I never leaked information to Woodward and Bernstein or anyone else!"],"W. P. Kinsella":["Find something that thrills you, and when you finish reading it for enjoyment, read it again line by line, paragraph by paragraph to see what you liked about it.","The crack of the bat, the sound of baseballs thumping into gloves, the infield chatter are like birdsong to the baseball starved.","I have no interest in non-fiction. I don't read it and don't watch it and don't write it, other than a little journalistic column.","If I have a choice between looking something up and making it up, I'll make it up every time.","Baseball is meant to be a contemplative game. They play music to draw young people to the game. If young people can't come to the game without music, then they should stay home.","I don't believe in the afterlife.","I knew how to read box scores and who the baseball heroes were before I had ever seen or even heard much of a game.","Read, read, read, read and then read some more.","Most people write a lot of autobiography, but when I came to write autobiography I discovered that nothing interesting had ever happened to me. So I had to take the situation and invent stories to go with it.","I can still put down some pretty nasty stuff on paper, which is what I enjoy doing.","Most writers are unhappy with film adaptations of their work, and rightly so. 'Field of Dreams,' however, caught the spirit and essence of 'Shoeless Joe' while making the necessary changes to make the work more visual."],"W. Richard Stevens":["After graduating in 1973 I went into the programming field.","I drove across country in my yellow 1970 VW bug (which I drove until 1986) to Los Angeles, having had enough cold weather in 5 years in Ann Arbor, and found a job within a few days.","In 1975 I decided that there was no future in flying (airline jobs were impossible to get, and who wants a job where you are judged only by seniority?) and headed off to grad school."],"W. S. Merwin":["Poetry is like making a joke. If you get one word wrong at the end of a joke, you've lost the whole thing.","We are asleep with compasses in our hands.","Now all my teachers are dead except silence."],"W. Somerset Maugham":["We are not the same persons this year as last; nor are those we love. It is a happy chance if we, changing, continue to love a changed person.","Beauty is an ecstasy; it is as simple as hunger. There is really nothing to be said about it. It is like the perfume of a rose: you can smell it and that is all.","It's a funny thing about life; if you refuse to accept anything but the best, you very often get it.","We learn resignation not by our own suffering, but by the suffering of others.","Tradition is a guide and not a jailer.","There are two good things in life - freedom of thought and freedom of action.","The love that lasts longest is the love that is never returned.","Old age has its pleasures, which, though different, are not less than the pleasures of youth.","An unfortunate thing about this world is that the good habits are much easier to give up than the bad ones.","Only a mediocre person is always at his best.","The essence of the beautiful is unity in variety.","When you choose your friends, don't be short-changed by choosing personality over character.","If a nation values anything more than freedom, it will lose its freedom, and the irony of it is that if it is comfort or money that it values more, it will lose that too.","There is no explanation for evil. It must be looked upon as a necessary part of the order of the universe. To ignore it is childish, to bewail it senseless.","Death is a very dull, dreary affair, and my advice to you is to have nothing whatsoever to do with it.","Every production of an artist should be the expression of an adventure of his soul.","What makes old age hard to bear is not the failing of one's faculties, mental and physical, but the burden of one's memories.","If you don't change your beliefs, your life will be like this forever. Is that good news?","Old age is ready to undertake tasks that youth shirked because they would take too long.","Considering how foolishly people act and how pleasantly they prattle, perhaps it would be better for the world if they talked more and did less.","In Hollywood, the women are all peaches. It makes one long for an apple occasionally.","In the country the darkness of night is friendly and familiar, but in a city, with its blaze of lights, it is unnatural, hostile and menacing. It is like a monstrous vulture that hovers, biding its time.","Perfection is a trifle dull. It is not the least of life's ironies that this, which we all aim at, is better not quite achieved.","It is not true that suffering ennobles the character; happiness does that sometimes, but suffering for the most part, makes men petty and vindictive.","The most useful thing about a principle is that it can always be sacrificed to expediency.","The crown of literature is poetry.","You can do anything in this world if you are prepared to take the consequences.","It was such a lovely day I thought it a pity to get up.","We have long passed the Victorian Era when asterisks were followed after a certain interval by a baby.","If you want to eat well in England, eat three breakfasts.","Let us develop the resources of our land, call forth its powers, build up its institutions, promote all its great interests, and see whether we also, in our day and generation, may not perform something worthy to be remembered.","At a dinner party one should eat wisely but not too well, and talk well but not too wisely.","Tolerance is another word for indifference.","Imagination grows by exercise, and contrary to common belief, is more powerful in the mature than in the young.","Money is the string with which a sardonic destiny directs the motions of its puppets.","Excess on occasion is exhilarating. It prevents moderation from acquiring the deadening effect of a habit.","Money is like a sixth sense without which you cannot make a complete use of the other five.","I can imagine no more comfortable frame of mind for the conduct of life than a humorous resignation.","There are three rules for writing a novel. Unfortunately, no one knows what they are.","The common idea that success spoils people by making them vain, egotistic and self-complacent is erroneous; on the contrary it makes them, for the most part, humble, tolerant and kind.","Love is only a dirty trick played on us to achieve continuation of the species.","The artist produces for the liberation of his soul. It is his nature to create as it is the nature of water to run down the hill.","It's very hard to be a gentleman and a writer.","Any nation that thinks more of its ease and comfort than its freedom will soon lose its freedom; and the ironical thing about it is that it will lose its ease and comfort too.","You are not angry with people when you laugh at them. Humor teaches tolerance.","Impropriety is the soul of wit.","A man marries to have a home, but also because he doesn't want to be bothered with sex and all that sort of thing.","The ability to quote is a serviceable substitute for wit.","Have common sense and stick to the point.","Perfection has one grave defect: it is apt to be dull.","Few misfortunes can befall a boy which bring worse consequence than to have a really affectionate mother.","Marriage is a very good thing, but I think it's a mistake to make a habit out of it.","It is an illusion that youth is happy, an illusion of those who have lost it.","You know what the critics are. If you tell the truth they only say you're cynical and it does an author no good to get a reputation for cynicism.","The world is quickly bored by the recital of misfortune, and willing avoids the sight of distress.","Like all weak men he laid an exaggerated stress on not changing one's mind.","The trouble with young writers is that they are all in their sixties.","The writer is more concerned to know than to judge.","The world in general doesn't know what to make of originality; it is startled out of its comfortable habits of thought, and its first reaction is one of anger.","My own belief is that there is hardly anyone whose sexual life, if it were broadcast, would not fill the world at large with surprise and horror.","Writing is the supreme solace.","I'll give you my opinion of the human race in a nutshell... their heart's in the right place, but their head is a thoroughly inefficient organ.","When you are young you take the kindness people show you as your right.","It is salutary to train oneself to be no more affected by censure than by praise.","The writer of prose can only step aside when the poet passes.","It is unsafe to take your reader for more of a fool than he is.","The great American novel has not only already been written, it has already been rejected.","I would sooner read a time-table or a catalogue than nothing at all. They are much more entertaining than half the novels that are written.","It is not wealth one asks for, but just enough to preserve one's dignity, to work unhampered, to be generous, frank and independent.","When I read a book I seem to read it with my eyes only, but now and then I come across a passage, perhaps only a phrase, which has a meaning for me, and it becomes part of me.","It wasn't until late in life that I discovered how easy it is to say, 'I don't know.'","People ask for criticism, but they only want praise.","It's no good trying to keep up old friendships. It's painful for both sides. The fact is, one grows out of people, and the only thing is to face it.","We know our friends by their defects rather than by their merits.","I made up my mind long ago that life was too short to do anything for myself that I could pay others to do for me.","Anyone can tell the truth, but only very few of us can make epigrams.","It seems that the creative faculty and the critical faculty cannot exist together in their highest perfection.","Death doesn't affect the living because it has not happened yet. Death doesn't concern the dead because they have ceased to exist.","Men have an extraordinarily erroneous opinion of their position in nature; and the error is ineradicable.","Sentimentality is the only sentiment that rubs you the wrong way.","What has influenced my life more than any other single thing has been my stammer. Had I not stammered I would probably... have gone to Cambridge as my brothers did, perhaps have become a don and every now and then published a dreary book about French literature.","Habits in writing as in life are only useful if they are broken as soon as they cease to be advantageous.","Things were easier for the old novelists who saw people all of a piece. Speaking generally, their heroes were good through and through, their villains wholly bad.","It is well known that Beauty does not look with a good grace on the timid advances of Humour.","No egoism is so insufferable as that of the Christian with regard to his soul."],"Wadada Leo Smith":["I don't set out to win awards. I don't think any musician does, but when you receive an award, it's an affirmation: it means that people appreciate what you do. Every award I have received is a confirmation of something I have done, and that motivates me to push a little harder.","Seeing the bigger picture opens your eyes to what is the truth.","I'm an optimist. I have always been, and I will continue to be. So I believe there's always a possibility of transforming or changing or doing something different.","Jazz infers a style, but creative music has a wider field and wider specification about it. We know it from people like Scott Joplin and on through Bessie Smith.","When you live in the South, you're constantly part of the civil rights movement.","All art is political. Yes. Even the stuff that sounds like bubble-gum songs. I think all art is, by nature, intended to motivate society for change, and the only reason change doesn't happen is because within the target population, courage is lacking.","I wanted to identify that the black experience is American experience.","When Barack Obama was elected, it immediately brought out all the differences in society.","I've got that Beethoven energy, that Stravinsky energy. And it's all a gift from the Creator.","There's nothing unnatural in creation.","My solo playing utilizes the deployment of suggestive psychic rhythms. I'll state these throughout a given piece and play thematic improvisations on top of that. I like to suggest that rhythmic movement without always playing it. I like to create openings that I can step into.","When I first started, I worked with my father, Alex 'Little Bill' Wallace; he was a guitarist like B.B. King. I was around 13 when I started, and I learned a lot by looking and listening. I learned how to be a bandleader from watching that band work.","I think all art is, by nature, intended to motivate society for change, and the only reason change doesn't happen is because within the target population, courage is lacking.","The artist is the consciousness of society... but musicians' role is very special.","Everything and anything is valuable.","From now back to the past, we can observe clearly that none of us is free.","We have these old fashioned ideas. For instance, here in America, we talk about democracy - but we don't have a democracy. There are elements of a democracy.","I always felt of myself as a composer, performer, improviser. I've never called myself a jazz man. I make art.","I don't set out to win awards. I don't think any musician does, but when you receive an award, it's an affirmation: it means that people appreciate what you do.","I started composing when I was around 13, and back then, people used to say that I needed to be a composer or a performer, but I can't be good at both of them. I could never understand why anyone would say that. Jellyroll did both, Bessie Smith did both, and so did I.","I write all the time. I always have. I can pick up my horn to warm up, and an idea will pop into my head, and I'll write it down and file it away for another time.","The only thing that makes change possible is the idea of developing some kind of institution, because the institutions will survive individuals.","I have been in dialogue with my family about what can actually be done. We've come up with this philosophy that in a truly multicultural society, the only way to have liberty and justice for everybody is to have multiple parties. And by multiple parties, I mean 50 parties, not one or two."],"Wadah Khanfar":["The Arab spring confirmed that peaceful change is possible and so reinforced the vision of political Islam. The impact of this went beyond the Brotherhood to include the Salafist tendency in Tunisia, Egypt, Yemen and Libya that had questioned the democratic path.","When an international news organization covers a story in Somalia, Yemen, Sudan or wherever, they will fly a crew to go there, spend a few days, interact with some officials and analysts, most of the time English-speaking elite, and file the story and go home.","I started as an engineer. I migrated to philosophy and international politics. And I did my studies about African - Africa democracy and democratization in Africa, taking Kenya as a model. And then, while I was doing so in 1996 in South Africa, Al Jazeera was established. So they requested me to be an analyst on African affairs.","At Al Jazeera, we are getting our local Somalis, Yemenis and Sudanese, local correspondents from within the society, who understand much better than the people who come from overseas. We will get a much better insight.","What I like to call 'journalism of depth' is the media that regards the collective conscience of the masses to be its point of departure. It is the media that believes, as a matter of principle, in the potential capabilities of the people and respects their choices.","Because I was once a reporter, I've always felt a sense of estrangement inside the newsroom. The field is alive and interactive, while the newsroom is quiet and stereotypical.","I started, actually, as an analyst on African affairs, mainly on Al Jazeera. I remember the first few series were about Saudi students, and the negotiations between the government and the Sudanese rebels in the south. And then, slowly, I was speaking about Congo, Democratic Republic of Congo, Zimbabwe, Mozambique and a few other places.","I think 2001 was the year Al Jazeera started to play an international role, in a way. Because in 2001, we were the only TV station located inside Kabul, and every image out of the war in Afghanistan, the beginning of the war in Afghanistan, came through Al Jazeera screen.","For me, Islam is a moral reference point, a source of inspiration to work collectively with people, to love people and to help them, to concentrate on universal values of mercy, co-operation and tolerance.","Some people call it the 'Al Jazeera spirit' - courage, re-thinking authority, giving a voice to the voiceless. We have never been favored by the authority. The human being is the center of our editorial policy. We are not a TV station that rushes after stars, big names, press conferences, hand-shake journalism.","The international media concentrates on the famous, the big names. Al Jazeera goes to the margins, investigates stories that are still developing and in the future become very big. Why did the Arabic world love Al Jazeera? Everybody felt he was represented in the newsroom and on the screen. That kind of belonging is ours.","Al Jazeera is not a tool of revolution. We do not create revolutions. However, when something of that magnitude happens, we are at the center of the coverage.","The stability and security of authoritarian regimes cannot create but terrorism and violence and destruction. Let us accept the choice of the people. Let us not pick and choose who we would like to rule their future.","When the Islamic revolution began in 1979 under the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini, it aroused considerable admiration in the Arab street. It presented a model of organised popular action that deposed one of the region's most tyrannical regimes. The people of the region discerned in this revolution new hope for freedom and change.","The best people to provide valuable information about any society are the children of that society who belong to its culture and are part of its collective conscience.","At times, some journalists see nothing in the people apart from an opportunity to make material gain. They see them as consumers to whom we sell commodities at huge profits that keep our bank accounts growing.","We have Al Jazeera Arabic news, Al Jazeera English news, of course; we have three sports channels, and we have Al Jazeera Mubasher, which is a live channel that broadcasts live press conferences and symposiums and meetings. And, of course, we have Al Jazeera commentary in Arabic.","Al Jazeera is known in the Arab world as the voice of freedom of expression.","We are not a TV station that only concentrate on those who are always under light. We are not a TV station for celebrities and for grand politicians and superstars. We are a TV station for the ordinary person. The normal people, ordinary people in the Arab world sees Al Jazeera as their voice.","I discovered that, in order to write a magnificent piece, you should shoot the images because once you are filming, you are writing the script in your mind.","The Arab spring that began in 2010 was driven by the educated youth who were connected to the outside world. They had visions of liberal politics derived from social networks. They used innovative means to spread awareness and to network among activists.","The Arab spring was not as radical as the French or Iranian revolutions. It did not pull out the deeply entrenched roots of the state. Instead, it was satisfied to replace the top of the pyramid with newly elected, but inexperienced, leaders.","News is the backbone of our network; the main commodity and the main successes of Al Jazeera came out of our involvement in covering the news in the Middle East.","Al Jazeera is the opinion of other opinion, independent. Al Jazeera is diverse, reflection of the collective mind of the nations and cultures and civilizations that we report from and we report to, bridge of dialogue. This is what Al Jazeera is all about. Al Jazeera is a mission.","Al Jazeera is a representation of, you know, diversity in the Arab world. In our newsroom, we have every single nationality, we have every single, you know, ideology, we have every single background. However, when it comes to the screen, we have one code of ethics and one code of conduct.","There is a very deep conviction in the heart of the people who work in al-Jazeera that if it changes its editorial line, it will very quickly lose its audience. Al-Jazeera has its own style; it has more than 3,500 employees, and I don't think anyone will have the attitude of changing it because they will lose.","If Al Jazeera America becomes just another mainstream TV station, it is definitely not going to succeed.","I do believe, given the heritage of Al Jazeera itself in Arabic and in English, I think Al Jazeera will succeed in introducing another perspective on the news that the American market is in need for.","Al Jazeera should understand the societies, should understand the culture of the civilisation, should understand the dynamics of the societies, should be part of this understanding; and on the other level, Al Jazeera should concentrate on the margin rather than the centre. It means that Al Jazeera should be close to the public.","In 1996, Al Jazeera was the first TV station in the Arab world to allow Israelis to appear on the screen and express their views and address the Arab world. Before that, Arab broadcasters did not allow what was perceived as the enemy to appear on the screen."],"Wade Boggs":["Anyone can be a father, but it takes someone special to be a dad, and that's why I call you dad, because you are so special to me. You taught me the game and you taught me how to play it right.","A positive attitude causes a chain reaction of positive thoughts, events and outcomes. It is a catalyst and it sparks extraordinary results.","Our lives are not determined by what happens to us but how we react to what happens, not by what life brings us but the attitude we bring to life.","In life, so many things are taken for granted, but one thing I can honestly say is that I took every day, enjoyed the game of putting on that uniform and playing the great game of baseball.","I played the game one way. I gave it everything I had. It doesn't take any ability to hustle.","Humbled by the fact that never in a million years would I ever thought that I would be on the same stage with all these great Hall of Famers and enshrined to the National Baseball Hall of Fame.","This journey started about 42 years ago in a little town of Brunswick, Georgia.","Looking back on those days and little leaguer, the Hall of Fame is not even a blinking star, but through baseball travels and moving up the ladder, that star begins to flicker.","My God... What are the headlines going to be like on Monday if the Yankees don't make the playoffs?","I have a message for the young kids. Life is about obstacles, endeavors in life are not to be overlooked.","I didn't get over 1300 walks without knowing the strike zone.","One guy that I wish was here right now, Ted Williams, helped me so much, our long talks, not about hitting but about fishing, one of Ted's passions, and I wish he was here today to share this with me because I owe so much to Ted Williams.","The owner of the New York Yankees, Mr. George Steinbrenner who I had the greatest respect for, I want to thank him for giving me the opportunity to win that special ring in 1996.","Then there's Johnny Pesky, hit me countless number of ground balls and improved my fielding so much."],"Wade Davis":["All cultures through all time have constantly been engaged in a dance with new possibilities for life. Change is the one constant in human history.","Heroes are never perfect, but they're brave, they're authentic, they're courageous, determined, discreet, and they've got grit.","What could be more lonely than to be enveloped in silence, to be the last of your people to speak your native tongue, to have no way to pass on the wisdom of the elders, to anticipate the promise of the children. This tragic fate is indeed the plight of someone somewhere roughly every two weeks.","You know, once something freezes, it's solid. That's the key to the arctic - they didn't fear the cold, they made use of it.","It's haunting to realize that half of the languages of the world are teetering on the brink of extinction.","Change is no threat to culture.","On paper I would be a rather bold individual in our culture."],"Wael Ghonim":["I'm married to an American. I work for a company that is, you know, its headquarters in the U.S.","As an Egyptian, I was always frustrated, just like many young Egyptians, of the situation in the country. And to a large extent, we didn't know what could we do. And looking at Khaled's photo after his death; basically I just felt that we are all Khaled Said.","The last thing I would do to this country is to even put my personal interests about the country's interest. I have never done that in my life, and I will never do it because I, you know, I was brought up as a very patriotic Egyptian, and this is not just going to happen.","The transition from dictatorship to democracy is always very difficult, and if you read a history of any country that went through this, it wasn't easy. And, you know, you don't end dictatorship one day and next day you have fully fledged democracy.","I am not a hero, O.K.? I am not a hero. I am a very ordinary person."],"Wagner Moura":["I try to be a good father, and my kids are the most important thing in my life.","I'm 100 percent convinced that Pablo Escobar was a human being. And he was a very interesting one. For sure, he was a very, very, very mean and awful human being in many senses, but he wasn't an alien. He was a person. He had friends; people laughed at his jokes. And he was a very contradictory person as well.","Colombians are sick of 'Narcos' stories because Colombia is a country that has changed so much. It's a country that's completely different from the country that we see in 'Narcos.' They reconstructed themselves in 25 years, which is amazing.","I think that addiction is a very, very important thing that has to be treated, but has to be treated as a health problem and not as a police problem.","Forced labor affects the most vulnerable and least protected people, perpetuating a vicious cycle of poverty and dependency. Women, low-skilled migrant workers, children, indigenous peoples, and other groups suffering discrimination on different grounds are disproportionately affected.","After reading and studying and getting in touch with the amount of information that I had while I was researching to play Pablo, it just reinforced the idea that I had that the war on drugs is a big flop.","One of the things that I like about 'Narcos' is that not only Pablo but with all the characters - this is not a black and white show. This is not a regular American cop show where two cool cops go to save a country from a bad guy. All the characters are very complex.","'Narcos' was a very strong experience, not only artistically and politically, but as a human being.","The heroes of 'Narcos' are the Colombian people who fought and decided to do something about the horrible narco-terrorism that took place in their country back in the '80s.","If you want to see the real Pablo Escobar, go see a documentary.","We'll always be fascinated by people who live above the law.","Pablo wanted to be loved and accepted. He wanted to destroy the elite he despised so much, but he also wanted to be the president of Colombia.","I always thought those World War II films with German people speaking English with German accents was weird.","I believe that modern slavery is the most outrageous assault on the rights of an individual. It is something that touches me deeply because I grew up in rural Brazil and could see first-hand how poverty forced people to work in harsh, exploitative conditions.","One of the things I like best about Netflix is that they make projects like 'Beasts of No Nation.' It's a film about a reality in an African country where kids were being used to be soldiers in a war. And it made so much sense to me as a citizen of the world.","Doing 'Narcos' is a very, very important part of my life. I dedicated so much of my life to it.","The emotions you see when you watch 'Narcos,' they're pretty much my emotions and the way I would react if I were there. It's not something you create; all of us have everything inside ourselves.","One of the most effective tools in Brazil's efforts to eradicate slavery is a register compiled by the government that lists individuals and businesses found using slave labor. Those on the 'dirty list,' as the register is known, are fined and remain on it for a minimum of two years during which they cannot access public funds.","I was once supposed to play the wind in a commercial - yes, the wind. I didn't get it.","The thing about Pablo is that he wasn't happy with what he had - just being the sixth richest man in the world. He wanted to be loved. He wanted to be accepted. He wanted to be President of Colombia; he wanted his kids to go to the same school as the Colombian elite. But he wouldn't be accepted by the elite.","This left-wing kind of speech, the Robin Hood thing that Pablo had, of course he was a criminal and a mean person, but it wasn't a false. He wasn't false. I don't know what kind of president he would be, maybe a very bad one, but I am sure he would do things for poor people - popular things that wouldn't solve their lives but would help them.","I grew up watching American films, listening to American music, and it's a big contribution to the rest of the world. I mean, American jazz, for me, is the best thing culturally that America has produced."],"Waite Hoyt":["I went in, and there, in the front room, a converted bedroom, sat the first radio I had ever seen. The equipment was so bulky that it took up one entire wall of the bedroom. The set, which could send or receive signals, was tuned to KDKA in Pittsburgh, and I remember being completely flabbergasted at the thought of sounds coming from that box.","I was so naive in radio technique that I knew nothing about timing. I would write pages on Honus Wagner and then get only half through by the time the show ended. I eventually learned, but there was nobody there to school me.","You never really know baseball until you put on a pair of cleats and get out and play it; and if you play for five years, you still don't really know what it's about.","When I joined WKRC, they were very concerned over my ability to ad lib or speak extemporaneously, which was an unknown factor up until that point.","The first time that I ever saw Babe Ruth was in the Boston Red Sox clubhouse.","Joe Dugan, who was my roommate on the Yankees, was an honorary pallbearer, too. He was standing next to me as they were carrying the Babe down the steps of St. Pat's Cathedral here in New York. There must have been 5,000 people standing around on the sides of the street, and it was tremendous.","There is nothing like Ruth ever existed in this game of baseball. I remember we were playing the White Sox in Boston in 1919, and he hit a home run off Lefty Williams over the left-field fence in the ninth inning and won the game. It was majestic. It soared."],"Waka Flocka Flame":["No matter how you're feeling, a little dog gunna love you.","It's a total big difference between a person that got lyrics and a person that can make hit singles. I'm a person that can make some hit singles. I'm not in no booth trying to be a lyrical genius. I'm preparing to make me some singles, and as I develop as a man, then they'll respect my emcee skills.","I came from nothing really to something; I came from the gutter to making the gutters.","I joined PETA for minks and dogs. I need my beef, my chicken, my seafood.","I don't eat red meat.","Waka Flocka is a product, a franchise, a brand, a label... And a good guy!","I got with PETA for a fur campaign, specifically for fur.","You wear fur, it's like you trying to be something you not. You get fur, you can spend the same money on like, 30 jackets.","I didn't get into rap to be no lyrical genius. I got into rap to feed my family and help the people in need around me, that's it. A lot of people say, 'Man, Waka Flocka ain't go no lyrics,' so I was like, 'Yeah, you right!'","I don't project no image. I just act like myself. I write about how I feel, the emotional stage I'm in at the time. So I write from the heart. I never write from my mind. My brain, I mean.","My original name was Juaquin, and my cousin couldn't pronounce my name right. So he'd just be saying 'Waka! Waka!' So when I was younger, I used to always laugh, then my man Gucci gave me the rest of the name.","My favorite thing about being engaged is your partner knowing what you want. For us, we love going out to eat."],"Waldemar Januszczak":["The real problem with the art world is not the money men scavenging in its wake - they've always been there - but the pirates who've taken over the ship. I am thinking, of course, of that awful art world species: the curator.","When I started writing about art, there were no curators."],"Wale":["The ability to make somebody feel something: that's art. However you look at it, whether you're an author, a painter, a singer, a rapper, a spoken-word artist - art.","I dated a lot, but I never really had anyone who was worthy of an anniversary. And most girlfriends never made it to a year, anyway.","I'm never satisfied, man. I'm Virgo. We overanalyze and we're never satisfied. So I'm gonna keep going 'til the wheels fall off.","No days off. I'm a workaholic.","I'm a passionate person, to a fault at times.","Not to sound corny, but intelligence is big. Everything fades, and everything can be modified. But intelligence is something you can't fake. I'm not even talking about whether you can read a thesaurus backwards. But there is a beauty in common sense.","I'm at like 325 pairs right now, give or take. But I've given away about 200 pairs of sneakers. I'm not as big of a collector as I used to be, because I think the game just got weird. Everybody likes to collect now, so it's kind of corny. But I got the essentials.","I dated all these girls and ended up not liking them and thought to myself, 'What was it that all of them had in common?' They had too much time on their hands. Even though they were pretty, they lacked something. A woman could be less attractive but with ambition and drive, that's the most beautiful thing.","I've always been a Nike person.","However, people need to understand that it ain't that deep to try and convince people of what your persona is. You are who you are, and what you are will show in time. What you aren't can be hidden, but eventually it will come to light. Long story short: rappers should never take themselves too seriously.","My job is to inspire the people, to be on top of my game and push my culture forward.","Not to sound bad, but some girls are dumb. It's because they spend so much of their life trying to have the right look. On the other hand, some girls are just really smart. There are girls you can have conversations with that are healthy conversations. You can argue real life issues and solve problems together. That is what makes a woman sexy.","There are certain things that can be asked that get me excited. It's never a thing where I think I'm too good, I'm just the type of person who likes to be enlightened. I don't like to go through the motions.","I'm a black man in the United States of America, so I always feel like there's a target on me.","I'm insecure about things. I'm not afraid to say it, though. Even when my publicist is like, 'Go on the red carpet,' I don't wanna go.","The first thing that's important is to really have people believe in you. If you have that, you can do anything.","Hip-hop is all about impact, baby. You can sell records, you can be two-times platinum, you can be gold... but if you lame, you lame, man. We try to provide the exact opposite of that. It's style, individuality, confidence. We exude that.","Not everybody is a great rapper; not everybody lives for the art of lyricism.","I don't wanna sound pretentious talking about myself.","I don't be remembering women that I've met before. I don't remember people as a whole. It's crazy. A lot of times, people get in their feelings, like, 'You don't remember me?!'","I used to have a real passion for writing, but not so much anymore - probably because I do too much of it.","My life is better than a lot of people I know. I'm definitely happy about that.","If someone doesn't have a reason to not like you in America, they talk politics or religion. Then they get to hate you and we get to be enemies.","I can take an opinion, but I don't like when you try and spew hate and contaminate the way other people think. I feel like I'm one of the people that's always made music for the common man. That's why I don't really live my life the way I could. I don't stunt as much as I could stunt, 'cause that's not who my music is for.","I want to be on a show that's not sensitive to racial jokes; I want to be on one where they call me everything and I call them right back. There's blatant racism going both ways. That's what we need.","Basically, the Internet is just the way now. It's the end-all, be-all of self-promotion. It's not like you got to burn CDs and pass them out or sell them. The Internet is a tool that reaches billions and billions of people. It's like a no-brainer to tie it in with self-promotion, or even label promotion.","The Web is the new way to figure out who's hot and what's not. You can't let TV dictate because it's so polished, so political. It is what they want you to know. The Internet is the raw.","I never had money; I like nice things, but I don't let that run my life. At the same time, I have to let something drive me... so now I let the money drive me.","I don't want to be one of those guys that you see who made $4 million, invested $3.5 million, and now you work at Wendy's.","All the rappers my age are getting Audemars and Rolexes. I want to find my own thing. That's why I travel the world - for me, that's my B-side, why we go places. I have a Hublot on from time to time but I want a home base watch - something that's elegant but has got a little pizzazz to it.","When we were in D.C. my daddy used to cut his hair with a bowl. Crucial. If you're African, Haitan, Jamaican or even more poor than the people in the project, you'll know about that.","I worked at a hot dog place, a bagel place, the Jersey Store and the hottest fashion joint around. I was getting too famous to work there anymore. I was almost showing up as a joke. I made $2,000 on my show the previous night and I'm going to go shopping during my five-hour shift.","Everything's pretty consistent in the industry, you know. There's a couple of naysayers, whatever, people who don't agree. But for the most part a lot of people believe in the new class of MC's that coming to the game.","I'm very proud of my Nigerian heritage. I wasn't fortunate enough to be raised in a heavy Nigerian environment, because my parents were always working. My father was with D.C. Cabs and my mother worked in fast food and was a nurse.","We lived in a one-bedroom apartment in Northwest D.C. I was essentially raised by a Panamanian man and a Jamaican woman. That's why I have such a fascination with Jamaican food.","Mix-tapes are something that have been going on for a while. They've been pretty important to hip-hop for the past 10 years. It's the way we advertise our music to the public for free.","You don't necessarily pick the singles that you want when you're making a record, but for the most part it's the same process. You're the artist - you make the music that you want to make.","In terms of 'Seinfeld', I think there's lot of reality in a show that's supposed to be about nothing.","Sometimes I'm happy - you can tell via Twitter. Sometimes I'm pissed off - you can tell via Twitter. I just think, at the end of the day, I don't want them to see me as a celebrity; I just want them to see me and say, 'He's like a regular person at his job right now who's mad.'","I go out, but not too much. When I'm on tour, I just write a lot of music and sleep.","I'm learning as I go. I don't know everything. I never had anybody to look at, nobody ever taught me, and where I'm from I didn't have any famous role models.","Ruzzle's my therapy. When I get off the stage from a packed show and I'm exhausted, I'll just go Ruzzle for like a good 30 minutes.","I used to switch up my cologne every two to three months, get a new wave - Dolce, Versace, Burberry. But Black Orchid, that joint stayed. That's the smell of beauty that stays on you... and girls love Tom Ford.","It's a trend to insult Wale, like that makes you cool on the Internet, and a part of it is because I respond.","I'd love a super human memory. My memory has never been good.","A lot of my female fans discovered me through the passion I have for bettering myself. Not to say the dudes don't, but my female fan-base is based off women who want to do better.","I hope everybody thinks they've got the best album. I wouldn't have put mine out if I didn't think it was the best.","I feel like I'm one of the more creative artists in the game. I think I'm going to be here for a while.","There's no way you can win when you're the president; you've got to be the scapegoat for America's issues.","I'm fortunate enough to be living my dreams and a lot of other peoples' dreams.","Every artist is supposed to get emotional. You're painting pictures of emotions.","You can be a rapper born and raised in go-go music, violence, drugs, crack, Reagonomics, and still, if you hear 'Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go,' you're going to find a way to hum along. Guilty pleasures? It don't matter. Sue me - I like the song. To dance to it is another matter.","I like David Beckham just because of his lifestyle. He don't ever need to score another goal again. How many times has he been on the cover of GQ?","I've seen all types of women. Celebrity girls I've dated and regular 9 to 5 girls. I've had shows where married women have tried to follow me to my hotel. My perception of women isn't very ignorant because I've seen a lot.","My dream tour would be like, me, Cole, Drake, Sean, Meek. I think that would be dope, something like that; big venues.","I put my foot in my mouth sometimes. I'll be the first to admit it.","I come from a place, with all due respect, who's never had a music star in hip-hop. So the odds is already against me.","I take a lot of pride in my live show and put more energy there than I do in the studio.","Making love is, simply put, poetry in motion.","I never understood the idea that I was a 'backpack rapper.' I think that's a lazy way that people started thinking. They like saying that because I got dreads. I look like I belong a certain place, so it's easy to put everything in a box.","I've become a workaholic. When the shows slow down and there's no press and I can get my time to myself in the studio with my music, I get into this zone, man. I enter this incredible space where I'm just making music. And I feel like I can work with anybody - with Elton John, with Hanson - and I can make something incredible.","I speak my mind. That's what we loved Tupac for.","I'm a regular person. I know a lot of people love being famous. I don't like it. I'm just chillin'. YouknowwhatI'msayin'?","D.C.'s a tough place to get love unless you're from D.C. It's like everybody hates you here. The only black person that everyone can agree on is Obama.","As much as I don't want to admit it, my fans are the only ones that can hurt my feelings when they're not pleased with what I'm presenting. I want it to be perfect for them. I want them to have a different sense of pride in my music."],"Walead Beshty":["I try to consider each body of work on its own terms, discretely, so terms like 'sculpture' or 'photography', in their broad sense, don't really enter into my thinking.","I was interested in making work that physically changed as it circulated through the art world.","I certainly like it if the work is beautiful, but that's a surplus effect. I can only think about that after I consider how it's made.","My works look to how images are produced, but specially based upon how the material reacts.","There's a generative material relationship between the material and the image that comes up.","It's extremely difficult to say what one actually means by 'sculpture' other than, in a provisional sense, it's something that goes on the floor or a pedestal, and loosely applies to a certain history of the use of that term."],"Walid Jumblatt":["Lebanon will be engulfed again in a huge power game that will last quite a long time. This is the tragic destiny of Lebanon.","The violence and burnings in Lebanon were the work of Syrian soldiers and workers dressed in civilian clothes.","How dangerous emperors are when they go mad.","I condemn what happened in Madrid, but it is suspicious. If tomorrow there will be another bombing, in France for example, who will gain power? Of course not Jacques Chirac, but Le Pen.","No one can live under degradation.","The consequence of Mr. Bush's and Blair's historic lie that the reason for invading Iraq was weapons of mass destruction, is that everything is being doubted.","The U.S. always needs an enemy. It comes and goes. Today it is Islam.

The killing of U.S. soldiers in Iraq is legitimate and obligatory.","Don't forget we are in a state of war and no peace. But it's very dynamic and challenging compared to the rest of the Arab world.","I know something quite sure. We'll never have peace with this Syrian regime. They'll never give us relief, and we'll never forget that.","If I have any advice to give to the Syrian president it is to cooperate for the sake of the investigation or for the sake of uncovering the truth.","Syrian influence has not ended yet. It is going to be a very long path.","The Syrian regime is helping the insurgency in Iraq and allowing all kinds of militants to come in and out, and go to Iraq to attack random soldiers and innocent people.","The Syrians are trying to say that the Lebanese are not capable of ruling themselves.","There was a president imposed by Syria. Our battle... is to have a Lebanese president that we elect.","Those who liberated the South from Israel must show allegiance to Lebanon.","We are very serious about imposing weapons restrictions on the PFLP and other Palestinian groups operating from their camps in Lebanon.","We move sometimes. We send messages to each other. We talk on the phone. Tell me, what can we do?","We will not rest until we see the suspects behind bars.","The Islamic State is a threat to both the moderate Islam headed by Mr. Saad al-Hariri and, of course, for Hezbollah. There is a convergence, an anxiety of a common enemy... which is good."],"Walid Muallem":["I think Hillary Clinton is a good and effective secretary of state.","It's very strange that you condemn me as a terrorist at the same time as you call on me to help you combat terrorism in Iraq and elsewhere. It doesn't make sense!","If a close ally of Iran like Syria went to Iran and said, 'This peace is in our interest,' what do you think would they do?

Not to be onto something is to be in despair.","We love those who know the worst of us and don't turn their faces away."],"Walker Stapleton":["As Governor, I will demand that Colorado's government serves the taxpayers of Colorado, not special interest groups and government bureaucrats.","Legislators should demand that we not go through the entire pension reform debate just to apply a band-aid when this patient needs a quadruple bypass.","I don't think Congress, in general, has done a good job articulating to the American public how inextricably linked our credit markets are to our entire economic system.","Having a credible existence in the private sector frees people to be able to be better public servants. You're less concerned with... toeing the party line and more concerned with doing what is right.","The state treasurer has authority to weigh in and take leadership roles on taxing and spending legislation.","Colorado cannot afford to become the next California, with skyrocketing taxes that hurt our state's economy and our quality of life.","If you just give somebody a blank check without any deliverables associated with that, you're not going to get the improvements that you want to get.","When I was in the private sector, I found it immensely useful to go out and talk to customers and co-workers.","That's where the good ideas come from: the people, not the boardroom. But you have to be willing to put in the legwork.","If a division becomes insolvent, the credit markets' reaction to that is immediate - regardless of what period of time you think you have to remedy.","When you have kids as cute as mine - offsetting my features - you need to highlight them.","We owe our public servants, from school teachers to state employees, a sustainable and well-funded retirement that they can count on.","It is my hope that I will be able to work with legislative leaders on both sides of the aisle and Gov. Hickenlooper to find a solution to fix our ailing pension system.","Reforming PERA will strengthen and improve Colorado's all-important long term standing with credit rating agencies.","There is a valid nationwide sentiment of concern over public pensions, and poor funding ratios are viewed negatively by financial markets."],"Wallace Shawn":["We are not what we seem. We are more than what we seem. The actor knows that. And because the actor knows that hidden inside himself there's a wizard and a king, he also knows that when he's playing himself in his daily life, he's playing a part, he's performing, just as he's performing when he plays a part on stage.","I probably have a higher opinion of my writing than the average person, at least when I'm in a good mood, but I don't really think of my plays as only being relevant to a particular month or year.","'The Princess Bride' is by far the most popular film I've ever done. I don't think I'll ever top it.","I choose parts because I don't want to be embarrassed when the movie comes out. What if my friends were to see the movie? What if my niece or nephew wandered into the theater and saw the movie? I don't want to be too ashamed of it.","Contrary to the popular misconception, the actor is not necessarily a specialist in imitating or portraying what he knows about other people. On the contrary, the actor may simply be a person who's more willing than others to reveal some truths about himself.","'The Fever' is a one-person play. I decided I would perform it myself, and I decided I would not perform it in theaters, because the character in the play says certain things that I meant.","Even with my wife, I find sharing soup is hard.","I have been vain since birth. I expected other people to like what I did, although my vanity has definitely diminished over the years.","I never planned to be an actor. It turned out I could make a living doing it.","I see myself as a citizen of the planet. Even as a child, I always found it mindless to root for your own team. I was puzzled by the fact that people said their own team was better than other teams simply because it was theirs.","I sincerely believe that if Bush and Cheney recognized the full humanity of other people's mothers around the world, they wouldn't commit the crimes they commit.","For me, a play is a form of writing which isn't complete until it is interpreted by actors. But it's still a form of writing. And so most of my time is spent thinking about how to write a sentence.","It is hard enough to make a plan for how you are going to spend an evening with somebody else. So to make a plan for how you are going to behave in 25 years seems based on a view of life that is incomprehensible to me.","We're in an emergency situation. The United States has become an absolutely terrifying country, and I would hope that I could participate in some way in stopping the horror and the brutality.","I do things, and other people laugh at them. I rarely know what the joke is supposed to be or why they're laughing.","I don't happen to have a sense of humor personally, so I don't know what's funny about a character... This happens to be a feature of my life generally.","The actor's role in the community is quite unlike anyone else's. Businessmen, for example, don't take their clothes off or cry in front of strangers in the course of their work. Actors do.","Interestingly, the actress who, in her own persona, may be gentle, shy, and socially awkward, someone whose hand trembles when pouring a cup of tea for a visiting friend, can convincingly portray an elegant, cruel aristocrat tossing off malicious epigrams in an eighteenth-century chocolate house.","I'm not proud to be me, I'm not excited to be me, but I find that I am me, and like most other individuals, I send out little signals; I tell everyone else how everything looks from where I am.","I have more free time than a lot of individuals, so, instead of talking, I sometimes write.","I wrote my first play at the age of 10, 55 years ago, and I've always found it a fantastic relief to imagine I know what things would be like from the point of view of other individuals and to send out signals from where I actually am not. Playwrights never need to write from the place where they are.","My personal life is lived as 'me,' but my professional life is lived as other people. In other words, when I go to the office, I lie down, dream, and become 'someone else.' That's my job.","In an amusement park, you can go on a roller coaster that carries you up and down, or you can go on another kind of ride that whirls you around in a circle. Similarly, there are different sorts of entertaining experiences in the theater.","You can go to a play that is enjoyable because it's funny, and then on the next night you can go to a play that's enjoyable because it's 'disturbing.'","I have an enormous appetite to see life as I know it presented in front of my eyes.","When I was a child, I did always feel that people were hiding things, and that they weren't expressing their true feelings. When adults are too complicated, and cover their emotions with layers of well-intentioned subterfuge, the child isn't seeing reality clearly enough and gets upset.","In my mind, the plays I was writing were extreme examples of art for art's sake. I didn't necessarily think that other people would love them, though I thought they probably would.","When I was first exposed to the films of Ingmar Bergman, I found them frank and disturbing portraits of the world we live in, but that was not something that displeased me. They were beautiful. I thought people would respond to my plays the way I responded to Bergman's films.","I have been vain since birth.","My plays have been strange from the beginning, and they never got unstrange.","I don't see that many plays, and for me, musicals are rarely pleasing.","I'm afraid that the passage of time is mostly lost on me. If you were to open up my head you would see that I'm still brooding about statements, songs and issues from the third grade. The years between 1980 and today went by very, very quickly.","I'm a very lucky man. It's a beautiful thing for a writer, to see people allowing your words to enter their own unconscious and their souls.","I think the whole system of education would change if I were in charge and had the ability to make changes. I don't think I would keep Princeton exactly being Princeton.","I don't have a television, and I'm just not too up on television.","And my singing, I don't think I could sing Wagner or opera, but I could probably carry a tune. I was in a musical once, but it was never performed.","I never grew up thinking, 'One day I will play so and so' because I wasn't expecting to be an actor at all.","I know that I am one and I've made a living as an actor and I enjoy being an actor, but when I'm not actually doing it, I forget that I do it.","There's nothing regular about my life at all, really. I don't keep a regular schedule and every day is different. It's all rather chaotic.","You know, I haven't written as much as most other writers. Certainly maybe those who keep a more regular schedule accomplish more.","The life of an actor can be very enviable.","I was making my living from a joke about my appearance that I didn't understand, and in a way still don't, because when I look in a mirror it doesn't seem funny to me.","I'm being mocked because I don't live up to a socially determined view of what other people think a person should look like.","In terms of number of movies, I've been in an extraordinary amount. If you count only the minutes I'm onscreen, it's not so long.","In real life, every person is the leading man or woman. We don't think of ourselves as supporting or character actors.","Acting is trying to be absolutely truthful; to get audiences to believe that you are a dean, when, actually, not only are you not the dean, but if you walked into the building they'd probably throw you out. That's very hard.","Before I was 5, I did have a lot of time on my hands. I had no job and really no career, and I spent an awful lot of time listening to records. It was more the classical ones, really - Prokofiev, and I think there was some Mozart in there, and more impressionistic composers like Delius.","My father was a jazz listener, and I think, at least before I was 5, I was not so into that. Although there were records that emphasized percussion that I liked, like Baby Dodds.","I led the life of an intellectual up until a certain age. I remember Freud's 'Interpretation of Dreams' was a big favorite when I was 11. It sounded so interesting. And it really was!","Children, I always think, are just putting on a performance of being naive and not understanding anything. I have worked with children in films, and they're treated as adults and they just drop the pretense of being children.","Acting is an escape from the boring person that I am in real life.","I spend most of my time thinking about things like laundry and buying stationery supplies.","I am recognized a lot for 'Clueless,' but I am recognized a great deal for 'The Princess Bride.' I don't know... maybe everybody who has seen that movie just goes out on the street.","In my early 20s, I studied history and politics, and I really thought that perhaps I would devote my life to that.","I grew up. I began to think the United States had some problems that really required the help of artistic people to solve. And I gave myself permission to be a writer instead of a civil servant.","From being a writer of plays, it was not that surprising that somebody thought of giving me a job as an actor. After I played one part, others came along.","For some reason, people find me funny. It's quite hard to define why a thought is funny. It's even harder to define why a person would be funny. It's a word that I can't define at all. But whether I know quite what it is or not, I seem to be it.","Patriotism is considered to be an emotion a person ought to feel. But why? Why is it nobler to love your own country than to love someone else's?","As writers, we can't predict who might come along who might find our offerings valuable.","But because we've all been readers, we know what the experience is like, and we hope that what certain writers have given to us, we will give to someone.","When I was first starting to write plays, I quite literally had never heard of the idea of studying playwriting. I wouldn't have studied it even if I had heard of it.","I started writing plays in around 1967, and at a certain point, I thought, 'I'm writing plays, I should learn about acting and what it is.' So I went to the HB Studio in New York, and I was there for about nine months.","After being in one movie, it didn't seem like that would be my life. I had done several jobs, briefly. I'd been a shipping clerk, I worked in a copy shop, I didn't think the acting was going to go on and on.","If I had even the tiniest scrap of advice to give to a young actor who was figuring out how to audition, I would say don't memorize the script... The reality about auditions is that 98 percent of the results has to do with what you are, not with what you did in the audition."],"Wallace Stegner":["A teacher enlarges people in all sorts of ways besides just his subject matter.","Most things break, including hearts. The lessons of life amount not to wisdom, but to scar tissue and callus.","Hard writing makes easy reading."],"Wallace Stevens":["Perhaps the truth depends on a walk around the lake.","The day of the sun is like the day of a king. It is a promenade in the morning, a sitting on the throne at noon, a pageant in the evening.","The most beautiful thing in the world is, of course, the world itself.","In the world of words, the imagination is one of the forces of nature.","Accuracy of observation is the equivalent of accuracy of thinking.","The only emperor is the emperor of ice cream.","Our bloom is gone. We are the fruit thereof.","Death is the mother of Beauty; hence from her, alone, shall come fulfillment to our dreams and our desires.","Everything is complicated; if that were not so, life and poetry and everything else would be a bore.","Thought is an infection. In the case of certain thoughts, it becomes an epidemic.","How full of trifles everything is! It is only one's thoughts that fill a room with something more than furniture.","Poor, dear, silly Spring, preparing her annual surprise!","Most people read poetry listening for echoes because the echoes are familiar to them. They wade through it the way a boy wades through water, feeling with his toes for the bottom: The echoes are the bottom.","The genuine artist is never 'true to life.' He sees what is real, but not as we are normally aware of it. We do not go storming through life like actors in a play. Art is never real life.","The point of vision and desire are the same.","As life grows more terrible, its literature grows more terrible.","The reason can give nothing at all Like the response to desire.","Style is not something applied. It is something that permeates. It is of the nature of that in which it is found, whether the poem, the manner of a god, the bearing of a man. It is not a dress.","Money is a kind of poetry.","To regard the imagination as metaphysics is to think of it as part of life, and to think of it as part of life is to realize the extent of artifice. We live in the mind.","A poem need not have a meaning and like most things in nature often does not have.","We say God and the imagination are one... How high that highest candle lights the dark.","The way through the world is more difficult to find than the way beyond it.","Intolerance respecting other people's religion is toleration itself in comparison with intolerance respecting other people's art.","The philosopher proves that the philosopher exists. The poet merely enjoys existence.","In poetry, you must love the words, the ideas and the images and rhythms with all your capacity to love anything at all.","I do not know which to prefer, The beauty of inflections, Or the beauty of innuendoes, The blackbird whistling, Or just after.","It can never be satisfied, the mind, never.","New York is a field of tireless and antagonistic interests undoubtedly fascinating but horribly unreal. Everybody is looking at everybody else a foolish crowd walking on mirrors.","One's ignorance is one's chief asset.","Reality is not what it is. It consists of the many realities which it can be made into.","After the final no there comes a yes and on that yes the future of the world hangs.","A poet looks at the world the way a man looks at a woman.","If some really acute observer made as much of egotism as Freud has made of sex, people would forget a good deal about sex and find the explanation for everything in egotism.","One cannot spend one's time in being modern when there are so many more important things to be.","The imagination is man's power over nature.","What our eyes behold may well be the text of life but one's meditations on the text and the disclosures of these meditations are no less a part of the structure of reality.","It is the unknown that excites the ardor of scholars, who, in the known alone, would shrivel up with boredom.","The poet is the priest of the invisible.","Perhaps it is of more value to infuriate philosophers than to go along with them.","Nothing could be more inappropriate to American literature than its English source since the Americans are not British in sensibility.","The fire burns as the novel taught it how.","If poetry should address itself to the same needs and aspirations, the same hopes and fears, to which the Bible addresses itself, it might rival it in distribution."],"Wallis Simpson":["For a gallant spirit there can never be defeat.","A woman's life can really be a succession of lives, each revolving around some emotionally compelling situation or challenge, and each marked off by some intense experience.","Never explain, never complain.","You can never be too rich or too thin.","You have no idea how hard it is to live out a great romance.","Forgive me for not writing but this man is exhausting.","I hate this place. I shall hate it to my grave.","I never make a trip to the United States without visiting a supermarket. To me they are more fascinating than any fashion salon.","PS: It's all gossip about the prince. I'm not in the habit of taking my girlfriends' beaux.","I am so anxious for you not to abdicate and I think the fact that you do is going to put me in the wrong light to the entire world because they will say that I could have prevented it.","I look a hundred and weigh 110 - you won't love me when you see the wreck England has made me.","I have always had the courage for the new things that life sometimes offers."],"Wally Amos":["Nothing is an obstacle unless you say it is.","I believe, along with many others, that you must first ask for what you want before you can have it.","I lost a company. So what? It's just stuff. Can't take it with you.","In some areas I am more noted for reading then I am for cookies!","Many who resort to crime ultimately can't read or write.","Email is the greatest thing."],"Wally George":["I am always the 'good guy', and I take on the idiotic jerks of the nation.","I learned that kids in show business are so different from regular, average students. They would gather behind you and help you to succeed in any way possible."],"Wally Lamb":["Accept what people offer. Drink their milkshakes. Take their love.","When I was a kid, I was surrounded by girls: older sisters, older girl cousins just down the street... except for an older boy named Vito who threw rocks. Each year I would wish for a baby brother. It never happened.","Human behavior in the midst of hardship caught my attention very early on, and my first stories were all pictures, no words.","However far fiction writers stray from their own lives and experiences - and I stray pretty far from mine - I think, ultimately, that we may be writing what we need to write in some way, albeit unconsciously.","When I was a kid... I needed to belong.","As my early drawings warned me, where humans go, lions and tidal waves follow.","Love stories are probably all I've ever been able to write or want to write.","Love comes in far more shapes and sizes than what the family-values crowd condones, of course.","The roundness of life's design may be a sign that there is a presence beyond ourselves.","I like to be surprised. The best writing is when it defies me, when it starts going a different way than I had planned.","I wanted to connect a modern story with a myth that I had read.","I love the most the students with troubled lives.","I like to write first-person because I like to become the character I'm writing.","I think I write fiction for the opportunity to get beyond the limits of my own life."],"Wally Schirra":["We spent a lot of time in simulators. We were going to do it right.","When a man looks across a street, sees a pretty girl, and waves at her, that's not a rendezvous, that's a passing acquaintance. When he walks across the street and nibbles on her ear, that's a rendezvous!","Dad went to Canada to learn how to fly with the Royal Canadian Air Force. He took me on my first airplane ride, where I could have a hand on the stick.","I was told having a website would help me. I have yet to figure out why my life story needs to be on the web.","NASA should start thinking about this planet.","Another real problem was over putting our helmets on for re-entry, because we all had severe head colds. They couldn't come up there and make us. Houston, you have a problem!","At the end of our NASA careers, no one had a place for us in the military.","Each test pilot I know considers him, or herself, now that there are women, to be the very best. It's very demeaning to step down the ladder once in a while.","He who commands an Apollo flight will not command a second one.","I don't go along with going to Moon first to build a launch pad to go to Mars. We should go to Mars from Earth orbit. We have already been to the Moon; we've already practiced.","I don't think the space station will ever do anything for exploration. Putting people up there for a year or more is the only way you will get anywhere near the exploration concept.","I played English football - soccer - instead of American football, because we couldn't afford the equipment.","I remember seeing war hero Jimmy Doolittle fly a Gee Bee racer there. He was my childhood hero. Many years later, I was lucky enough to go hunting with him.","I saw the booster, not Sputnik, flying by, and I said, maybe this is the way we should be going, not just sitting back waiting for something to happen.","I've always thought space station is a great name. It should be like a gas station where we go for service and supplies before heading further out.","John Glenn craved the publicity. I think even John would admit that. When he went into politics, that became pretty obvious! He knew how to do public relations.","Kennedy had made a mess in Cuba at the Bay of Pigs. He had to do something to look good. The Apollo program of going to the Moon was quite a goal.","Kids today don't want to get married. Too many of their friends have been married and divorced already. They just don't believe in it.","Some of the wives didn't keep up with the program. It started breaking apart during the Apollo days.","When a test pilot comes off a flight, there is typically another pilot who is going to take it up, and he believes in the debriefing. You don't keep something to yourself.","When people have asked if I'd like to go in the Shuttle, I said you don't get to fly it, except for landing, which I'd love to do. I wouldn't go unless I could command it."],"Walshy Fire":["Notting Hill is a very different carnival from anywhere else. This is an international city, so it represents everybody. You walk around every corner here, you'll hear something new. It's awesome.","Dancehall culture in Europe is very close to Jamaica. Europe and Japan have a very close link to Jamaican dancehall culture, where it's all about sound-systems and horns and girls dancing all crazy - that happens a lot in those places.","Junior Blender is a hardcore dancehall head. He's in Supersonic, which is one of the top soundclash sound-systems in Europe.","Here's the key to Jamaica, the secret to Jamaican dancehall parties, no matter where you are in the world. If you do not see Japanese people, you're at the wrong party. They source authenticity like no other culture I've ever seen.","Dancing doesn't have a language.","I'm from Miami, and Diplo is from Fort Lauderdale. We grew up with a lot of Cuban and Haitian friends.","We like to be the people who go - can go out into the world and say we're the people seeking places that need bridges built and need the kind of energy that we bring, and then actively doing the show. We will pay for it ourselves. We just want to bring the kind of enjoyment that we know we can bring.","If there's anything that would unite the world, it would be music.","I have a saying: I try to make the world smaller by making the party bigger.","Nowadays, people have an open mind vis-a-vis new artists like Meghan Trainor, Nico & Vinz, Hozier - there are hits coming out of everywhere.","We're doing unusual records that sound big, have a pop feel, and we're getting better at it.","The sound system influence is undeniable in hip-hop, in jungle, drum and bass, now EDM.","The energy Major Lazer presents on stage is guided by sound system sessions of years ago.","We won't be in any reggae publications or websites."],"Walt Alston":["It's not the winter that bothers me - it's the summers.","Fans tend to get too excited by streaks of either kind and I think the press does too. There should be a happy medium.","Look at misfortune the same way you look at success - Don't Panic! Do you best and forget the consequences.","More than anyone else, Hank Aaron made me wish I wasn't a manager.","Perhaps the truest axiom in baseball is that the toughest thing to do is repeat.","I'd rather win two or three, lose one, win two or three more. I'm a great believer in things evening out. If you win a whole bunch in a row, somewhere along the line you're going to lose some too."],"Walt Disney":["If you can dream it, you can do it.","All our dreams can come true, if we have the courage to pursue them.","We keep moving forward, opening new doors, and doing new things, because we're curious and curiosity keeps leading us down new paths.","The way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing.","All the adversity I've had in my life, all my troubles and obstacles, have strengthened me... You may not realize it when it happens, but a kick in the teeth may be the best thing in the world for you.","Times and conditions change so rapidly that we must keep our aim constantly focused on the future.","The more you like yourself, the less you are like anyone else, which makes you unique.","When you're curious, you find lots of interesting things to do.","You can design and create, and build the most wonderful place in the world. But it takes people to make the dream a reality.","It's kind of fun to do the impossible.","You're dead if you aim only for kids. Adults are only kids grown up, anyway.","I only hope that we don't lose sight of one thing - that it was all started by a mouse.","When you believe in a thing, believe in it all the way, implicitly and unquestionable.","Mickey Mouse popped out of my mind onto a drawing pad 20 years ago on a train ride from Manhattan to Hollywood at a time when business fortunes of my brother Roy and myself were at lowest ebb and disaster seemed right around the corner.","Disneyland will never be completed. It will continue to grow as long as there is imagination left in the world.","Our heritage and ideals, our code and standards - the things we live by and teach our children - are preserved or diminished by how freely we exchange ideas and feelings.","There is more treasure in books than in all the pirate's loot on Treasure Island.","I always like to look on the optimistic side of life, but I am realistic enough to know that life is a complex matter.","Animation offers a medium of story telling and visual entertainment which can bring pleasure and information to people of all ages everywhere in the world.","I don't like formal gardens. I like wild nature. It's just the wilderness instinct in me, I guess.","Movies can and do have tremendous influence in shaping young lives in the realm of entertainment towards the ideals and objectives of normal adulthood.","Laughter is America's most important export.","I love Mickey Mouse more than any woman I have ever known.","I would rather entertain and hope that people learned something than educate people and hope they were entertained.","Of all the things I've done, the most vital is coordinating those who work with me and aiming their efforts at a certain goal.","A man should never neglect his family for business.","You reach a point where you don't work for money.","Disneyland is a work of love. We didn't go into Disneyland just with the idea of making money.","We have created characters and animated them in the dimension of depth, revealing through them to our perturbed world that the things we have in common far outnumber and outweigh those that divide us.","Animation can explain whatever the mind of man can conceive. This facility makes it the most versatile and explicit means of communication yet devised for quick mass appreciation.","Mickey Mouse is, to me, a symbol of independence. He was a means to an end.","Of all of our inventions for mass communication, pictures still speak the most universally understood language.","I believe in being an innovator.","We believed in our idea - a family park where parents and children could have fun- together.","Disneyland is the star, everything else is in the supporting role.","When people laugh at Mickey Mouse, it's because he's so human; and that is the secret of his popularity.","We did it Disneyland, in the knowledge that most of the people I talked to thought it would be a financial disaster - closed and forgotten within the first year.","You can't just let nature run wild.","There's nothing funnier than the human animal.","I do not like to repeat successes, I like to go on to other things.","I have been up against tough competition all my life. I wouldn't know how to get along without it.","We allow no geniuses around our Studio.","All cartoon characters and fables must be exaggeration, caricatures. It is the very nature of fantasy and fable.","Animation is different from other parts. Its language is the language of caricature. Our most difficult job was to develop the cartoon's unnatural but seemingly natural anatomy for humans and animals.","We are not trying to entertain the critics. I'll take my chances with the public.","I started, actually, to make my first animated cartoon in 1920. Of course, they were very crude things then and I used sort of little puppet things.","People still think of me as a cartoonist, but the only thing I lift a pen or pencil for these days is to sign a contract, a check, or an autograph.","Crowded classrooms and half-day sessions are a tragic waste of our greatest national resource - the minds of our children.","I'd say it's been my biggest problem all my life... it's money. It takes a lot of money to make these dreams come true.","I try to build a full personality for each of our cartoon characters - to make them personalities.","I never called my work an 'art'. It's part of show business, the business of building entertainment.","It's no secret that we were sticking just about every nickel we had on the chance that people would really be interested in something totally new and unique in the field of entertainment.","Whenever I go on a ride, I'm always thinking of what's wrong with the thing and how it can be improved.","I am not influenced by the techniques or fashions of any other motion picture company.","I have no use for people who throw their weight around as celebrities, or for those who fawn over you just because you are famous.","Disneyland is a show."],"Walt Dohrn":["'Trolls' was a blank slate - there was no world, no mythology. We talked a lot about the Grinch and we liked how they showed his heart growing, but how do you show a photographable device like that for the Bergens? We ended up using color for a lot of that: desaturating and then pulling the saturation up.","I like old Disney films that have an edge to them.","I'm pretty much a dinosaur in the studio. I like things hand-drawn, even today. The story artists use Cintiqs, but I'm the only person who hasn't completely converted to computers. I like the Cintiq, but there's something about the raw emotional power of using paper and pencil."],"Walt Handelsman":["It's fun to take two topics and mix them into one cartoon.","Be happy that you're growing older, that you're maturing, that you're smarter, that you're wiser.","Youth is really in your attitude, not in what you look like.","There are a lot of really great cartoonists out there. It's nice to be thought of as one of them.","It's one thing to get a letter from your kid at camp telling you he wants to come home. It's another to get a letter from a grown child saying they're coming back to live with you!","We have to be able to poke fun at ourselves.","Once Clinton won, I started picking on him.","I don't think you can beat your audience over the head with hard-hitting cartoons day after day after day.","I think some days you should do a cartoon that is absolutely just for the laugh, and some days you should do a cartoon that just punches the reader right in the stomach. It's kind of nice to mix it up.","Animated editorial cartoons are completely different from static editorial cartoons.","People really love editorial cartoons, and I think publishers understand that.","I still do the standard editorial cartoon: that is my bread and butter. I absolutely love doing that.","With a standard editorial cartoon, you're taking tons of information and synthesizing it down to a single bite - a single moment in time. With animated editorial cartoons, it's more storytelling.","Political hypocrisy and racism make me hot under the collar.","I work hard at my job, and I guess hard work pays off.","Student cartoonists as well as professionals should always be careful that they're not doing a cartoon that already has been done."],"Walt Kelly":["It is not good enough for things to be planned - they still have to be done; for the intention to become a reality, energy has to be launched into operation.","Women aren't as mere as they used to be.","Every burden is a blessing.","We have met the enemy and he is us.","We are confronted with insurmountable opportunities.","In like a dimwit, out like a light."],"Walt Mossberg":["I see retirement as just another of these reinventions, another chance to do new things and be a new version of myself.","Streaming TV shows, movies, and other types of video over the Internet to all manner of devices, once a fringe habit, is now a squarely mainstream practice. Even people still paying for cable or satellite service often also have Netflix or Hulu accounts.","In the tech world, you can reel off great products in several ways. You can have the once-in-a-lifetime gut instincts of a Steve Jobs. You can have the brainiac coding skills of a Bill Gates, Larry Page, or Sergey Brin. Or, I learned, you can have the deep intellectual curiosity and stubbornness of a Jeff Bezos.","For many years, even as users became more sophisticated, personal computers took too much effort to use without problem-solving, keeping alive the yearning for greater simplicity. Microsoft's dominant Windows platform, in particular, was a home for all manner of bugs and problems that required IT people to straighten out.","Samsung has drastically altered the rule that big screens mean huge phones. Even this smaller of the new Galaxy S models has a larger screen than the biggest iPhone, but it's much narrower and easier to hold and to slip into a pocket.","I believe that tablets - and especially the iPad - are extremely versatile and productive tools for consumers, schools and businesses and are better for many tasks than the PC or the smartphone.","We need a wireless mobile device ecosystem that mirrors the PC/Internet ecosystem, one where the consumers' purchase of network capacity is separate from their purchase of the hardware and software they use on that network. It will take government action, or some disruptive technology or business innovation, to get us there.","Microsoft's Windows 3.1, released in 1992, was the first truly successful edition of Windows and juiced the Redmond juggernaut. Apple's Macintosh System 7.5, released in 1994, was another in a string of versions that lacked key architectural features that the Mac didn't have until Steve Jobs returned and brought with him the code that became OS X.","The textile industry became a huge deal in 19th century America, kind of like the tech industry is today. And that immigrant tradition continues, especially in tech, America's most dominant and dynamic industry today.","Apple's advantage is that it designs and builds software together, so if the software isn't excellent, it does the superlative hardware a disservice.","In 1998, it was possible to make a big-screen romantic comedy about email. Yep, email - the same medium we often think of now as boring and even annoying.","No computer or smartphone can ever be considered 100 percent 'safe.' We're all engaged in a perpetual battle with criminals and hostile governments trying to use computers and the Internet to steal information and identities.","I've been on the Web from the beginning of the Web. The good part about writing about technology is that you never run out of ideas, because it's changing so fast. The bad part is that it's changing so fast that there's a million new products and ideas every day and every week.","There's no other major item most of us own that is as confusing, unpredictable and unreliable as our personal computers.","The next time you're driving from New York to Boston on I-95, you should make a little detour in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, to visit the Old Slater Mill national historic landmark. It's the site of what is considered to be the first successful water-powered textile spinning mill in America.","Who co-founded Google? Sergey Brin, a Russian-born Jew whose family fled anti-semitism in the Soviet Union to settle here and who considers himself a refugee.","Compared to running apps on a smartphone or, more aptly, an iPad, the app experience on the Samsung Chromebook Plus is distinctly subpar.","I'm happy to report that the first Chromebook designed from the ground up to run Android apps out of the box has arrived, albeit a little past the end of 2016.","Slack spread through businesses like wildfire, initially in the tech and media sectors, but now much more widely. At its public launch in February 2014, it had 17,000 users. As of April 1st, 2016, that number had rocketed to 2.7 million daily active users.","For those still outside the cult of Slack, it's a service - available as a desktop or mobile app, or a website - which is essentially a series of public chat rooms (called channels) on topics relevant to a company or to teams within a company.","The products I review are typically lent to me by their manufacturers for a few weeks or months. I return any products I am lent for review, except for items of minor value that companies typically don't want back. In the case of these items, I either discard them or give them away to charity.","As for the device we now call a TV or a cable box, I want it to be fast with a clean interface and seamlessly upgradeable to the latest software. I want it to be the primary source of all TV, not an ancillary device.","I have on my wall right now a front page of the 'Journal' from January 1991, when I co-wrote a front-page story about Iraq firing missiles at Israel. By October, I was writing about tech products.","Man, he could sell. As he liked to say, he lived at the intersection of technology and liberal arts. But there was a more personal side of Steve Jobs, of course, and I was fortunate enough to see a bit of it because I spent hours in conversation with him over the 14 years he ran Apple.","People always worry that buying tech products today carries a risk of obsolescence. Most of the time, that fear is overblown.","I try not to make snap judgments. I never, ever make conclusions about products I've never tried.","Taken as a whole, consumer technologies have made startling advances, but they still are not as easy to use as they should be.","I think Steve Jobs is a historic figure. He's not only a historic figure in business, but really in America.","I actually looked at an Apple ad from 1978. It was a print ad. That shows you how ancient it was. And it said, 'Thousands of people have discovered the Apple computer.' Thousands of people.","Whether you are a consumer, a hardware maker, a software developer or a provider of cool new services, it's hard to make a move in the American cellphone world without the permission of the companies that own the pipes.","There's always a mismatch between small entrepreneurial outfits and large companies, which often don't have the same outlook.","I was very proud to be at 'The Wall Street Journal'. I have nothing bad to say about it. I had a great run there. In what turned out to be the final years of my tenure there, 'AllThingsD' occupied me more and more and was much more fun.","Apple very deliberately - and this was very much Steve Jobs' point of view - Apple has concentrated its cloud efforts on being invisible. So in other words, stuff just would sync and appear. You change your contacts on one of your devices, and it would appear on all your devices changed.","Who have I picked fights with over the years? Bill Gates. Google. Mark Zuckerberg. Even - despite everything that's written about my relationship with Steve Jobs - we had yelling matches.","What we did with 'AllThingsD', though, was very different. We weren't taking a newspaper and putting it on the web; we were creating a digital native product, and we did it inside of a very old, stuffy newspaper company at the time.","I shifted my career when I was 44 to quit the Washington beats. I had a great Washington beat, a series of them, and I quit to start my tech column, which was a different kind of tech column.","The Secretary of the State at the time was James Baker, who had also been Secretary of Treasury and White House Chief of Staff: very powerful guy. And I went to see him in his very ornate office at the State Department to say I wasn't going to cover him anymore. It was just a courtesy call.","I spent 19 years as a Washington reporter covering a variety of beats.","My first computers were a Timex Sinclair and an Apple II.","I wrote a lot about the need for an information appliance. I think we've pretty much arrived at one: the iPad. A child could figure out how to use it quickly. Compare it to a DOS computer or even an Apple II; it's no longer nearly as much of a hassle or a mystery.","Slack users I know, including me, love many things about the service. As the company likes to brag, it's fast, it's transparent, and it's great for brainstorming.","Though it has plenty of competitors, Slack claims to be the 'fastest growing business application in history'.","Apple is all-in on Apple hardware and still wants you to be all-in, too.","Arguably Apple's least successful core hardware product in decades, the Apple Watch could have been nursed along, like a terminal patient.","Classic cable TV may have hit its peak, but it's still a huge force, and the streaming apps of many cable networks still require you to authenticate that you're a paying cable customer every time you want to use a new such TV app.","Many tech company execs who visit to pitch products take time to peruse the shelves and exclaim upon various devices they owned in younger days.","Though many people mistakenly credit IBM with the first PC in 1981, the Apple II came out four years earlier, in 1977.","Everyone knows that Apple crushed Microsoft in the mobile era. But it was exactly the opposite in the PC Wars of the 1980s and 1990s.","Has the smartphone begun to mature, plateau out?","What could a smartphone do for me that would make people go out and buy another one?","The car is the ultimate mobile device, isn't it?","Jeff Williams, Apple's senior vice president of operations, has been called 'Tim Cook's Tim Cook' by some.","I use my iPad many times a day, and it has cut my use of my laptop by more than half.","How you feel about the modern, multitouch tablet depends a lot on what you think Steve Jobs and company set out to do with the iPad back in 2010. If you believe he was out to make a bigger smartphone or to entirely replace the Mac and PC, you're wrong.","When I first reviewed the iPad, I wrote that, to succeed, 'It will have to prove that it really can replace the laptop or netbook for enough common tasks, enough of the time, to make it a viable alternative.'","What's the third smartphone platform? Is it Windows phone? Is Windows Phone going to finally get off the mat in the developed world? Amazon believes their platform has a chance to become the third.","When I walk into a Best Buy, I now see, right from the front door, a giant Apple logo. I see a giant Samsung logo. I see a giant Microsoft Windows logo. And those are stores within a store.","Back in May of 2008, the Kindle was still quite new, and we focused on that.","I've known Bezos for decades, since the very early days of Amazon, so it's no surprise to me that he's smart or willing to make big bets.","Amazon makes mistakes, including launching a smartphone in 2014 that was a flop and to which I gave a poor review.","There's a blizzard of metrics that social sites and messaging sites put out there.","You have giant Facebook, which wants people to be more engaged, and they also want to grow and trade different things, including content.","Our lives and our culture have been significantly changed and improved by hardware, software, and services developed by immigrants.","I actually think it's against the rules at Vox Media to work there if you've never dropped an iPhone.","Lauren Goode and I have agreed that the next version of the Mac software - all of them are named after places in California - should be named either Bridgeport or Warwick.","I believe... we were told that the 'Bluetooth AirPods', whatever they are, can be used on anything that supports Bluetooth audio.","Everyone looks adorable singing with James Corden.","People think of Apple as a maker of excellent premium hardware. In fact, many reviewers regard Apple devices as the best you can buy.","Apple's iTunes program was once the envy of the world. A combined digital music store and player, it could also sync your iPod. And it worked on both Mac and Windows. It was reasonably fast and very sure-footed.","My Safari bookmarks only sync intermittently across my Apple devices. Unlike Amazon's Kindle app for Apple products, the company's iBooks doesn't remember where I left off unless I set a bookmark.","I've been a regular customer at CVS Pharmacy, the country's second-largest drugstore chain, for 20 years. I've spent a small fortune there over that span, visiting several times a week to pick up everything from milk to toothpaste to prescriptions.","It turns out that CVS is one of about 40 merchants in a consortium that formed in 2011 to develop their own mobile-phone-based payment system. The consortium, called the Merchant Customer Exchange, or MCX, is in large part all about eliminating, or at least reducing, the fees banks charge retailers for swiping credit cards.","Even Apple, notorious for keeping a tight grip on its products, allows fierce competitors like Google, Amazon, Spotify, and Microsoft to offer their apps on its phones and tablets.","I simply believe that people who respect their customers and have faith in their own technology products should welcome competition and that consumer choice should be a paramount value in retailing.","I don't accept any money, free products, or anything else of value from the companies whose products I cover or from their public relations or advertising agencies.","Companies often visit my office, or invite me to theirs, to brief me on new products, Web sites, or software before they are released - usually a few weeks or days ahead of time. I don't review most of these products.","If I do decide to review a product, I sometimes negotiate with a company the timing of the review but never its outcome or tone. I sometimes strive to be the first to publish a review, but I never promise a good review in exchange for that timing.","Big screens helped propel Samsung to top-tier prominence and helped iPhone sales explode a few years later. But for many, including myself, the biggest-screen models just weren't practical, because their overall size made them too large, too bulky, and too heavy."],"Walt Whitman":["Keep your face always toward the sunshine - and shadows will fall behind you.","Let your soul stand cool and composed before a million universes.","I am as bad as the worst, but, thank God, I am as good as the best.","Be curious, not judgmental.","The art of art, the glory of expression and the sunshine of the light of letters, is simplicity.","Give me odorous at sunrise a garden of beautiful flowers where I can walk undisturbed.","I believe a leaf of grass is no less than the journey-work of the stars.","Re-examine all that you have been told... dismiss that which insults your soul.","Simplicity is the glory of expression.","Every moment of light and dark is a miracle.","I have learned that to be with those I like is enough.","To me, every hour of the day and night is an unspeakably perfect miracle.","Now I see the secret of making the best person: it is to grow in the open air and to eat and sleep with the earth.","Do I contradict myself? Very well, then I contradict myself, I am large, I contain multitudes.","Viewed freely, the English language is the accretion and growth of every dialect, race, and range of time, and is both the free and compacted composition of all.","There is no week nor day nor hour when tyranny may not enter upon this country, if the people lose their roughness and spirit of defiance.","Oh while I live, to be the ruler of life, not a slave, to meet life as a powerful conqueror, and nothing exterior to me will ever take command of me.","A morning-glory at my window satisfies me more than the metaphysics of books.","The future is no more uncertain than the present.","When I give I give myself.","We convince by our presence.","I celebrate myself, and sing myself.","And your very flesh shall be a great poem.","I accept reality and dare not question it.","Judging from the main portions of the history of the world, so far, justice is always in jeopardy.","I exist as I am, that is enough.","Whatever satisfies the soul is truth.","To have great poets, there must be great audiences.","If any thing is sacred, the human body is sacred.","After you have exhausted what there is in business, politics, conviviality, and so on - have found that none of these finally satisfy, or permanently wear - what remains? Nature remains.","The beautiful uncut hair of graves.","I see great things in baseball. It's our game - the American game.","I no doubt deserved my enemies, but I don't believe I deserved my friends.","Freedom - to walk free and own no superior.","Have you learned the lessons only of those who admired you, and were tender with you, and stood aside for you? Have you not learned great lessons from those who braced themselves against you, and disputed passage with you?","And there is no trade or employment but the young man following it may become a hero.","Nothing endures but personal qualities.","In the confusion we stay with each other, happy to be together, speaking without uttering a single word.","A great city is that which has the greatest men and women.","All faults may be forgiven of him who has perfect candor.","Have you heard that it was good to gain the day? I also say it is good to fall, battles are lost in the same spirit in which they are won.","To die is different from what any one supposed, and luckier.","Seeing, hearing, feeling, are miracles, and each part and tag of me is a miracle.","The beauty of independence, departure, actions that rely on themselves.","The genius of the United States is not best or most in its executives or legislatures, nor in its ambassadors or authors or colleges, or churches, or parlors, nor even in its newspapers or inventors, but always most in the common people.","Stranger, if you passing meet me and desire to speak to me, why should you not speak to me? And why should I not speak to you?","The words of my book nothing, the drift of it everything.","Behold I do not give lectures or a little charity, When I give I give myself.","O public road, I say back I am not afraid to leave you, yet I love you, you express me better than I can express myself.","I cannot be awake for nothing looks to me as it did before, Or else I am awake for the first time, and all before has been a mean sleep.","I heard what was said of the universe, heard it and heard it of several thousand years; it is middling well as far as it goes - but is that all?","The United States themselves are essentially the greatest poem.","The whole theory of the universe is directed unerringly to one single individual.","There is that indescribable freshness and unconsciousness about an illiterate person that humbles and mocks the power of the noblest expressive genius.","Produce great men, the rest follows.","The shallow consider liberty a release from all law, from every constraint. The wise man sees in it, on the contrary, the potent Law of Laws.","The great city is that which has the greatest man or woman: if it be a few ragged huts, it is still the greatest city in the whole world.","To the real artist in humanity, what are called bad manners are often the most picturesque and significant of all.","Let that which stood in front go behind, let that which was behind advance to the front, let bigots, fools, unclean persons, offer new propositions, let the old propositions be postponed.","Why are there trees I never walk under but large and melodious thoughts descend upon me?","He most honors my style who learns under it to destroy the teacher.","There is no object so soft but it makes a hub for the wheeled universe.","Nothing can happen more beautiful than death.","Whoever degrades another degrades me, And whatever is done or said returns at last to me.","The proof of a poet is that his country absorbs him as affectionately as he has absorbed it.","Speech is the twin of my vision, it is unequal to measure itself, it provokes me forever, it says sarcastically, Walt you contain enough, why don't you let it out then?","Henceforth I ask not good fortune. I myself am good fortune.","And I will show that nothing can happen more beautiful than death.","Other lands have their vitality in a few, a class, but we have it in the bulk of our people.","The dirtiest book of all is the expurgated book.","I say that democracy can never prove itself beyond cavil, until it founds and luxuriantly grows its own forms of art, poems, schools, theology, displacing all that exists, or that has been produced anywhere in the past, under opposite influences.","I say to mankind, Be not curious about God. For I, who am curious about each, am not curious about God - I hear and behold God in every object, yet understand God not in the least.","And whoever walks a furlong without sympathy walks to his own funeral drest in his shroud.","I find no sweeter fat than sticks to my own bones.","Here or henceforward it is all the same to me, I accept Time absolutely.","The real war will never get in the books."],"Walter Alston":["Of course managers win ball games.","The toughest thing about managing is knowing your personnel and what it can give you under all conditions.","I've won plenty of games by knowing when to take out my pitcher; whom to replace him with; or how to place my infield or outfield to defend properly against the opposing hitter.","I always liked Casey Stengel as a manager because he seemed to have a grasp of so many things.","I put myself through college playing pool.","I'm not afraid to learn from my coaches.","I do worry about tomorrow's game, but never about next year's job."],"Walter Anderson":["Bad things do happen; how I respond to them defines my character and the quality of my life.

The mass of mankind understand it, and they hardly anywhere in the world understand any other.","Men who do not make advances to women are apt to become victims to women who make advances to them.","One of the greatest pains to human nature is the pain of a new idea.","Poverty is an anomaly to rich people; it is very difficult to make out why people who want dinner do not ring the bell.","Public opinion is a permeating influence, and it exacts obedience to itself; it requires us to drink other men's thoughts, to speak other men's words, to follow other men's habits.","We must not let daylight in upon the magic.","Life is a school of probability.","An ambassador is not simply an agent; he is also a spectacle.","A constitutional statesman is in general a man of common opinions and uncommon abilities.","Writers like teeth are divided into incisors and grinders.","No great work has ever been produced except after a long interval of still and musing meditation.","It is good to be without vices, but it is not good to be without temptations.","The cure for admiring the House of Lords is to go and look at it.","The greatest mistake is trying to be more agreeable than you can be.","So long as there are earnest believers in the world, they will always wish to punish opinions, even if their judgment tells them it is unwise and their conscience that it is wrong.","The reason that there are so few good books written is that so few people who write know anything.","Woman absent is woman dead.","Honor sinks where commerce long prevails.","An inability to stay quiet is one of the conspicuous failings of mankind.","An influential member of parliament has not only to pay much money to become such, and to give time and labour, he has also to sacrifice his mind too - at least all the characteristics part of it that which is original and most his own.","The being without an opinion is so painful to human nature that most people will leap to a hasty opinion rather than undergo it.","Dullness in matters of government is a good sign, and not a bad one - in particular, dullness in parliamentary government is a test of its excellence, an indication of its success.","No real English gentleman, in his secret soul, was ever sorry for the death of a political economist.","Conquest is the missionary of valor, and the hard impact of military virtues beats meanness out of the world.","An element of exaggeration clings to the popular judgment: great vices are made greater, great virtues greater also; interesting incidents are made more interesting, softer legends more soft.","It is often said that men are ruled by their imaginations; but it would be truer to say they are governed by the weakness of their imaginations.","The whole history of civilization is strewn with creeds and institutions which were invaluable at first, and deadly afterwards.","A slight daily unconscious luxury is hardly ever wanting to the dwellers in civilization; like the gentle air of a genial climate, it is a perpetual minute enjoyment.","In every particular state of the world, those nations which are strongest tend to prevail over the others; and in certain marked peculiarities the strongest tend to be the best.","A severe though not unfriendly critic of our institutions said that the cure for admiring the House of Lords was to go and look at it.","The habit of common and continuous speech is a symptom of mental deficiency. It proceeds from not knowing what is going on in other people's minds.","All the best stories in the world are but one story in reality - the story of escape.

I've never been able to figure that out.","ABC had all these schlocky, bubblegum acts, and we had to come up with suitable material for them. In which we were amazingly unsuccessful.","I listen to a mixture of old jazz, contemporary, pop, some world beat stuff and various odds and ends.","I'm a self-taught musician aside from what I've been able to pick up from other players.","My primary influences were the best jazz players from the 50's and 60's and later some of the pop people from the same time period along with the better of the well known blues musicians.","'Deacon Blues' was special for me. It's the only time I remember mixing a record all day and, when the mix was done, feeling like I wanted to hear it over and over again. It was the comprehensive sound of the thing: the song itself, its character, the way the instruments sounded, and the way Tom Scott's tight horn arrangement fit in.","There was a film called 'FM,' and we were asked to do the title song. And I said, 'Does it have to have any specific words?' And they said, 'No, it just has to be about FM radio.' It took a day or two to write.","It seemed like the more complex the music we were playing, the less able we were to guarantee its consistency.","'8 Miles to Pancake Day' is a reconciliation of the classic space-time dilemma.","You have a kid, and it's like, 'He's gotta go to college! Gotta have some clothes!'","Cynicism, I contend, is the wailing of someone who believes that things are, or should be, or could be, much, much better than they are.","From a linguistic point of view, you can't really take much objection to the notion that a show is a show is a show.","I always look for the weirdest note to land on. I felt that that was the least I could do for the great musical traditions which I've spawned.","If there's a strange way to do something, I would certainly like to know about it. I feel that I owe that to my public.","All our wives are experimental psychologists.","We have been fortunate enough to do something that has always been out of the mainstream and yet have an audience for what we do.","There are some things that I write that I know are personal in a way, or the gag is so obscure that it's just for me, and there's other things that could basically be for anybody or be anything, at least until the lyrics start to get written.","I can never believe how much time and energy and money and talent and everything else is being poured into horrible ideas.","It's interesting how some songs really lend themselves to performance in a big public venue and performance by a band and so on, and so they're even more successful in that context than they were on the record.","Most of the time when people say something sounds like Steely Dan, and I listen to it, it doesn't. And I'm not even sure what they're talking about.","I learned a lot from the various artists I produced. Either you see them doing something that you do want to do it, or you see them doing something the way you don't want to do it.","Singing, for me, means singing as loud as I can.","We are constantly competing with the monsters from the id.","I think the audience for Limp Bizkit is probably not going to be particularly interested in what we're doing. I don't think they'll find much that satisfies them in what we do.","With any relationship that goes on and is productive over a long period, there have to be some sort of interlocking qualities in those personalities that make it possible to survive.","'Gaucho' was a struggle for us for a lot of reasons, and in the end, we just sort of survived it.","People are really exercised about one particular thing, and that is themselves. They will bore you endlessly with their broken hearts.","If any artist abuses his audience as a means to any end, noble or ignoble, he better have a damn good reason for it.","We opened for the Kinks, the Beach Boys, the Guess Who, Chuck Berry, Sha Na Na. We opened for Cheech and Chong - I opened for Cheech, and Don opened for Chong.","It's great fun to play with a really good band.","I thought Twitter was a joke. I really thought it was a gag. I thought it was like National Lampoon or the Onion.","I'm glad we turned into a big-time touring band later in life. In fact, it's almost like we planned it out that way.","In the '70s... there were rock players, and there were jazz players.","What gets people into trouble with records now is that they want to build something up without substantial musical ideas. Without that as a foundation, you can add all the layers of sound you want - it's still going to sound like a mess.","I love guys like Charlie Parker.","We fly to the town in the little private airplane, and then we have to get in cars and drive to the hotel and then drive to the gig. So, I want to do a tour where the performances will actually be at the small airports.","Given a choice between Charlie Mingus and Eric Dolphy or Joe Strummer and Lou Reed, there was no choice. I like Reed and Strummer, but it's kiddie music.","What about that Dave Brubeck live album, with a version of 'Like Someone in Love' on it, and long sax solos by Paul Desmond? That's what got me hooked on jazz.","Some places you play in America, it's like 'On the Waterfront.'","Let's face it, us '60s folks had pretty high expectations.","You can't always count on the devices, attitudes, and conceits that stood you in good stead in 1972 or 1973, or 1978-79, to still have the same impact all these years later.","We try to write things that work on a variety of levels at the same time: A sleek exterior with a turbulent lyric.","I think every time, before we do an album, we have a discussion where we sort of consider the idea of doing something radically different.","I think that there's the self-imposed pressure to come up with something that's good. For guys like us, that's much more important than any external pressure could really be.","We've been allowed to operate unmolested on the fringes of the music scene, really. That's where we enjoy it most.","I'm not interested in a rock/jazz fusion.","We play rock & roll, but we swing when we play. We want that ongoing flow, that lightness, that forward rush of jazz.","I learned music from a book on piano theory. I was only interested in knowing about chords. From that, and from the 'Harvard Dictionary of Music,' I learned everything I wanted to know.","Originally, we had a band known as Steely Dan. As we moved away from the band, we got whoever was appropriate for specific tunes. In a lot of cases, we gravitated toward jazz players who had more sophisticated harmonic concepts.","I guess actually playing on the records and touring is a great forced practice regimen for me. And you learn a lot playing with people.","The more of what our music does violates the premise of its format that it's presented in, the better. So, hearing our music in the supermarket, a Muzak version, is great.","It's good - it's great when somebody who is 20 years younger than you comes up and says, 'Wow, we just got turned on to you guys, and you're really great,' or something like that. I like that.","I don't think that the Grammys are in any way a just way of grading music.","It wouldn't bother me at all not to play on my own album.","It was the 'Gaucho' album that finished us off. We had pursued an idea beyond the point where it was practical. That album took about two years, and we were working on it all of that time - all these endless tracking sessions involving different musicians. It took forever, and it was a very painful process.","I spent a couple of years not doing any music or anything, just here in Hawaii trying to get healthy and adjust to the new regimen I was setting up for myself.","The perfect day for me is waking up and having a cup of tea with my kids before I drive them to school; Then, I go into the studio and try and write some music for three or four hours and give up about noon.","With 'Aja,' there was a sort of happy conjunction between our tastes and the backgrounds and styles of studio musicians at the time.","Most of our songs are about relationships.","There's a great freedom in writing by yourself. You can write anything you want.","When you're collaborating with somebody, there has to be a spirit of cooperation. There are a lot of times when you just can't persuade someone to write a certain type of song, either musically or lyrically.","There was a time in my life when one aspect of my lifestyle called for watching a lot of television.","When the first album came out and I heard 'Do It Again' on the radio, that was the greatest thing that had ever happened. After that, it was all downhill.","Our career had a sort of funny shape.","If it feels like we're re-creating something rather than creating something, we don't do it.","I think we're right up there with Herman's Hermits and the other greats. Maybe somewhere between Herman's Hermits and the Gershwins.","In the '70s, my playing was completely untutored, but it sounded good to me, and I tried to find ways to make those very simple things work in more ambitious contexts.","I don't particularly like L.A.","Going out and looking for managers is like going out and looking for rattlesnakes."],"Walter Benjamin":["The adjustment of reality to the masses and of the masses to reality is a process of unlimited scope, as much for thinking as for perception.","The construction of life is at present in the power of facts far more than convictions.","All human knowledge takes the form of interpretation.","Work on good prose has three steps: a musical stage when it is composed, an architectonic one when it is built, and a textile one when it is woven.","The greater the decrease in the social significance of an art form, the sharper the distinction between criticism and enjoyment by the public. The conventional is uncritically enjoyed, and the truly new is criticized with aversion.","Memory is not an instrument for exploring the past but its theatre. It is the medium of past experience, as the ground is the medium in which dead cities lie interred.","Death is the sanction of everything the story-teller can tell. He has borrowed his authority from death.","The art of the critic in a nutshell: to coin slogans without betraying ideas. The slogans of an inadequate criticism peddle ideas to fashion.","The destructive character lives from the feeling, not that life is worth living, but that suicide is not worth the trouble.","Every passion borders on the chaotic, but the collector's passion borders on the chaos of memories.","He who observes etiquette but objects to lying is like someone who dresses fashionably but wears no vest.","It is precisely the purpose of the public opinion generated by the press to make the public incapable of judging, to insinuate into it the attitude of someone irresponsible, uninformed.","Counsel woven into the fabric of real life is wisdom.","Boredom is the dream bird that hatches the egg of experience. A rustling in the leaves drives him away.","The camera introduces us to unconscious optics as does psychoanalysis to unconscious impulses.","The true picture of the past flits by. The past can be seized only as an image which flashes up at the instant when it can be recognized and is never seen again.","The idea that happiness could have a share in beauty would be too much of a good thing.","Genuine polemics approach a book as lovingly as a cannibal spices a baby.","To be happy is to be able to become aware of oneself without fright.","Opinions are to the vast apparatus of social existence what oil is to machines: one does not go up to a turbine and pour machine oil over it; one applies a little to hidden spindles and joints that one has to know.","Books and harlots have their quarrels in public.","All disgust is originally disgust at touching.","The only way of knowing a person is to love them without hope.","Of all the ways of acquiring books, writing them oneself is regarded as the most praiseworthy method. Writers are really people who write books not because they are poor, but because they are dissatisfied with the books which they could buy but do not like.","Gifts must affect the receiver to the point of shock.","It is only for the sake of those without hope that hope is given to us.","Opinions are a private matter. The public has an interest only in judgments.","Living substance conquers the frenzy of destruction only in the ecstasy of procreation.","The art of storytelling is reaching its end because the epic side of truth, wisdom, is dying out.","Quotations in my work are like wayside robbers who leap out armed and relieve the stroller of his conviction."],"Walter Brennan":["I never made a movie I would not take my family to see.","I'm not a glamour boy, and I never get the girl. I like to play old people, because there's something to them. Did you ever see anybody under 30 with any real character or expression in his face?"],"Walter Chrysler":["The real secret of success is enthusiasm.","I feel sorry for the person who can't get genuinely excited about his work. Not only will he never be satisfied, but he will never achieve anything worthwhile.","Every new development, highway, railroad, steamship line, building operation, whether it be a drainage project in old Greece or a new water system in Peru, means an added use of the automobile.","To me every hour of the day and night is an unspeakably perfect miracle.","I like to build things. I like to do things.","It devolves upon the United States to help to motorize the world."],"Walter Crane":["We want a vernacular in art. No mere verbal or formal agreement, or dead level of uniformity but that comprehensive and harmonizing unity with individual variety which can be developed among people politically and socially free.","I never saw anything more like real warfare in my life - only the attack was all on one side. The police, in spite of their numbers, apparently thought they could not cope with the crowd.","They had certainly exasperated them, and could not disperse them, as after every charge - and some of these drove the people right against the shutters in the shops in the Strand - they returned again."],"Walter Cronkite":["I covered the Vietnam War. I remember the lies that were told, the lives that were lost - and the shock when, twenty years after the war ended, former Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara admitted he knew it was a mistake all along.","Journalism is what we need to make democracy work.","In seeking truth you have to get both sides of a story.","We all have our likes and our dislikes. But... when we're doing news - when we're doing the front-page news, not the back page, not the op-ed pages, but when we're doing the daily news, covering politics - it is our duty to be sure that we do not permit our prejudices to show. That is simply basic journalism.","Objective journalism and an opinion column are about as similar as the Bible and Playboy magazine.","Grandfather was an old-fashioned pharmacist who never ceased venting his resentment at the growing number of retail items the drugstore had to carry, and he would go into periods of fearful rage when the subject of chain stores was raised.","I worry that we're not getting enough of the news that we need to make informed judgments as citizens.","We have overcome some terrible blows to our democracy, to the future of our democracy, to the future of our nation. We survived the Civil War and the strife that tore this nation apart.","The democratic system is challenged by the failure in television because our evening news programmes have gone for an attempt to entertain as much as to inform in the desperate fight for ratings.","I can't imagine a person becoming a success who doesn't give this game of life everything he's got.","Under the Constitution, giving 'aid and comfort' to a wartime enemy can lead to a charge of treason.","I have never voted a party line. I vote on the individual and the issues.","The civil rights fight was a very important fight.","America's health care system is neither healthy, caring, nor a system.","A liberal to me is one who - and it suits some of the dictionary definitions - is unbeholden to any specific belief or party or group or person, but makes up his or her mind on the basis of the facts and the presentation of those facts at the time. That defines what I am.","A journalist covering politics, most of us are aware of the necessity to try to be sure we're unbiased in our reporting. That's one of the fundamentals of good journalism.","Watergate just happened to come along at the same time as the demand for honesty in relations between the sexes, in advertising, in ecology, in almost everything. It just stumbled into that great big elephant trap that had already been built for it.","It seems to many of us that if we are to avoid the eventual catastrophic world conflict, we must strengthen the United Nations as a first step toward a world government patterned after our own government with a legislature, executive and judiciary, and police to enforce its international laws and keep the peace.","There is no such thing as a little freedom. Either you are all free, or you are not free.","When I stepped down from the evening news at the age of 65, in '81, things were still going well. Immediately after that, the whole tenor of the CBS News Department changed.","We are not educated well enough to perform the necessary act of intelligently selecting our leaders.","We the people have the strength to bring our country from our weak-kneed stumbling gait in the last ranks of reason to the leadership of the great march to environmental victory.","If, as they say, the threat of the hangman's noose has a powerful way of focusing one's attention, the same can be said of pregnancy.","I do think that the success, although still not complete... in the recognition of equal rights... to all Americans, regardless of color, creed and so forth, was also one of the best stories we've had to report.","In journalism, we recognize a kind of hierarchy of fame among the famous. We measure it in two ways: by the length of an obituary and by how far in advance it is prepared. Presidents, former presidents, and certain heads of state are at the top of the chain.","When you're bringing in a fairly unknown candidate challenging a sitting president, the population needs a lot more information than reduced coverage provides.","If every small nation with a border dispute believes they can go ahead and launch a pre-emptive war and that it will be approved by the greatest power, that is a very dangerous thing.","In the early stages of our involvement in Vietnam, basically I felt that our course was right. My concern grew with the concern of the American people.","I think cameras ought to be everywhere the reporters are allowed to go. I think, furthermore, reporters and cameras ought to be everywhere that the Constitution says the public can go.","I'm so tired of stories starting, 'Maud Jones was walking her dog down Broadway.' You've got to go over to the back page somewhere to finally find out the damn dog was run over by a truck. Get the thing told, for heaven's sake. Everybody doesn't have to be an O. Henry.","Everything is being compressed into tiny tablets. You take a little pill of news every day - 23 minutes - and that's supposed to be enough.","I think it is absolutely essential in a democracy to have competition in the media, a lot of competition, and we seem to be moving away from that.","There's a little more ego involved in these jobs than people might realize.","We need not only an executive to make international law, but we need the military forces to enforce that law and the judicial system to bring the criminals to justice before they have the opportunity to build military forces that use these horrid weapons that rogue nations and movements can get hold of - germs and atomic weapons.","I wanted to have more time to play and reflect, but I find retirement more stressful than having a nice, steady job because I have to make decisions about where I want to be.","I never took any elocution lessons, no diction lessons. I might have been a pretty decent broadcaster if I had, but what you see, I'm afraid, is what you get.","I simply told people what I thought about the state of the war in Vietnam, and it was that we better get out of this.","I've got a 12-year-old grandson who, when he was 3 years old, before he could say many other words, could name the different kinds of dinosaurs.","As anchorman of the CBS Evening News, I signed off my nightly broadcasts for nearly two decades with a simple statement: 'And that's the way it is.' To me, that encapsulates the newsman's highest ideal: to report the facts as he sees them, without regard for the consequences or controversy that may ensue.","With police wielding unprecedented powers to invade privacy, tap phones and conduct searches seemingly at random, our civil liberties are in a very precarious condition.","It's hard for us to really understand the immensity so far of the conquest of space.","The perils of duck hunting are great - especially for the duck.","There were a few youthful fishing trips, but I never enjoyed the experiences, partly because I didn't like hurting the bait.","History must share with reading, writing and arithmetic first rank as the most important subjects in the curriculum. Understanding the issues on which citizens of a republic are expected to vote is impossible without an understanding of the past.","And that's the way it is.","Dan Rather and I just aren't especially chummy.","The great sadness of my life is that I never achieved the hour newscast, which would not have been twice as good as the half-hour newscast, but many times as good.","I've gone from the most trusted man in America to one of the most debated.","Our job is only to hold up the mirror - to tell and show the public what has happened.","I think somebody ought to do a survey as to how many great, important men have quit to spend time with their families who spent any more time with their family.","I want to say that probably 24 hours after I told CBS that I was stepping down at my 65th birthday, I was already regretting it. And I regretted it every day since.","I learned early on that in the real world, the masks of tragedy and comedy adorn the proscenium of every life.","I never ceased to be surprised when southern whites, at their homes or clubs, told racial jokes and spoke so derogatorily of blacks while longtime servants, for whom they quite clearly had some affection, were well within earshot.","I take a certain pride in having maintained a reputation for fast copy throughout my newspaper career. Fast-breaking stories left my typewriter in a hurry. Not great literature, perhaps, but fast, and usually accurate.","I think we are realizing that we are going to have to have an international rule of law.","I wouldn't give up on the U.N. yet.","Give news a little more time, and don't request that they also, in their news time, entertain. We're not entertainers. We're journalists. And we need more time to do our job well.","I hope that, somewhere, Mom and Dad are proud that little Walter is performing with the Mormon Tabernacle Choir.","I haven't quite got the hang of this retirement thing.","With all this dolling up and featuring of the news, it's getter harder and harder just to get the facts of the story.","I had discovered journalism to be my life's ambition.","We have more and more one-newspaper towns, and that troubles me.","I think that the failure of newspaper competition in a community is a very serious handicap to the dissemination of the knowledge that the citizens need to participate in a democracy.","Part of the new morality of the '60s and '70s is a new attitude toward homosexuality. The homosexual men and women have organized to fight for acceptance and respectability.","Anchormen shouldn't cry.","The successful landing on the moon, very probably, is the best story.","I think there are a lot of good pieces that can be covered in 20 minutes that don't need an hour, but by the same token, there are things that need an hour or more.","I think it'd be great if the evening news broadcast, for instance, were unsponsored and unrated.","I record it here today to establish my early predisposition to editorial work - to be both pontifical and wrong.","Cable has come along; many all-news 24 hour cable outlets in the United States. They have cut deeply into the traditional networks' viewing audience.","The military people don't like it; the government probably doesn't like it, but the people should know what they're sending their young people into when they permit their governments to declare war and engage in war.","Perhaps if all the peoples of the world understand what war really means, we would eliminate it.","No, I don't think my generation got into this dinosaur thing.","Arianna Huffington has exercised her renowned wisdom to give journalism another boost along the ever busier Internet. Her blog site promises to be an interesting challenge for those of us lucky enough to be invited to participate with our occasional contributions.","I am joining the hundreds of thousands who shall be marching in the Virtual March on Washington to Stop Global Warming in order to demonstrate the concern that we all hold for the future of our planet and all the living things - flora, fauna, human and animal - that exist upon it.","I do not consider a liberal necessarily to be a leftist.","I think the whole policy of pre-emptive war is a serious, serious mistake.","I looked at the world with the humaneness, I think, which is one of the hallmarks of being liberal in my mind.","It's a little hard not to be an elitist when you're making millions of dollars a year.","I write pretty quickly. Write pretty fast. I was an old press service man. That was part of the necessity of that occupation.","For heaven's sakes, in the newspaper days, when we had competing newspapers, and the newsstands sale was as important as the circulation - as the agreed-upon circulation, whatever you call that - in those days, why, gosh, the sensationalism was tremendous.","I certainly think cameras ought to be in courtrooms.","Court proceedings, except for certain limited situations, are open to the public. This is for the protection of the accused, to be certain to ascertain that there is a fair trial.","I don't think it's in any way harmful, this marriage of media and politicians. I think it enhances the communications process considerably and makes it possible for the public to be far more aware, far more up-to-date on issues and the opposite sides of the issues.","The whole period of the '60s changed a lot of us; there was never a decade like that in American history... to have the decade capture one of the great accomplishments of this century: man landing on the moon.","I had as much time to prepare for that moon landing as NASA did, and I still was speechless when it happened. It just was so awe-inspiring to actually be able to see the thing through the television that was a miracle in itself.","I can swear on a stack of Bibles that not once in doing the 'CBS Evening News' for 19 years - well, I take it back. Once perhaps. But during 19 years, with perhaps one exception, was I ever aware of any political or commercial pressure on that broadcast whatsoever.","You think you would react one way when a situation develops and, and when the sharp shells are flying, you don't quite stand up like you think you might.","Advertising's always been a considerable pressure on publishers.","I think people make way too much of ratings.","I don't believe in these headline-hunting interviews. That's just not my style.","Maybe I'm just a slow learner or something, but I like to have things laid out as plainly and simply as possible.","I'm one of the best condensers in the business.","I guess taking a stand is valid for a commentator. But that's not what I am.","I am a news presenter, a news broadcaster, an anchorman, a managing editor - not a commentator or analyst.","I feel no compulsion to be a pundit. As a matter of fact, I really don't have that much to say about most things. Working with hard news satisfies me completely.","Sometimes a famous subject may even outlive his own obituary writer.","Beyond being timely, an obituary has a more subjective duty: to assess its subject's impact.","The death of Churchill at 90 was one of those watershed moments in which the obituary rises to a special calling beyond the sharing of remembered times. It gave an older generation a rare opportunity to explain something of itself to its children.","The very first time a politician puts you in his target is sometimes a disappointment, because perhaps you thought you were friends and getting along well... But it is not something that you dwelled on. At least, I did not.","I'm a liberal, but I'm not biased. Seriously.","Anybody who's spent thirteen or fourteen years in print journalism has a lot of stories he thinks were inwardly satisfying as far as preparation, understanding, and diligence.","I suppose popularity is measured by ratings. If a broadcaster is known as the leader because of ratings, then that's where people most want to be seen and heard, so there's no question that there's an advantage.","I can't go into a mob scene and sense the mood and the attitude of the crowd. I can't conduct man-on-the-street interviews or even get reactions that I can be sure are honest, because they know who I am.","A lot of the questions raised about television's power and influence on events have applied throughout history to every mass-communications medium - most particularly print, because that's the medium we've had the longest.","There's no story that breaks, including a five-alarm fire in Brooklyn, that I don't wish I were covering.","I think that our comfort is in our history.","Helping set the day's agenda and deciding what we used and editing it, that was a journalistic high point. I liked reporting as well. Just doing the news - the live performance - wasn't important. Working on the desk was.","I miss particularly the managing editor role on the 'Evening News.'","All through my life, I have never disguised my sentiments about politics in general.","On television, I tried to absolutely hew to the middle of the road and not show any prejudice or bias in any way.","I did not believe that the public was sophisticated enough to understand that a newsman could wear several hats and that we had the ability to turn off - nearly, you can't say perfectly, but nearly - all of our prejudices and biases.","It's always hard, after you've been in command, to take a lesser role."],"Walter Dean Myers":["One of the lessons learned during the Vietnam War was that the depiction of wounded soldiers, of coffins stacked higher than their living guards, had a negative effect on the viewing public. The military in Iraq specifically banned the photographing of wounded soldiers and coffins, thus sanitizing this terrible and bloody conflict.","I was teased if I brought my books home. I would take a paper bag to the library and put the books in the bag and bring them home. Not that I was that concerned about them teasing me - because I would hit them in a heartbeat. But I felt a little ashamed, having books.","I joined the army on my seventeenth birthday, full of the romance of war after having read a lot of World War I British poetry and having seen a lot of post-World War II films. I thought the romantic presentations of war influenced my joining and my presentation of war to my younger siblings.","I know what falling off the cliff means. I know from being considered a very bright kid to being considered like a moron and dropping out of school.","I talk to myself out loud at times, and feel embarrassed when people overhear me.","I think it's difficult for young people to acknowledge being smart, to knowledge being a reader. I see kids who are embarrassed to read books. They're embarrassed to have people see them doing it.","We need to tell kids flat out: reading is not optional.","Fifty percent of all meaningful education takes place in the home. What do you share with your child? You share your interests. I was a book person. I read with my son. My wife is an artist. She dragged his little butt around to museums. He's an illustrator of children's books.","To fight for one's country, to offer one's very life to promote the well being of the United States, is truly a noble undertaking. But so is the vigilance of the citizen who carefully examines our leaders to see if political problems are being solved by wars simply because this seems to be the easiest solution.","I began going to juvenile prisons. And some of these kids face some very, very tough lives. How do they handle these lives? Do they even know that if their life is bad, that they're still OK? Do they know that? Do they know that someone is thinking the same way that they're thinking?","We need to tell young people that America was built by men and women of all colors and that the future of this country is dependent on the participation of all of our citizens.","I keep threatening to keep a formal journal, but whenever I start one it instantly becomes an exercise in self-consciousness. Instead of a journal I manage to have dozens of notebooks with bits and pieces of stories, poems, and notes. Almost every thing I do has its beginning in a notebook of some sort, usually written on a bus or train.","I remember one time being told I could not play in a basketball game at the College of William and Mary because I was black, even though I was playing with a United States Army team.","The most difficult idea to reconcile in war is the notion that anything is going to be solved by killing a stranger, or in risking your life for a cause anchored in some distant political arena.","I was raised in Harlem. I never found a book that took place in Harlem. I never had a church like mine in a book. I never had people like the people I knew. People who could not find their lives in books and celebrated felt bad about themselves. I needed to write to include the lives of these young people.","With my writing, what I want to do is humanize the young people I write about.","After so many books and so many years of writing, I have a good idea of my strengths and weaknesses. I love the process of writing and, if I allowed myself, I would write far too much every day. One weakness which I've struggled to overcome is my tendency to having my characters ruminate for pages.","And I see the - you know, when I go to the juvenile detention centers and prisons, I see people who can't read now. And I know that when they leave those prisons and those detention centers, they're not going to be able to make it in our society.","As a writer, I absorb stories, allow them to churn within my own head and heart - often for years - until I find a way of telling them that fits both my time and temperament.","I like people who take responsibility for their lives.","Children have adopted a consumerist attitude - I dare you to entertain me.","So many organizations have a mentoring arm, but they don't really do it. Their idea of mentoring a kid is giving them general advice. But what they need to do is read with children.","Growing up in Harlem, I had the chance to practice with a Negro League team. At fifteen, I was over six feet tall and a fair athlete, but my skills didn't come close to some of the players I saw.","Like the Negro League players, I traveled through the segregated south as a young man. Because I was black, I was denied service at many restaurants and could only drink from water fountains marked 'Colored.' When I went to the movies, I would have to sit in the Colored balcony.","From my foster parents, the Deans, I received the love that was ultimately to strengthen me, even when I had forgotten its source. It was my foster mother, a half-Indian, half-German woman, who taught me to read, though she herself was barely literate. I remember her reading to me every day from 'True Romance' magazine.","I was a good student, but a speech impediment was causing problems. One of my teachers decided that I couldn't pronounce certain words at all. She thought that if I wrote something, I would use words I could pronounce. I began writing little poems. I began to write short stories, too.","I came to Harlem from West Virginia when I was three, after my mother died. My father, who was very poor, gave me up to two wonderful people, my foster parents.","I wrote for magazines. I wrote adventure stuff, I wrote for the 'National Enquirer,' I wrote advertising copy for cemeteries.","I had seen the ballet of 'Swan Lake' as a child but it was as an adult, when I saw a production featuring Erik Bruhn, that I first noticed how significant a part the ever-present threat of violence played. This juxtaposition of great beauty and grace with a backdrop of pure evil stayed with me for years.","As a child I wanted to be a professional athlete or lawyer.","New York is my favorite city.","I write in a small office at home.","I would enjoy having dinner with the poet/playwright Derek Walcott.","I think that what we need to do is say, 'Reading is going to really affect your life.' You take a black man who doesn't have a job, but you say to him, 'Look, you can make a difference in your child's life, just by reading to him for 30 minutes a day.' That's what I would like to do.","People still try to sell books that way - as 'books can take you to foreign lands.' We've given children this idea that reading and books are a nice option, if you want that kind of thing. I hope we can get over that idea.","I live intimately with my characters before starting a book. I cut out pictures of them for my wall. I do time lines for each major character and a time line for the entire novel: What is going on in the world as my characters struggle with their problems?","There is a crisis involving reading in certain communities.","We all know we should eat right and we should exercise, but reading is treated as if it's this wonderful adjunct.","I couldn't speak well. I went to speech therapy for 10 years. And I was sort of frustrated in that sense.","I didn't even know for years that people ever even got paid for this, because they don't teach you that in school. They don't say Shakespeare got a check.","Thinking back to boyhood days, I remember the bright sun on Harlem streets, the easy rhythms of black and brown bodies, the sounds of children streaming in and out of red brick tenements.","I read a lot of comic books and any kind of thing I could find. One day, a teacher found me. She grabbed my comic book and tore it up. I was really upset, but then she brought in a pile of books from her own library. That was the best thing that ever happened to me.","My younger brother's death in Vietnam was both sobering and cause for reflection. In 'Fallen Angels' I wanted to dispel the notion of war as either romantic or simplistically heroic.","I want young people to be hesitant to glorify war and to demand of their leaders justification for the sacrifices they ask of our citizens.","If what I read doesn't reflect my life - whether I'm gay or Latino or on welfare - doesn't that really mean that my life is not valuable?","When my family fell apart, it was such a troubled part of my life... I think I could understand what I was going through, but I didn't have the vocabulary for it.","I'll never live to write all the stories I have in my head.","Within the black community, roughly 60 percent of children are born to single moms. Moms don't have the emotional wherewithal to deal with their children. Their English is atrocious. Their speaking is atrocious. The dropout rate is horrendous.","As a young man, I saw families prosper without reading because there were always sufficient opportunities for willing workers who could follow simple instructions. This is no longer the case. Children who don't read are, in the main, destined for lesser lives. I feel a deep sense of responsibility to change this.","There were two very distinct voices going on in my head and I moved easily between them. One had to do with sports, street life and establishing myself as a male... The other voice, the one I had from my street friends and teammates, was increasingly dealing with the vocabulary of literature.","There was a time I was no longer going to be black. I was going to be an 'intellectual.' When I was first looking around for colleges, thinking of colleges I couldn't afford to go to, I was thinking of being a philosopher. I began to understand then that much of my feelings about race were negative.","My dad was a janitor for U.S. Radium Corporation, and he stayed there for 37 years. So he didn't read.","One of the problems is that kids who don't read - who are not doing well in school - they know they're not doing well. And they want everyone to be in that same category.","Now, my mom did not read well and she read 'True Romance' magazines, but she read with me. And she would spend 30 minutes a day, her finger going along the page, and I learned to read. Eventually, by the time I was four and a half, she could iron and I could sit there and read the 'True Romance.' And that was wonderful.","When we think of war, the tendency is to picture young soldiers only in their military roles. To a large extent this dehumanizes the soldiers and makes it easier for society to commit them to combat.","As a kid I didn't see black cowboys on the screen. What that said to me was that there were things I couldn't do or be because of my color. What we see others like us do gives us permission to expand our own horizons.","I admired the work ethic of the cowboys I read about. The idea of these young people taking on this much responsibility was impressive. I would like modern readers to have an appreciation of this.","There have been two areas identified as being vital to reading - and that's for very young children between the ages of one month and five years and for teenagers. I've been trying to find ways of approaching both groups.","I am very much interested in getting parents to read to children, and trying to get people mentoring children. If I can do both I'll be happy.","I don't want to approach reading from the viewpoint of that it's a pleasant adjunct to your life. I want to approach it from the idea that you have to read or you're going to suffer. There's a difference to be made - and you can make it if you read with your child.","What I found fascinating was just how quickly the best of the young Negro League players were drafted into the major leagues once Branch Rickey broke the color line by hiring Jackie Robinson. It was clear that all of the major league owners already knew the talents of the black ballplayers that they had refused to let into their league.","Each generation seems to invent its own reasons for war.","America believes what's good for us is good for the world. It's very difficult to understand that that's not necessarily true."],"Walter Duranty":["The problem with most people is that they think with their hopes or fears or wishes rather than their minds.","Must all of them and their families be physically abolished? Of course not? They must be 'liquidated' or melted in the hot fire of exile and labor into the proletarian masses."],"Walter Elliot":["Perseverance is not a long race; it is many short races one after the other.","The desert has its holiness of silence, the crowd its holiness of conversation."],"Walter F. Mondale":["If you are sure you understand everything that is going on, you are hopelessly confused.","I don't want to spend the next two years in Holiday Inns.","Do you want to tear your life apart and get rid of everything you've known as a lifestyle? Like seeing your family? Being with your friends? A fishing trip? A hunting trip? A night's sleep?","I said I didn't want to spend most of my life in Holidays Inns, but I've checked and they've all been redecorated. They're marvelous places to stay and I've thought it over and that's where I'd like to be.","In our system, at about 11:30 on election night, they just push you off the edge of the cliff-and that's it. You might scream on the way down, but you're going to hit the bottom, and you're not going to be in elective office.","What do we want our kids to do? Sweep up around Japanese computers?","Modern politics today requires a mastery of television. I've never really warmed up to television and, in fairness to television, it's never warmed up to me.","Running for President is physically, emotionally, mentally and spiritually the most demanding single undertaking I can envisage unless it's World War III."],"Walter F. Ulmer":["We've got some very good things to do without screwing around with sleeves.","The essence of a general's job is to assist in developing a clear sense of purpose to keep the junk from getting in the way of important things."],"Walter Gilbert":["I have the same sense of the power and virtue of knowledge that some people get from a religious background.","Biology will relate every human gene to the genes of other animals and bacteria, to this great chain of being.","The virtues of science are skepticism and independence of thought.","The interaction of the variation in our genes is what's responsible for lots of our attributes and vigor.","By asking a novel question that you don't know the answer to, you discover whether you can formulate a way of finding the answer, and you stretch your own mind, and very often you learn something new.","Early on, it's good to develop the ability to write. Learning to write is a useful exercise, even if what you're writing about is not that relevant.","Everyone wants a hand in the outcome, a piece of the knowledge.","In 15 years we'll have all the sequence, a list of the genes everyone has in common and those that differ among people. We know only something like a tenth of 1 percent of the sequence at the moment.","It's easier to change what you do than people think it is. If you don't change, your field changes around you.","Science doesn't in the slightest depend on trust. It depends completely on the belief that you can demonstrate something for yourself.","Scientists tend to be skeptical, but the weakness of the community of science is that it tends to move into preformed establishment modes that say this is the only way of doing science, the only valid view.","The best project is one that asks a novel question.","The human's place in the universe will be set in the scheme of evolution, the product of our biological inheritance.","Today we try to identify a gene and then study its properties.","We are embedded in a biological world and related to the organisms around us.","We haven't been able yet to determine in terms of genes what makes a human being a human and not another mammal.","We know specific genes are turned on in specific cells, but we don't know to what extent this happens.","Why do we do basic research? To learn about ourselves."],"Walter Gropius":["Together let us desire, conceive, and create the new structure of the future, which will embrace architecture and sculpture and painting in one unity and which will one day rise toward Heaven from the hands of a million workers like the crystal symbol of a new faith.","The ultimate aim of all creative activity is the building!","Under trees, the urban dweller might restore his troubled soul and find the blessing of a creative pause.","Let us together create the new building of the future, which will be everything in one form: architecture and sculpture and painting.","The Bauhaus strives to bring together all creative effort into one whole, to reunify all the disciplines of practical art - sculpture, painting, handicrafts, and crafts - as inseparable components of a new architecture.","I am livid with rage, sitting here in chains through this mad war which kills any meaning of life... My nerves are shattered and my mind darkened.","Wherever I go I make others feel good, and by doing this, I create life. I am a sting, and a dangerous instrument!","Architecture begins where engineering ends.","Good architecture should be a projection of life itself, and that implies an intimate knowledge of biological, social, technical, and artistic problems.","Proficiency in a craft is essential to every artist. Therein lies the prime source of creative imagination. Let us then create a new guild of craftsmen without the class distinctions that raise an arrogant barrier between craftsman and artist!","Our guiding principle was that design is neither an intellectual nor a material affair, but simply an integral part of the stuff of life, necessary for everyone in a civilized society.","The ultimate, if distant, aim of the Bauhaus is the unified work of art - the great structure - in which there is no distinction between monumental and decorative art.","Only work which is the product of inner compulsion can have spiritual meaning.","Architects, sculptors painters, we all must return to the crafts! For art is not a 'profession.' There is no essential difference between the artist and the craftsman. The artist is an exalted craftsman.","The greatest responsibility of the planner and architect, I believe, is the protection and development of our habitat.","Today the arts exist in isolation, from which they can be rescued only through the conscious, cooperative effort of all craftsmen. Architects, painters, and sculptors must recognize anew and learn to grasp the composite character of a building both as an entity and in its separate parts.","The fear that individuality will be crushed out by the growing 'tyranny' of standardization is the sort of myth which cannot withstand the briefest examination.","Specialists are people who always repeat the same mistakes.","New synthetic substances - steel, concrete, glass - are actively superseding the traditional raw materials of construction.","My sole aim is to leave everything in suspension, in flux, in order to avoid our community solidifying into a conventional academy. Our initial resources may be few, but our spirits are high, receptive, and excited, and that seems to me to be the most important thing right now.","The problem of the minimum dwelling is that of establishing the elementary minimum of space, air, light, and heat required by man in order that he be able to fully develop his life functions without experiencing limitations due to his dwelling, i.e. a minimum modus vivendi in place of a modus non moriendi.","In all great epochs of history, the existence of standards - that is, the conscious adoption of type-forms - has been the criterion of a polite, well-ordered society; for it is a commonplace that repetition of the same things for the same purpose exercises a settling and civilizing influence on men's minds.","If your contribution has been vital there will always be somebody to pick up where you left off, and that will be your claim to immortality.","Man has evolved a mutual relationship with nature on earth, but his power to change its surface has grown so tremendously that this may become a curse instead of a blessing.","The development of the New Architecture encountered serious obstacles at a very early stage of its development. Conflicting theories and the dogmas enunciated in architects' personal manifestos all helped to confuse the main issue.","One of the outstanding achievements of the new constructional technique has been the abolition of the separating function of the wall.","The school is the servant of the workshop and will one day be absorbed in it. Therefore there will be no teachers or pupils in the Bauhaus but masters, journeymen, and apprentices.","With but a few exceptions, we don't have this personal study under masters any more. Craftsmanship has sunk very low. We no longer have any universally creative persons who are able to guide young learners not only in technical matters but also, at the same time, in a formal way.","We are in the midst of a momentous catastrophe of world history, of a transformation of all aspects of life and of the entire inner human being This is perhaps fortunate for the artistic person, if he is strong enough to bear the consequences, because what we need is the courage to have inner experience.","The strong desire to include every vital component of life instead of excluding part of them for the sake of too narrow and dogmatic an approach has characterized my whole life.","The mere drawing and painting world of the pattern designer and the applied artist must become a world that builds again.","Capitalism and power politics have made our generation creatively sluggish, and our vital art is mired in a broad bourgeois philistinism.","The utilization of flat roofs as 'grounds' offers us a means of re-acclimatizing nature amidst the stony deserts of our great towns; for the plots from which she has been evicted to make room for buildings can be given back to her up aloft.","The general public, formerly profoundly indifferent to everything to do with building, has been shaken out of its torpor; personal interest in architecture as something that concerns every one of us in our daily lives has been very widely aroused; and the broad line of its future development are already clearly discernible.","Our fresh technical resources have furthered the disintegration of solid masses of masonry into slender piers, with consequent far-reaching economies in bulk, space, weight, and haulage.","I cannot imagine myself fitting into the existing curriculum. I am too self-willed for that and have had my own very definite ideas for a long time, very different from the existing ways, as to how architecture is to be taught.","I feel very German - and who can make himself a judge over what is German and what is not - in my ideas and the ideas of my spiritual brothers of German origin.","As there is in Germany - as well as in Russia and Italy - no art which is not approved of by the government, any criticizing remark about the present policy made by me would easily be taken as a hostile act. I cannot have my name put up against an official report from Germany without risking very unpleasant consequences.","We must forget the prewar time, which was totally different. The sooner we adjust ourselves to the new, changed world, to its new, albeit harsh, beauties, the sooner will each individual be able to find his own personal happiness. The distress of Germany will spiritualize and deepen us.","Theo van Doesburg wanted to teach in the Bauhaus in 1922. I refused, however, to appoint him since I considered him to be too aggressive and too rigidly theoretical: he would have wrought havoc in the Bauhaus through his fanatic attitude, which ran counter to my own broader approach.","The days of the painter at the Bauhaus appear to be truly over. They are estranged from the actual core of present activities, and their influence is more restricting than inspiring.","If we investigate the vague feelings of the average man towards the arts, we find that he is timid and that he has developed a humble belief that art is something which has been invented centuries ago in countries like Greece or Italy and that all we can do about it is study it carefully and apply it.","Each person feels that he is an 'expert' in one or two fields and just the 'public' in all the others. But you know, probably, from experience that no one is really able to appreciate any display of ability in any field if he himself has not, to a certain degree, taken part in its problems and difficulties at some time.","The intellectual bourgeois of the old Empire - tepid and unimaginative, mentally slow, arrogant, and incorrectly trained - has proven his incapacity to be the bearer of German culture. His benumbed world is now toppled, its spirit is overthrown, and is in the midst of being recast into a new mold.","Overwhelmed by the miraculous potentialities of the machine, our human greed has interfered with the biological cycle of human companionship which keeps the life of a community healthy."],"Walter Hagen":["You're only here for a short visit. Don't hurry, don't worry. And be sure to smell the flowers along the way.","I never wanted to be a millionaire. I just wanted to live like one.","No one remembers who came in second.","It pleased the public to think I lived the easy, carefree life - the playboy of golf.","Make the hard ones look easy and the easy ones look hard.","My dear, did you ever stop to think what a wonderful bunker you would make?","It is the addition of strangeness to beauty that constitutes the romantic character in art.","There is no tragedy in missing a putt, no matter how short. All have erred in this respect."],"Walter Hill":["Well, we're in show business, and I have been making a living in this business a long time and inevitably it means taking what it is that you've done and hopefully you're showing it to a lot of people who like it.","It's really about, oh come on, this guy wouldn't say that or he wouldn't do that, you know, it's about the characters, about the story, about the situation.","I never do, I don't even go to the retrospectives.","I don't much like looking back.","I'll talk about these things, but it's just, you know, you only get so much time and I'm much more interested in what I'm going to be doing next year than in something I did 10 years ago.","Somebody once said, you have to wait 20 years before you can tell if a movie's any good or not so that's probably true.","Well, I'm about to do another western, a pilot for HBO this fall.","I think it's fair to say I've always been a boxing fan.","I've always wanted to do a boxing movie.","Some say Hollywood movies that are made about boxing are just metaphors for other things, I think I've made one that's actually about boxing and not a metaphor.","Naturally we need black men to give this movie serious credibility.","I always say the next one is my favorite.","I tend not to look back. It's confusing.","You as an audience can look at these things as films, but I remember them as social experiences.","I guess I never had a better experience than working on The Long Riders, and at the same time, I never had a harder time than what I did making Southern Comfort.","If I could go back I might change Geronimo a bit. If I do, it will be made a longer version.","I get a great high from writing.","I wouldn't not want to be a director and write as I wouldn't not to want to be a writer and direct movies.","I did have an offer to direct one of the Alien movies but I wasn't too excited about all the effects work.","I mean no film is beyond criticism, but I think we've made a very modest movie.","Get Miramax to send me down to Australia. I'd like to see it."],"Walter Huston":["Hell, I ain't paid to make good lines sound good. I'm paid to make bad lines sound good.","Many years ago... many, many years ago, I brought up a boy, and I said to him, 'Son, if you ever become a writer, try to write a good part for your old man sometime.' Well, by cracky, that's what he did!","I was certainly a better actor after my five years in Hollywood. I had learned to be natural - never to exaggerate. I found I could act on the stage in just the same way as I had acted in a studio: using my ordinary voice, eliminating gestures, keeping everything extremely simple.","Son, give 'em a good show, and always travel first class."],"Walter Isaacson":["Just being the seeker, somebody whose open to spiritual enlightenment, is in itself the important thing and it's the reward for being a seeker in this world.","I think one problem we've had is that people who are smart and creative and innovative as engineers went into financial engineering.","Smart people are a dime a dozen. What matters is the ability to think different... to think out of the box.","More generally, I made an effort to leave out things that weren't relevant to the main narrative themes of the book, namely that there were two sides to Steve Jobs: the romantic, poetic, countercultural rebel on one side, and the serious businessperson on the other.","I think right now we need to look back at the founding values of our country. Rise above partisanship, be less bitter when it comes to important matters that have to be solved.","I think that we shouldn't be fixated all the time on the ups and downs of the weekly ratings, of the quarter-hour ratings.","Yeah, I think that his great creation was not any one product but a company in which creativity was connected to great engineering. And that will survive at least while the current people who trained under Steve are there.","I think that Benjamin Franklin felt very strongly in foreign policy in this world, that you needed to at least show some humility, especially when you were strong.","I think when you're looking for people to interview, you want to make it fair and honest. You're not just bringing people on so you can beat them up or, you know, make fools out of them or something.","I've asked Jobs why he didn't get an operation then and he said, 'I didn't want my body to be opened. I didn't want to be violated in that way.'","I think it's really good that you have great competition among news networks, and for that matter all the networks in general. It's bringing more and more people in to watching the news.","But the point is to get a whole new generation of people and people in general more re-engaged in news, and this has happened a lot since September 11th of course.","We have to compete in a universe of 200 networks, so we have to carve out our own niche, and to me, that niche is just basic shoe-leather journalism with some good journalists at the helm you can trust as presenters.","Especially right after 9/11. Especially when the war in Afghanistan is going on. There was a real sense that you don't get that critical of a government that's leading us in war time.","I don't think there was enough skepticism because I think most of us kind of believed that Saddam Hussein was building biological, chemical, and perhaps even, nuclear weapons.","I actually think Bill Gates is conventionally smarter, even though it's a dumb word, but mental processing power - I've watched him use four different screens, process information, get to the right answer, boom boom boom.","For some people, miracles serve as evidence of God's existence.","Steve Jobs was never going to let Flash on any Apple product again like that after in 1997 - he's got a long memory - they said no and Bill Gates said yes.","In the age of the internet when everybody's a pundit, we're still gonna need somebody there to go talk to the colonels, to be on the ground in Baghdad and stuff and that's very expensive.","I think it is valuable and should be valued by its consumers. Charging for content forces discipline on journalists: they must produce things that people actually value.","And if you don't have your ears open, you're not going to be able to figure out what you should be doing.","I have a strong emotional respect for Steve.","You can't have a sustainable US economy without a great education system. Teach students to do the job right. You don't have an innovative economy unless you have a great education.","I've always had an abundance of material about the subjects of my biographies.","We are in a situation with the huge stimulus package that's going to be spent all across this nation and a big financial crisis and banking crisis. And what we need is good, trained journalists who can play the role of watchdog.","He said, 'From then on, I realized that I was not just abandoned. I was chosen. I was special.' And I think that's the key to understanding Steve Jobs.","I visited Jobs for the last time in his Palo Alto, Calif., home. He had moved to a downstairs bedroom because he was too weak to go up and down stairs. He was curled up in some pain, but his mind was still sharp and his humor vibrant.","When there are multiple versions of a story, you really have three ways to go. You can pick the most sensational version. You can try to balance things in your gut to get to what you think is the honest truth. Or you can err on the side of kindness.","What Einstein was able to do was - to use a cliche - think out of the box.","I think it's very important to have a sense of balance in covering the war, but you don't have to be morally neutral about terrorism.","Terrorism is a horrible thing that is the great threat to civilization on our planet.","One of the great pressures we're facing in journalism now is it's a lot cheaper to hire thumb suckers and pundits and have talk shows on the air than actually have bureaus and reporters.","I think when money starts to corrupt journalism, it undermines the journalism, and it undermines the credibility of the product, and you end up not succeeding.","You know, one of these things that happened in the '60s and '70s was this confluence of, sort of, a counter-culture with computer culture.","I do think it's important, if you're going to be very creative, to be a seeker.","When you write biographies, whether it's about Ben Franklin or Einstein, you discover something amazing: They are human.","Jobs has within him sort of this conflict, but he doesn't quite see it as a conflict between being hippie-ish and anti-materialistic but wanting to sell things like Wozniak's board. Wanting to create a business.","I think that's exactly what Silicon Valley was all about in those days. Let's do a startup in our parents' garage and try to create a business.","Polite and velvety leaders, who take care to avoid bruising others, are generally not as effective at forcing change.","I wonder now how tough you have to be to get big things done."],"Walter Johnson":["I throw as hard as I can when I think I have to throw as hard as I can.","Can I throw harder than Joe Wood? Listen mister, no man alive can throw any harder than Smokey Joe Wood.","You can't hit what you can't see."],"Walter Jon Williams":["I'm not afraid of werewolves or vampires or haunted hotels, I'm afraid of what real human beings to do other real human beings.","I wanted to be an author for as long as I can remember.","If you can find collaborators whose strengths compliment your own, the result can be more than the sum of its authors.","Science fiction readers probably have the gene for novelty, and seem to enjoy a cascade of invention as much as a writer enjoys providing one.","Genre labels are useful only insofar as they help you find an audience.","I was pretty much grown-up by the time I attended school in Britain - or as grown-up as I'll ever get.","The Internet offers an interesting combination of advertising and community by participating in the community you can become an advertisement for yourself.","An SF author who reads only SF will have little new to contribute, but someone with a broader experience will bring more to the table.","Being a writer was never a choice, it was an irresistible compulsion.","I now have to find a reason to write, every single day.","Now I have to motivate myself much more than I had previously.","For every SF reader of that period, Robert A. Heinlein was also a touchstone.","I went to college, though I didn't take many writing courses.","I found college useful for a lot of other reasons. It exposed me to a great many influences I wouldn't otherwise have encountered, and gave me a lot of time with some very intelligent people whose thoughts are still with me.","When state and religion are one, religion becomes a means for the powerful to remain in power.","How long it takes to write a book depends on its length.","The Rift, which was well over a thousand pages of manuscript, took two years.","I've experienced writer's block, but never for more than a few days.","I've learned that I get blocked when my subconscious mind is telling me that I've taken the work in a wrong direction, and that once I start listening to what my subconscious is trying to tell me, I can work out the problem and get moving again.","It's a tough job to tell a story when the audience already knows the ending, and the ending is bleak.","I can't speak for the other authors, but what I hoped to achieve was to illuminate certain corners of the Lucas universe that hadn't yet been explored.","Even if you only want to write science fiction, you should also read mysteries, poetry, mainstream literature, history, biography, philosophy, and science.","Everything that you read is an influence on everything you write, and you want to draw as many elements into your work as you can.","Try to meet as many authors, agents, and editors as you can.","I'm in favor of any technology that makes my work available to the reading public at a reasonable price.","The mass-market paperback, for one, is too expensive.","I want a platform that, like a book or a magazine, I can carry into the bath or leave at the beach.","That's why editors and publishers will never be obsolete: a reader wants someone with taste and authority to point them in the direction of the good stuff, and to keep the awful stuff away from their door.","It's hard to generalize, because they're all different. When I started, I decided to take as much advantage as I could of the freedom offered by the SF field.","The big battle at the end of DW isn't drawn from history, but it's influenced by history, certainly.","Working within the limitations of the shared world generally made the writing easier, because I didn't have to invent any of the characters or background, which is usually the hardest part.","Some of my ideas were shot down by Lucasfilm because they stepped on territory that has been reserved for the movies. I didn't have a problem with that."],"Walter Kaufmann":["The great artist is the man who most obviously succeeds in turning his pains to advantage, in letting suffering deepens his understanding and sensibility, in growing through his pains.","In all three cases, and for most human beings, the problem of suffering poses no difficult problem at all: one has a world picture in which suffering has its place, a world picture that takes suffering into account.","Life ceases to be so oppressive: we are free to give our own lives meaning and purpose, free to redeem our suffering by making something of it.","To try to fashion something from suffering, to relish our triumphs, and to endure defeats without resentment: all that is compatible with the faith of a heretic.","The first function of a book review should be, I believe, to give some idea of the contents and character of the book.","The problem of suffering is: why is there the suffering we know?","Thirdly, even if we assume that the world is governed by purpose, we need only add that this purpose - or, if there are several, at least one of them - is not especially intent on preventing suffering, whether it is indifferent to suffering or actually rejoices in it.","Here an attempt is made to explain suffering: the outcaste of traditional Hinduism is held to deserve his fetched fate; it is a punishment for the wrongs he did in a previous life.","It is widely assumed, contrary to fact, that theism necessarily involves the two assumptions which cannot be squared with the existence of so much suffering, and that therefore, per impossibile, they simply have to be squared with the existence of all this suffering, somehow.","The doctrine of original sin claims that all men sinned in Adam; but whether they did or whether it is merely a fact that all men sin does not basically affect the problem of suffering.","It does not follow that the meaning must be given from above; that life and suffering must come neatly labeled; that nothing is worth while if the world is not governed by a purpose.","Job's forthright indictment of the injustice of this world is surely right. The ways of the world are weird and much more unpredictable than either scientists or theologians generally make things look.","Those who believe in God because their experience of life and the facts of nature prove his existence must have led sheltered lives and closed their hearts to the voice of their brothers' blood.","The deepest difference between religions is not that between polytheism and monotheism.","The only theism worthy of our respect believes in God not because of the way the world is made but in spite of that. The only theism that is no less profound than the Buddha's atheism is that represented in the Bible by Job and Jeremiah.","It was also Hegel who established the view that the different philosophic systems that we find in history are to be comprehended in terms of development and that they are generally one-sided because they owe their origins to a reaction against what has gone before.","When Hegel later became a man of influence' he insisted that the Jews should be granted equal rights because civic rights belong to man because he is a man and not on account of his ethnic origins or his religion.","Faith means intense, usually confident, belief that is not based on evidence sufficient to command assent from every reasonable person."],"Walter Kerr":["Half the world is composed of idiots, the other half of people clever enough to take indecent advantage of them.","It has an air about it of having strolled in from the street with a few tricks up its sleeve, and if everybody would relax, please, it would do its best to pass the time whimsically.","Harpo Marx looks like a musical comedy.","He had delusions of adequacy."],"Walter Kirn":["I love reference books, especially collections of memorable quotations, world almanacs, and atlases. Facts to me are like candy or popcorn, small, tasty delights, and I like to gorge on them now and then.","Novelists who pretend to understand what keeps them scribbling are really just guessing. A profound, unmet childish need to be acknowledged? Maybe. It hardly matters, though. The termite that asks itself why it keeps chewing risks becoming sluggish and inefficient, as does the writer who grows self-conscious in the middle of chapter five.","Thanks to Twitter, iPads, BlackBerrys, voice-activated in-dash navigation systems, and a hundred other technologies that offer distraction anywhere, anytime, boredom has loosened its grip on us at last - that once-crushing 'weight' has become, for the most part, a memory.","A true nature is a gloomy monolith, sort of like that old black rotary phone that I had to sing 'Happy Birthday' to Grandpa on. But novelists, damn us, still need true natures - so we can give them to our protagonists. And so readers can vaguely predict how they'll behave when we trap them in 'situations' that they can't IM their way out of.","The success that Americans are said to worship is success of a specific sort: accomplished not through hard work, primarily, but through the ingenious angle, the big break. Sit down at a lunch counter, stand back up a star. Invest in a new issue and watch it soar. Split a single atom, win a war.","In the age of networked everything, life moves sideways and covers lots of ground while barely touching the earth.","A sociopath doesn't warm up their environment, doesn't make it cozy. They don't have to; when they're not performing, when they're not manipulating, when they're all alone, there's nothing.","I review books as a day job, and through the years I've come to view the contemporary memoir as, almost always, a saga of victimization, sometimes by others, sometimes by the self, and sometimes by illness or misfortune, leading, like clockwork, to healing and redemption.","The reason con artists get away with what they get away with is, their victims are ashamed of their own blindness and their own gullibility, and they tend to just quietly go away.","Here's how adaptation works - almost everything in the movie is in the book in some form. But it's as though the deck has been completely reshuffled and some of the cards have been assigned different values, some of the fours have been made into jacks, and some of the jacks have been made into twos.","People can be so neglectful of each other and of their own heritage - then death intrudes. Conversations we wish that we'd had earlier are had too late.","One of the saddest things about publishing is how quickly it ages what it touches. The frenzy involved in getting books on shelves, and in putting the word out that they're there, moves at a speed that is not the speed of writing, let alone of reading.","Every generation looks at literature through the lens of their own experience, but with the Bible, everyone gets apprehensive and thinks it'll be too stuffy.","Uncertainty doesn't make life worth living, quite, but it does make striving and gambling worth attempting.","My mother used to push 'Wuthering Heights' on me as a boy, and I sensed from her breathy description of the story that it would make me laugh. I have no plans to find out if this is true.","I like to think that I could praise the good book of someone I personally dislike. I try not to comment on the person, to be insulting, but I have no trouble being insulting to the work.","I remember the first time I went to Italy when I was eighteen, I was in Florence and there were all these eighteen, nineteen, twenty-year-olds gliding past on Vespas with crinkly, long, hair, and I thought I was on the set of a movie. I couldn't believe that this was going on and I hadn't known about it before. I was flabbergasted.","I've come to learn that the determined and gifted and genuine sociopath has far more power to deceive than we realize.","Since the founding of Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and other mainstays of what technology writers have come to call 'the social Web' or 'Web 2.0,' a sizable portion of humanity has learned to be together while apart, sacrificing intimacy for control and spontaneity for predictability.","No matter how you cut them, paste them, rotate them, or distort them, lip syncing and air-guitar playing are fundamentally foolish activities, and anyone seen to be engaging in them with anything approaching a straight face is, by definition, taking herself or himself much too seriously.","The future of time, of how it's won or lost, endured or enjoyed, expanded or compressed, will depend on how it's valued, not how it's measured.","I'm a novelist, a critic, an essayist - I tend to see politics as a subset of cultures rather than the other way around. It's a human enterprise, a tool or a technology revealing our collective inner self.","Guns can turn you into an insider even if you're an outsider by nature, recruiting you into a loose fraternity of people who feel embattled and defensive and are primally eager to win allies.","A writer who isn't writing is asking for trouble.","Ask Jeeves! Who ever used that thing? College freshmen to find out who Goethe was - that's it.","The room-service Caesar salads with soggy croutons, the distant relatives who show up at readings pitching weird, far-fetched investment schemes, the fans who have you sign a book to 'Cathy' and then tell you, 'No, it's Kathy with a K' - it gets challenging after a while. It tests your stamina.","I've been around - having gone to Princeton, and I went to Oxford after that - some pretty fancy characters in my life. And they're just as nutty as the rest of us - sometimes worse.","I grew up in a little town in Minnesota, 500 people. I went out to Princeton, and I wasn't very well-accepted out there by the fancy folks of Princeton University, I felt. I came away bruised and feeling rejected.","There are two sides to me. One is the writer. That's a savage person who looks at everything as a story and, you know, wants to use real life in his books. The other part is the Midwesterner, who, you know, wants to say nice things about people and be polite.","At college, I wanted to be a poet. I liked the extremely concentrated language, the atmosphere of otherworldliness.","I studied English at Princeton in the early eighties in what I consider a period of high obscurity. Professors and students ran around discussing the work of critics and philosophers that I doubt they'd read or understood.","I'm a magpie in my fiction, taking whatever looks shiny and curious to line the nest of my story.","I have very specific advice for aspiring writers: go to New York. And if you can't go to New York, go to the place that represents New York to you, where the standards for writing are high, there are other people who share your dreams, and where you can talk, talk, talk about your interests.","When we have a favorite writer, it's always the places where they grew up, lived, worked, and that they recreated on the page that we most want to visit and commune with. Faulkner's Mississippi, Raymond Chandler's Los Angeles, etc. The mind of the reader longs to be somewhere, not just anywhere, and certainly not nowhere.","I say 'here's the thing' a lot, both to alert people that I'm about to say something important and to give myself a moment to figure out what that important thing might be, because my head is so often completely empty.","Once you realize just the sort of glut of books that exists out there, it does become incumbent on you not to add to it unless you have a damn good reason.","I think of myself as writing realist American fiction. 'Cynical but hopeful' wouldn't be the worst thing I've ever been called.","I think people get a sense of possibility when they're on a plane, even romantic possibility, wondering if the perfect person is going to sit down next to them or something.","I've noticed that the few times I've traveled first class myself, you've already got your drink, and your coat has been taken by the time the rest of the passengers file on, and it's hard not to feel sorry for them. They're sort of trooping past you like cows to slaughter and you're sitting there in your, you know, wide-body seat.","We're on Twitter with one side of our personality, and Facebook with another, and LinkedIn with another side of our personality, and we're toggling between them. That's just a version of what an impostor does: shifting from one side of their personality to another with lightning speed.","Realize that the game of life is the game of, to some extent, being taken advantage of by people who make a science of it. Whether they are in government or personal life or in business, they're everywhere.","What is it in people, or just in people like me, that would rather let a lie go by, would rather wish it away or minimize it, than point it out and cause the liar embarrassment?","The Bible has been through millions of rounds of exegesis and interpretation, but it hasn't been until quite recently that it's been taken as the absolute truth, to the point where people expect it to inform ideas about biology and life on this planet.","When I was writing about the Republican primaries, it was as though the Bible was a black box that people reached into to pull out edicts and prejudices and rules and opinions, and I wish they had fact-checked it! Especially Rick Santorum.","God is a freaking character, with enough foibles, tantrums, and paradoxical behaviors to supply a thousand screenplays. But who do you cast?","A writer is someone who tells you one thing so someday he can tell his readers another thing: what he was thinking but declined to say, or what he would have thought had he been wiser. A writer turns his life into material, and if you're in his life, he uses yours, too.","The least sexy city is Los Angeles. And it poses as the most sexy. As you grow up, L.A. is being sold to you as home of the bikini-clad party girls. And then you get there, and it's full of very goal-oriented, yoga-obsessed careerists.","I had the impression from reading English literature that British women were great beauties, and I only had seen Julie Christie, and she was gorgeous and sexy. I don't know whether it was just my taste, but when I got to London, I went two years without seeing a truly attractive woman. A lot of near misses.","We want to believe that we're invulnerable, and that people who get tricked deserve it. Well, they don't. And someday the arrogant types who mock the gullible are likely to get their turn to wear the dunce cap.","I'd assumed that a deal was a deal when Princeton admitted me, but I was wrong. The price of getting in - to the university itself, and to the great world it promised to open up - was an endless dunning for nebulous services that weren't included in the initial quote.","In fourth grade, I learned that reading was serious business, not just a pleasant way to pass the time, and that like medicine or engineering, it had a definite, valuable purpose: to foster 'comprehension.'","A president, like a college freshman, can't know in advance which questions he'll have to answer or what topics he'll have to master. He has to be flexible, supple, and responsive. He has to be comfortable with multiple-choice.","Cross the wrong state border with your gun, or wake up one morning to new legislation or a new presidential executive order, and suddenly you're the bad guy, not the good guy. No wonder some gun owners seem so touchy; they feel, at some level, like criminals in waiting.","Size has nothing to do with literature. All legs are long enough to touch the ground, and all books are big enough to fill their covers.","However old-fashioned and right-wing this may sound, the American genius for language lies in understatement, in saying things simply, pointedly and quickly, and in making new and clean and swift what otherwise might be ponderous, round and slow.","Stopping to think is fine for characters, but not for their creators. They have to work.","My primary ambition is to be a fiction writer... Being a critic wasn't an aspiration of mine.","According to the perverse aesthetics of artistic guilty pleasure, certain books and movies are so bad - so crudely conceived, despicably motivated and atrociously executed - that they're actually rather good.","To young people born under the weird planet of the SAT, intelligence was equated with agility, with raw acuity. It produced a certain sort of person of which I was a typical specimen: the mental contortionist, able to rise to almost every challenge placed before him, except the challenge of real self-knowledge.","The strange anthropological lesson of social media is that human beings, if given a choice, often prefer to socialize alone.","On the Web, we can be whoever we wish to be, editing the face we show to others in ways that aren't possible in physical space. We can also fine-tune the complexity and depth of our interactions and relationships.","There are two different forms of storytelling: Novels tend to come from the inside of a character, and movies tend to look at them from the outside in relation to others in their world.","You're able to do things in novels: introduce subplots, other characters, thematic layers and so on, in a way that you simply can't in a movie. A movie really has to choose its battles.","You have plausible deniability, as they say in politics, as an author with movies. Because if the movie is terrible, you simply say they failed to catch the genius of the book.","Good short-story collections, like good record albums, are almost always hit-and-miss affairs - successful if they include three or four great tracks, wildly successful if they have five. And that's as it should be.","Short stories are fiction's R & D department, and failed or less-than-conclusive experiments are not just to be expected but to be hoped for.","Let the novelists fret about consistency - story writers should feel free to jam; to get things right in new, surprising ways by allowing themselves, now and then, to get things wrong.","Nothing is less suspenseful than a threat that threatens the maker of the threat at least as much as the subject of the threat. Congress hasn't learned this yet, but America has learned it over and over.","The reason that last-ditch political maneuvering has become business as usual in Washington is that the actors involved are drunk on blame and are convinced that the voting public is, too. They count on outrage, thereby spreading numbness. They cherish the prospect of partisan fury, thereby inspiring nonpartisan disgust.","When I shoot at the range, I don't feel personally powerful but like the custodian of something powerful. I feel like a successful disciplinarian of something radically alien and potent. Analyze this sensation all you want; you still can't make it go away.","Statistics on the dangers guns pose to the health of their owners and those who live with them suggest that I'd be safer selling my guns than reserving them for 'Tombstone II.'","Horror and panic themselves are forms of violence, and diminishing them, restricting their dimensions, is itself a civilizing act.","A loving mother-son relationship is always a plot or outwitting of some kind. 'Don't tell anyone, but...' my mother was always saying to me - when I wasn't saying it to her.","I read somewhere once that in the 1960s, fiction writers were troubled by the notion that life was becoming stranger and more sensational than made-up stories could ever hope to be. Our new problem - more profound, I think - is that life no longer resembles a story. Events intersect but don't progress. People interact but don't make contact.","E-mails, phone calls, Web sites, videos. They're still all letters, basically, and they've come to outnumber old-fashioned conversations. They are the conversation now.","Everyone his own cinematographer. His own stream-of-consciousness e-mail poet. His own nightclub DJ. His own political columnist. His own biographer of his top-10 friends!","Literary dementia seems dated now, but there was a time when a month in the funny farm was as de rigueur for budding writers as an M.F.A. is now. To be sent away was a badge of honor; to undergo electroshock, a glorious martyrdom.","Writing about the future and the past is less a way of dramatizing change than of showing, by way of contrast, what abides.","If the future, as imagined in literature, is really the present taken to extremes, then the past is also the present, but boiled down.","Truth is stranger than nonfiction. And life is too interesting to be left to journalists. People have stories, but journalists have 'takes,' and it's their takes that usually win out when the stories are too complicated or, as happens, not complicated enough.","The fictionally correct have all the answers, and that's what's wrong with them. They're artistic technocrats. There's no dilemma so knotty, no question so baffling, that it can't be smoothly neutralized by dialing up the right attitude adjustment. Poor old Hemingway. If only he'd known.","Size matters in fiction, but so does lack of size. Everything else being equal, fat novels tend to be perceived as serious, very thin ones as more honest, more real. Writers address these age-old expectations by filling their big books with philosophy and cramming their little ones with feeling.","If writers, like comedians or singers, could only hear themselves bombing as they worked, it's likely that certain books would be cut short after the first few leaden sentences.","It's been a concern of mine for years that the mainstream media coverage of culture and politics takes place in two nodes, Washington and New York, and yet all the voting goes on somewhere else.","Remember daydreams? No, of course you don't. How could you? Three new text messages have just arrived, and another three, in a moment, will go out.","The idea that Americans favor politicians who either remind them of themselves or can imagine what their selves are like because they too have struggled and sung the blues, is, like very best theories of human behavior, immune to falsification by mere evidence.","Yes, in the commercial world there's room for both McDonald's and Whole Foods, but in the realm of politics, we're told, it's either Filet-o-Fish or line-caught salmon: only one can prevail - and which is up to you.","In a world that's smarter than it used to be and, in some ways, smarter than it ought to be, stupidity has a way of making us seem all the more human.","It's no accident that most self-help groups use 'anonymous' in their names; to Americans, the first step toward redemption is a ritual wiping out of the self, followed by the construction of a new one.","In America, to be ID'd - sorted, tagged, and permanently filed - is to lose a bit of one's soul. To die a little. This sounds like a subtle, poetic notion. It's not. In American legal and cultural tradition, one essential privilege of citizenship is not having to prove it on demand."],"Walter Koenig":["Religious tolerance is something we should all practice; however, there have been more persecution and atrocities committed in the name of religion and religious freedom than anything else.","I'm always looking for a low-budget script with an interesting character to play.","Well, an actor is an actor is actor, to paraphrase someone or other and the opportunity to work, to have a steady engagement, certainly seemed like an appealing concept to me."],"Walter Kohn":["My commitment to a humane and peaceful world continues to this day.","However, while the Nazi barbarians and their collaborators threatened the entire world, I could not accept his philosophy and, after several earlier attempts, was finally accepted into the Canadian Infantry Corps during the last year of World War II.","My father, who had lost a brother, fighting on the Austrian side in World War I, was a committed pacifist.","On another level, I want to mention that I have a strong Jewish identity and - over the years - have been involved in several Jewish projects, such as the establishment of a strong program of Judaic Studies at the University of California in San Diego.","I have just joined the Board of the Population Institute because I am convinced that early stabilization of the world's population is important for the attainment of this objective.","I was born in 1923 into a middle class Jewish family in Vienna, a few years after the end of World War I, which was disastrous from the Austrian point of view.","I was fortunate to find an extraordinary mathematics and applied mathematics program in Toronto.","During one or two summers, as well as part-time during the school year, I worked for a small Canadian company which developed electrical instruments for military planes.","Originally I had planned to revert to nuclear physics there, in particular the structure of the deuteron.","My project was radiation damage of Si and Ge by energetic electrons, critical for the use of the recently developed semiconductor devices for applications in outer space.","In particular, I established a reasonably accurate energy threshold for permanent displacement of a nucleus from its regular lattice position, substantially smaller than had been previously presumed."],"Walter Lang":["Any concept of one person being superior to another can lead to racism.","It seems we will continue to have problems with this classification and it may be because it comes under the heading of creation rather than preservation.","If we knew exactly what animal life was like before the fall into sin and knew what nature was like before the law of entropy invaded it, we would already be living in heaven.","If leaders in the space program had at its beginning in the 1940s, pointed out the benefits to people on earth rather than emphasizing the search for proof of evolution in space, the program would have saved $100 billion in tax money and achieved greater results.","Sex is not sinful, but sin has perverted it.","The Moon and Mars were the two most likely candidates for life in the solar system; what exists beyond our solar system is mere guesswork.","There are also scientific problems with the concept that each of the creation days was a long period of time.","God has stated in clear and concise language how He created the universe and we ought not to doubt His Word.","We agree that man was not created to survive in space.","Neither does man have gills for living in a water environment; yet it is not sinful to explore the depths of the oceans in search of food or other blessings.","Scripture suggests that the elements in space were created for the benefit of earth, while evolution suggests that earth is an insignificant speck in vast space.","Angels possess greater powers than do human beings.","A creationist can embarrass an evolutionist by asking for a definition of species.","Following the creation concept that creation processes differed from preservation processes, it is suggested that God endowed each created kind, at the time of its creation, with potential for vast variety.","No writer of a portion of the Bible was perfect. It was the direct and miraculous operation of the Holy Spirit that what they wrote is without mistake.","In Christ the original image of God is restored, by faith in this world and by sight in the world to come.","Being made in the image of God, man was the crown of creation.","Therefore, sins of sex are punished in this life to a greater degree than some other sins.","Some people turn from God because they cannot understand how a good God can permit evil in the world.","This solution may not appeal to our human pride, but the problem is that our human pride in itself is sinful.","Essentially this promise before curse, this superiority of God's love in Christ, must come from the Bible.","Language expresses people's thinking and it was by a Word that God created the world and preserves it.","Accordingly, one race is neither superior nor inferior to another.","Thus, races arose from an original coding which God pulled out as needed for adaptation to the environment.","In the beginning of the human race there was no genetic load which would cause undesirable traits such as appear in offspring of marriages between relatives today.","Science is defined in various ways, but today it is generally restricted to something which is experimental, which is repeatable, which can be predicted, and which is falsifiable.","Time was God's first creation.","Time is not eternal but was created by God at the beginning.","Essential to the theory of evolution is the premise that everything has come into being by itself.","With our knowledge of modern-day genetics, we realize that it was possible for God to place the potential for all people throughout history into the genes of Adam and Eve when He created them.","But, when Scripture makes a clear distinction between the act of creation and the process of preservation, we cannot accept the idea of a progressive creation process."],"Walter Legge":["I disliked singing in English and neither liked the story nor the character of Cressida.","I am convinced that in the arts, committees are useless.","Democracy is fatal for the arts; it leads only to chaos or the achievement of new and lower common denominators of quality."],"Walter Lippmann":["The first principle of a civilized state is that the power is legitimate only when it is under contract.","It requires wisdom to understand wisdom: the music is nothing if the audience is deaf.","Social movements are at once the symptoms and the instruments of progress. Ignore them and statesmanship is irrelevant; fail to use them and it is weak.","The genius of a good leader is to leave behind him a situation which common sense, without the grace of genius, can deal with successfully.","The opposition is indispensable. A good statesman, like any other sensible human being, always learns more from his opposition than from his fervent supporters.","The private citizen, beset by partisan appeals for the loan of his Public Opinion, will soon see, perhaps, that these appeals are not a compliment to his intelligence, but an imposition on his good nature and an insult to his sense of evidence.","The radical novelty of modern science lies precisely in the rejection of the belief... that the forces which move the stars and atoms are contingent upon the preferences of the human heart.","Private property was the original source of freedom. It still is its main ballpark.","Our conscience is not the vessel of eternal verities. It grows with our social life, and a new social condition means a radical change in conscience.","There is no arguing with the pretenders to a divine knowledge and to a divine mission. They are possessed with the sin of pride, they have yielded to the perennial temptation.","Ages when custom is unsettled are necessarily ages of prophecy. The moralist cannot teach what is revealed; he must reveal what can be taught. He has to seek insight rather than to preach.","He has honor if he holds himself to an ideal of conduct though it is inconvenient, unprofitable, or dangerous to do so.","A long life in journalism convinced me many presidents ago that there should be a large air space between a journalist and the head of a state.","The simple opposition between the people and big business has disappeared because the people themselves have become so deeply involved in big business.","Where all men think alike, no one thinks very much.","We are all captives of the picture in our head - our belief that the world we have experienced is the world that really exists.","Once you touch the biographies of human beings, the notion that political beliefs are logically determined collapses like a pricked balloon.","Most men, after a little freedom, have preferred authority with the consoling assurances and the economy of effort it brings.","The best servants of the people, like the best valets, must whisper unpleasant truths in the master's ear. It is the court fool, not the foolish courtier, whom the king can least afford to lose.","When distant and unfamiliar and complex things are communicated to great masses of people, the truth suffers a considerable and often a radical distortion. The complex is made over into the simple, the hypothetical into the dogmatic, and the relative into an absolute.","In government offices which are sensitive to the vehemence and passion of mass sentiment public men have no sure tenure. They are in effect perpetual office seekers, always on trial for their political lives, always required to court their restless constituents.","People that are orthodox when they are young are in danger of being middle-aged all their lives.","The study of error is not only in the highest degree prophylactic, but it serves as a stimulating introduction to the study of truth.","No amount of charters, direct primaries, or short ballots will make a democracy out of an illiterate people.","The final test of a leader is that he leaves behind him in other men the conviction and the will to carry on.","We are quite rich enough to defend ourselves, whatever the cost. We must now learn that we are quite rich enough to educate ourselves as we need to be educated.","Brains, you know, are suspect in the Republican Party.","There is nothing so good for the human soul as the discovery that there are ancient and flourishing civilized societies which have somehow managed to exist for many centuries and are still in being though they have had no help from the traveler in solving their problems.","Industry is a better horse to ride than genius.","Men who are orthodox when they are young are in danger of being middle-aged all their lives.","Ideals are an imaginative understanding of that which is desirable in that which is possible.","A man has honor if he holds himself to an ideal of conduct though it is inconvenient, unprofitable, or dangerous to do so.","When all men think alike, no one thinks very much.","Many a time I have wanted to stop talking and find out what I really believed.","It is perfectly true that that government is best which governs least. It is equally true that that government is best which provides most.","When men can no longer be theists, they must, if they are civilized, become humanists.","The great social adventure of America is no longer the conquest of the wilderness but the absorption of fifty different peoples.","Only the consciousness of a purpose that is mightier than any man and worthy of all men can fortify and inspirit and compose the souls of men.","The tendency of the casual mind is to pick out or stumble upon a sample which supports or defies its prejudices, and then to make it the representative of a whole class.","The time has come to stop beating our heads against stone walls under the illusion that we have been appointed policeman to the human race.","When philosophers try to be politicians they generally cease to be philosophers.","In a free society the state does not administer the affairs of men. It administers justice among men who conduct their own affairs.","Success makes men rigid and they tend to exalt stability over all the other virtues; tired of the effort of willing they become fanatics about conservatism.","What we call a democratic society might be defined for certain purposes as one in which the majority is always prepared to put down a revolutionary minority.","Unless the reformer can invent something which substitutes attractive virtues for attractive vices, he will fail."],"Walter Lord":["It would be nice to say the rich people, the fancy people, all behaved like bastards and the poor slobs all came through like heroes. But as a matter of fact, sometimes the poor slobs behave like slobs and the great, noble, privileged characters come off very well, indeed.","Brilliantly lit from stem to stern, she looked like a sagging birthday cake.","Someone once told me the one thread that runs through them all is a premium on personal courage - not intellectual courage, but just plain physical courage.","Events alone rarely provide much guide to the future.","You have to study the people and the ones that measure up are not always the ones you expect.","I never earned a dollar that was not somehow through writing.","I look for something that is highly unusual, involving ordinary people caught in extraordinary situations.","There were exceptions, a couple of families that just plain didn't want to even think about it, although forty years had passed but mostly the people were very interested in talking about it.","It's a funny thing, but today the Titanic is probably much more - that is people are much more aware of it than they were in 1954, when I was doing my research."],"Walter Map":["If die I must, let me die drinking in an Inn.","The Cistercians do not eat meat...

You need to remember that if you're living for and walking with Jesus Christ, the powers of darkness are aligned against you.","A biblical false prophet was a servant of the devil attempting to lead people away from the truth.","I am not saying we are categorizing Ellen White in the biblical context of a false prophet.","And yet, you do not throw out some of the great minds of the Church - and people in Church history - and say they have no credibility because they committed a sin or made a mistake.","The very success of medicine in a material way may now threaten the soul of medicine.","Christ imparts the capacity of conquest to our lives every single day that we are willing to believe Him.","God does say He will graciously entertain our prayers. He says that if we exercise faith, and if our request is in accordance with His will, He will hear us.","However, the Bible is called the Word of God because the whole transcript is an inspired, faithful, and infallible record of what God determined essential for us to know about Himself, the cosmos in which we live, our spiritual allies and adversaries, and our fellow man.","I am a friend of Adventist people and a lover of truth.","I am not an enemy of Adventism.","I thought some of Mrs. White's material was prophetic. I felt some of her insights were extremely helpful and I regarded her as a sister in the Lord. I wasn't out to attack Ellen White's character.","Mrs. White, in my opinion, made false statements. She misused what she claimed was the prophetic gift she had.","What I did was, I went and collected every bit of information from Adventist publishing houses in the basic areas of doctrine covered in the book Questions on Doctrine.","Who knows the minds of men and how they reason and what their methodology is? But I am not going to extrapolate from the General Conference backing out on my book and make it a personal issue.","You see, 30 years ago I didn't have near the audience I have now. My tapes on the cults have reached a circulation of 15 million. those are not my figures but the figures of the people who distribute them."],"Walter Matthau":["I wanted to be a pharmacist. I liked the way our local pharmacist was always dressed in a nice white coat; he looked very calm, you'd give him money, and he'd give you something that you wanted to buy.","My doctor gave me six months to live, but when I couldn't pay the bill he gave me six months more.","It's very easy to live here. You're anonymous here. Nobody knows who you are.","Every actor looks all his life for a part that will combine his talents with his personality... 'The Odd Couple' was mine.

Among the Porcupines?","The first girl you go to bed with is always pretty."],"Walter Mosley":["When you deal with a person who's experiencing dementia, you can see where they're struggling with knowledge. You can see what they forget completely, what they forget but they know what they once knew. You can tell how they're trying to remember.","I took up writing to escape the drudgery of that every day cubicle kind of war.","My father always taught by telling stories about his experiences. His lessons were about morality and art and what insects and birds and human beings had in common. He told me what it meant to be a man and to be a Black man. He taught me about love and responsibility, about beauty, and how to make gumbo.","I would have been completely brainwashed by this lopsided and racist view of the world if it weren't for my father. He was a deep thinker and an irrepressible problem solver. He was a Black Socrates, asking why and then spoiling ready-made replies.","There's many things that I am. And all of those things come together at some point. If somebody wants to limit me, you know and they'll say, 'Well, this is Walter Mosley, the mystery writer.' I don't like that. Because I do many things.","When I went to school, there were no Black philosophers, at least none that I was aware of, who were recognized by Western universities.","Poetry teaches us music, metaphor, condensation and specificity.","I think that people don't know how to do anything anymore. My father was a janitor. He could take a car apart and put it back together. He could build a house in the back yard. Today, if you ask people what they know, they say, 'I know how to hire someone.'","At one time if you were a black writer you had to be one of the best writers in the world to be published. You had to be great. Now you can be good. Mediocre. And that's good.","My father cared about the world he lived in, and so he admitted his confusion about his place in America because he didn't want me to make the same mistake in my life.","When I turned 59, I looked at that as the first day of my 60th year, so I've been 60 for the last 365 days, in my opinion. So I've been thinking all this year, I'm 60 - this is the time when I need to get some stuff done.","I'm almost completely without family and it's a very odd feeling in life. I have no children.","Losing my parents really set me adrift in more ways than one. It's not just losing them. It's losing the possibility of family.","My father's life was so decimated by his earliest experiences. His mother died when he was 7 years old, which he always said was the worst experience in his life. When he was 8, his father disappeared and he was on his own from the age of 8.","All writing is that structure of revelation. There's something you want to find out. If you know everything up front in the beginning, you really don't need to read further if there's nothing else to find out.","I don't ever know where I'm going. Because one of the wonderful things about writing, which is different than working in programming, you don't need to know. You could just write and discover where you're going. And it's a great deal of fun.","I've written a lot of really good books. Now we'll see if I can write any more good books. I mean there's a chance I won't, but I'm going to try.","We live in capitalism, and capitalism is defined by the production line, and the production line is defined by specificity. If you see yourself as an artist, which I do, then you can't be limited by that. You can't let somebody tell you, 'Well, you can only draw this kind of picture or write that kind of book.'","I've always loved science fiction. I think the smartest writers are science fiction writers dealing with major things.","My hero in comic books is Jack Kirby: 'Spider-Man,' 'Fantastic Four,' 'Captain America,' Marvel Comics. He was really the basis for Marvel Comics.","A lot of people... kind of make heroes that are separate from us, people who are, you know, like... John Wayne and Errol Flynn and, you know, Denzel Washington... people who are different, who are larger than life.","HBO and I have a deal to at least try to make a television series from the Leonid McGill stories. We're going to start with the first novel, 'The Long Fall.'","All of the philosophers I studied were white (with a few Eastern exceptions), and, for that matter, they were all male. Africa, the cradle of civilization, seemed to have no footing in the highest form of human thought."],"Walter Murch":["Film editing is now something almost everyone can do at a simple level and enjoy it, but to take it to a higher level requires the same dedication and persistence that any art form does.","Every film is a puzzle really, from an editorial point of view.","Sound is a huge influence on peoples' attention.","My job as an editor is to gently prod the attention of the audience to look at various parts of the frame. And that - I do that by manipulating how and where I cut and what succession of images I work with.","I think every age has a medium that talks to it more eloquently than the others. In the 19th century it was symphonic music and the novel. For various technical and artistic reasons, film became that eloquent medium for the 20th century.","Film is really the one art form that can effectively use silence. Music and theater can play with silence, but they can't sustain silence without losing energy, whereas film can go into a silent mode and stay there for minutes at a time.","You can always make a film somehow. You can beg, borrow, steal the equipment, use credit cards, use your friends' goodwill, wheedle your way into this or that situation. The real problem is, how do you get people to see it once it is made?","I was greatly influenced by musique concrete when I was, like, 10. I was completely mesmerized by the idea that you could make music out of sounds. So that's been a constant influence on all my work.","I believe that one of the secret engines that allows cinema to work, and have the marvelous power over us that it does, is the fact that for thousands of years we have spent eight hours every night in a 'cinematic' dream-state, and so are familiar with this version of reality.","Blinking is some way of tabulating - a kind of carriage return, click, or save to disk - that helps the process of 'Okay, now change the subject.' Every time you move your eyes, there's an interruption in the visual field - you go momentarily blind when your eyeballs are moving.","One of the rules of the road is that if you want to create the sense of silence, it frequently has more pungency if you include the tiniest of sounds. By manipulating what you hear and how you hear it and what other things you don't hear, you can not only help tell the story, you can help the audience get into the mind of the character.","This applies to many film jobs, not just editing: half the job is doing the job, and the other half is finding ways to get along with people and tuning yourself in to the delicacy of the situation.","There's a big link between trains and film. One of the first filmed objects was a train. The clickety-clack of the projector and the clickety-clack of the train are similar. There is the idea of the voyage - every voyage is a story. I wonder if film would have been invented without the train.","There are many, many nouns for the act of looking - a glance, a glimpse, a peep - but there's no noun for the act of listening. In general, we don't think primarily about sound. So I have a different perspective on the world; I can construct soundscapes that have an effect on people, but they don't know why. It's a sort of subterfuge.","If you want to freak your cat out, stare at your cat. If you want to reassure your cat, stare at your cat, then very deliberately and very slowly blink. Like that. The cat will also deliberately, slowly blink back at you, and I almost guarantee that she will start to purr. That's a feline reassurance.","I re-mastered 'The Conversation' a few years ago for DVD. 'The Conversation' was the first film I edited on a flatbed machine - a KEM editing machine. I've been using Final Cut or the AVID for 12 years now, so I was interested in looking at this film and seeing if I could tell if it had been edited the old way. Truth be told, I couldn't.","When I'm actually assembling a scene, I assemble it as a silent movie. Even if it's a dialog scene, I lip read what people are saying.","The word processor is a better tool than a quill pen because you can do so much more with it, but on the other hand, what you have to say and how you say it is the ultimate determination.","'The Conversation' was the first film I edited on a flatbed machine - a KEM editing machine. I've been using Final Cut or the AVID for 12 years now, so I was interested in looking at this film and seeing if I could tell if it had been edited the old way.","Every film is hard work, and a few lucky people do get Oscars for what they do, and it's recognition for all that hard work on a certain level. If you didn't do the hard work, you wouldn't be standing there. On the other hand, people do a lot of hard work and don't get Oscars, so it's a mixture of glory and injustice at the same time.","Take any writer you want in the 19th century: they wrote with quill pens, dipping a piece of goose feather in ink and writing. And yet we read those novels today, and if we're sensitive to them, we respond to them with an immediacy that is stronger than anything written today on a word processor.","I would be happy if they just gave out nominations and there weren't any Oscars. But winning them is definitely an experience - to get up there and make a speech. Every film is hard work, and a few lucky people do get Oscars for what they do, and it's recognition for all that hard work on a certain level.","I believe every editor should stand to edit. That's just my particular soapbox. Some things are so delicate and depend on such fine, delicate work. One frame in one direction or another can make such a difference and it is, in that, like brain surgery."],"Walter O'Brien":["Hacking involves a different way of looking at problems that no one's thought of.","Bureaucracy kills people's ability to try new ideas.","Once your IQ is 150 or over, it stops beings ability and becomes a disability.","Problem-solving, inventing, hacking and coding is more of an adrenaline rush of endorphins rather than a feeling.","It's common in rural Ireland to pick up a nickname that relates to an animal, bird, or a spider. Mine became 'scorpion' because I fought back, and scorpions are docile creatures until pushed too far.","Humans have 3 percent human error, and a lot of companies can't afford to be wrong 3 percent of the time anymore, so we close that 3 percent gap with some of the technologies. The AI we've developed doesn't make mistakes.","When I was 13, I thought I was pretty hot stuff because I knew BASIC programming, self-taught on the family's Commodore 64. One of my crowning accomplishments was writing a silly little program that showed a crudely-drawn Space Shuttle lifting off in a cloud of pixelated smoke.","Flying down a tunnel of 1s and 0s is not how hacking is really done.","My personality is extremely unbalanced.","As a youth, I and most of the other smarter kids in school got picked on by bullies. I was a big guy - even at a young age - and would take the beatings for my friends, who were often smaller and scrawnier.","A high IQ individual can't deal in an industry that's subjective.","I am extremely left brain dominant, probably 95%-5%. The feeling side of my brain is not really strong.","I'm proud to be part of the fabric that inspires the next generations to remain curious and remember that 'smart is cool.'","I was about nine years old when a teacher administered my IQ test. Unfortunately, as I was nine, I didn't know that I needed to keep the paperwork for future reference.","I'm left-brain dominant, so anxiety and nervousness don't affect me; most emotions don't.","There are kids going into chemistry and biology because of 'CSI.'","It's an honor to live in and serve the great City of Los Angeles. I'm also immensely grateful for the support I've received from Ireland.","Much of our brainpower goes unused, and many people could benefit greatly from optimizing their mental assets.","I've only twice in my life come across someone with both high IQ and high EQ naturally; and that was because their parents were super high EQ, and the parents just EQ'd the hell out of them. They're inevitably very successful because now you've got someone who's sharper than the average person and well-rounded, too.","If you look at any normal organization, the CEO is the person with the highest E.Q. The person with the highest IQ is often in the back room running the financials or the operations. That's topsy turvy.","My left brain has gradually 'eaten' the right-brain capabilities away.","I invite people to read the hundreds of positive articles instead of getting affected by the occasional outburst from a troll.","City of Los Angeles is my home, and it is my duty to lead by example, contribute all that I can, and help make the world a better place with the tools and resources available to me.","We have a 25-year head start for the stories of 'Scorpion.' By the time we get to Season Two and Three, the stuff that happened because of Season One will actually fuel Season Three. So it'll become a self-sustainable show.","Most managers are just trying to survive. That's why a lot of smarter guys have been let go from Fortune 500 companies: because they came up with new ideas that no one would allow them to try.","My personal philosophy is that people should be extremely selfish for the first half of their life and extremely unselfish for the second half because then they can do the most good.","I didn't fit in at school, and I didn't fit in at home, and I didn't know why. I was often lonely.","If you've made enough money where you're not worried about the rent or survival, you start asking yourself why you're on this planet. Your point is to do the most good you can before you die - well, I could do more good if I didn't die.","As software engineers trained to turn ambiguity into absolutes and fuzzy requirements into ones and zeros, we had a 'eureka' moment when we realized that our training had broader, real-world applications.","You have a core competency, something you're better at than I'll ever be, and that's your magic - your pixie dust.","It's a pleasure to contribute to the entrepreneurial community at USC.","I look forward to making tangible and inspirational contributions to the Houston Technology Center's initiatives. HTC is an engine behind Houston's and Texas' continued growth.","The methodologies and best practices used to develop software can be applied successfully to any challenge in life.","Maybe I was unpopular a bit because I was a teacher's pet. But even the teachers complained about me. They would say to my parents, 'For every one question any pupil asks, Walter asks 10.'","I'm a typical Irishman in that I only get home for weddings and funerals.","Having one of the highest IQs ever measured is as much a curse as it is a blessing. My parents were great, though: they were always seeking the most difficult presents possible for me - Rubik's cubes and things like that.","EmTech Asia brings together some of the brightest minds in technology and computer security.","It's an honor for me to contribute to Houston's younger generations and show them that 'smart is cool.'","The California Science Center is a cornerstone in California's push to educate and encourage students to reach their full potential and to pursue careers in science and engineering.","I started the business as a computer consulting business, which, coupled to my nickname, Scorpion, formed the full name Scorpion Computer Services.","At Sussex University, I developed a system called WinLocX to help with the process of translating software into foreign languages.","When I started losing business to salespeople who were using used-car salesmen kind of tactics, I realized I can't ignore the EQ thing; it's going to kill sales.","High IQ individuals don't like surprises and are pessimistic, because it's logical."],"Walter Pater":["With this sense of the splendour of our experience and of its awful brevity, gathering all we are into one desperate effort to see and touch, we shall hardly have time to make theories about the things we see and touch.","The Renaissance of the fifteenth century was, in many things, great rather by what it designed then by what it achieved.","To burn always with this hard, gem-like flame, to maintain this ecstasy, is success in life.","Not the fruit of experience, but experience itself, is the end.","A counted number of pulses only is given to us of a variegated, dramatic life. How may we see in them all that is to to be seen in them by the finest senses?","Experience, already reduced to a group of impressions, is ringed round for each one of us by that thick wall of personality through which no real voice has ever pierced on its way to us, or from us to that which we can only conjecture to be without.","All art constantly aspires towards the condition of music.","A very intimate sense of the expressiveness of outward things, which ponders, listens, penetrates, where the earlier, less developed consciousness passed lightly by, is an important element in the general temper of our modern poetry.","Art comes to you proposing frankly to give nothing but the highest quality to your moments as they pass.","No account of the Renaissance can be complete without some notice of the attempt made by certain Italian scholars of the fifteenth century to reconcile Christianity with the religion of ancient Greece.","And the fifteenth century was an impassioned age, so ardent and serious in its pursuit of art that it consecrated everything with which art had to ad as a religious object.","That sense of a life in natural objects, which in most poetry is but a rhetorical artifice, was, then, in Wordsworth the assertion of what was for him almost literal fact.","Many attempts have been made by writers on art and poetry to define beauty in the abstract, to express it in the most general terms, to find some universal formula for it.","Such discussions help us very little to enjoy what has been well done in art or poetry, to discriminate between what is more and what is less excellent in them, or to use words like beauty, excellence, art, poetry, with a more precise meaning than they would otherwise have.","What is important, then, is not that the critic should possess a correct abstract definition of beauty for the intellect, but a certain kind of temperament, the power of being deeply moved by the presence of beautiful objects.","The various forms of intellectual activity which together make up the culture of an age, move for the most part from different starting-points, and by unconnected roads.","To regard all things and principles of things as inconstant modes or fashions has more and more become the tendency of modern thought.","At first sight experience seems to bury us under a flood of external objects, pressing upon us with a sharp and importunate reality, calling us out of ourselves in a thousand forms of action.","The service of philosophy, of speculative culture, towards the human spirit, is to rouse, to startle it to a life of constant and eager observation.","In a sense it might even be said that our failure is to form habits: for, after all, habit is relative to a stereotyped world, and meantime it is only the roughness of the eye that makes two persons, things, situations, seem alike.","Not to discriminate every moment some passionate attitude in those about us, and in the very brilliancy of their gifts some tragic dividing on their ways, is, on this short day of frost and sun, to sleep before evening.","Philosophical theories or ideas, as points of view, instruments of criticism, may help us to gather up what might otherwise pass unregarded by us.","One of the most beautiful passages of Rousseau is that in the sixth book of Confessions, where he describes the awakening in him of the literary sense. Of such wisdom, the poetic passion, the desire of beauty, the love of art for its own sake, has most.","Great passions may give us a quickened sense of life, ecstasy and sorrow of love, the various forms of enthusiastic activity, disinterested or otherwise, which comes naturally to many of us.","For art comes to you proposing frankly to give nothing but the highest quality to your moments as they pass, and simply for those moments' sake.","With myself, how to pass time becomes sometimes the question - unavoidably, though it strikes me as a thing unspeakably sad in a life so short as ours."],"Walter Payton":["I am happy to say that everyone that I have met in my life, I have gained something from them; be it negative or positive, it has enforced and reinforced my life in some aspect.","Most important thought, if you love someone, tell him or her, for you never know what tomorrow may have in store.","I want to be remembered like Pete Rose. 'Charlie Hustle.' I want people to say, 'Wherever he was, he was always giving it his all.'","When you speak of role models, when we talk to our kids, everybody is a role model, everyone, just as you look at a Michael Jordan to be the terrific athlete he is.","Remember, tomorrow is promised to no one.","Never die easy. Why run out of bounds and die easy? Make that linebacker pay. It carries into all facets of your life. It's okay to lose, to die, but don't die without trying, without giving it your best.","If you could go back and change things, you might not be the person you are right now.","God's been very good to me. I'm truly blessed.","All people, regardless of whether they're athletes or not, should treat people the way they want to be treated.","During the off-season when you see other people playing in the Super Bowl, you wonder, and you say to yourself, 'Are you ever gonna get there and see what it feels like?' And it pushes you a little bit harder during that off-season to work to try to get there the following year.","Running alone is the toughest. You get to the point where you have to keep pushing yourself.","Money isn't everything. Do you get married because of money? Do you have kids because of money?","There were high school coaches such as Charles Boston that took me under his wing and taught me the fundamentals of football. And when I went to college there was Robert Hill who took me there and he showed me what hard work and determination would do if you put forth the effort and you take a little time.","If I'm going to get hit, why let the guy who's going to hit me get the easiest and best shot? I explode into the guy who's trying to tackle me.","I try to run on the hottest days, at the hottest time, because that's the most difficult time. And sometimes I worry about drying out, and dying.","You look at a Pete Rose to be the terrific athlete he is and then he falls on hard times, but when he played the game, I got something from the way he played the game because he hustled every play, and just because he had one mistake in his life, am I supposed to throw back everything that I gained from him?","I wanted to be a professional drummer.","I developed my training routine going into my senior year at Jackson State. I found this sandbank by the Pearl River near my hometown, Columbia, Miss. I laid out a course of 65 yards or so. Sixty-five yards on sand is like 120 on turf, but running on sand helps you make your cuts at full speed.","I don't have to jump up and smile just because TV wants me to."],"Walter Raleigh":["Fain would I climb, yet fear I to fall.","Whosoever, in writing a modern history, shall follow truth too near the heels, it may happily strike out his teeth."],"Walter Rauschenbusch":["Whoever sets any bounds for the reconstructive power of the religious life over the social relations and institutions of men, to that extent denies the faith of the Master.","Christianity is in its nature revolutionary.","Every generation tries to put its doctrine on a high shelf where the children can not reach it."],"Walter Reisch":["Tired minds don't plan well.

Mr. Obama would be forced back into a war on terror if terrorist groups pull off enough damaging or frightening attacks to force this issue to the fore.","Life isn't easy, and leadership is harder still.","Mr. Obama's approach to engagement to some degree makes him dependent on people who wish neither him nor America well. This doesn't have to end badly and I hope that it doesn't - but it's not an ideal position after one's first year in power.","Unlike some, I don't claim to hold the mystic key to the future.

And there is satisfaction in seeing that the Iraqis are successful in resisting the United States.","You look at the steamboat, the railroad, the car, the airplane - not all of these were invented in the Anglo-American world, but they were popularized and extended by it. They were made possible by the financial architecture, the capital intensive operations invented and developed by the Anglo-Americans.","This very individualistic form of Protestant Christianity that became so basic in English and then American life is to a large degree responsible for the historical success of Britain and America.","It is a kind of ego booster, the way Egypt's winning the 1973 war, in the first stages, was an uplift.

We're a very young culture, and I think that things are not yet crystallised.","I come from Brazil, which is a Portuguese speaking part of the continent.","I did documentaries for maybe 10 years before I turned to fiction films.","I went to Cuba maybe eight or nine times.","I'm much more interested in living specific experiences in films.","It was a complex endeavor so without Robert Redford's constant support we wouldn't have gotten to the end.","My father was a diplomat for part of his life and I jumped from country to country and culture to culture.","No, I worked a lot for European television, doing documentaries in Brazil.","So I feel a responsibility to help first-time film-makers in Brazil, but also to increase the dialogue between film cultures which are really wonderful and so much closer to us than what we do see on our screens.","So the search for a father in Central Station is also a search for a country.","So when I was very young, I longed for Brazil.","That's why I have always admired documentaries, because they open windows that can make you understand much better where you come from, much better than fiction, I think.","The necessity to conceptualise has to come very early on, and defining a vector of development for that film also at the beginning of the process will allow you much more freedom as you go along.","The other aspect is that you become much more aware of the structural problems that pertain to that continent. You feel the need to act to try and solve them.","The Peruvian faces are completely different from that faces in Argentina and in Brazil.","The Sundance Institute has been vital to the film communities of Latin America.","We all knew the book well because it's the cult book in Latin America.

I know there is a lot of resentment from other clubs about that, but it's a fact.","If you can achieve winning a league championship, that, to me, is the full test of the team and management because it is over the full season and you have a lot of problems you have to overcome.","The Old Firm clubs are not easy clubs to manage and sometimes I think frustration comes in that, in the end, make you happy to be leaving.","I started out in Scotland, not as a footballer of any note, and I didn't play to draw the attention of people abroad."],"Walter Ulbricht":["The success of each of us benefits us all, and the success of us all benefits each of us individually.","Something new has happened: For the first time in German history our fatherland is guided by a plan that considers only the needs of the people, and aims at building prosperity and reconstructing of our fatherland.","The guiding principle is not to manufacture the goods everyone needs, rather to earn profits for a few capitalists.","This hunger for profits causes great misery for the people.","Let there be great enthusiasm for the plan throughout the entire republic that will overcome all obstacles.

Without such planning, things would quickly go awry.","When has there ever been a government in German history that came to the people and revealed its detailed plans for the coming years? That could not happen before, since German governments planned war and conquest.","The West German population would protest passionately if it knew what secret meetings between the federal chancellor, McCoy, and foreign and Nazi generals are planning.","The government of the German Democratic Republic rejects secret policies.

Some experiments done at Einstein's suggestion yielded no decisively new result.","Direction coupling between the various radiations generated in a nuclear reaction both with one another and with the initiating radiation can also be detected and measured by coincidences; this provides valuable information about the structure of the atomic nuclei.","In this case, the particle formed has correspondingly less energy, whereas the product nucleus passes into the ground state with emission of the quantity of energy saved as gamma radiation.","Many applications of the coincidence method will therefore be found in the large field of nuclear physics, and we can say without exaggeration that the method is one of the essential tools of the modern nuclear physicist.","Rossi was the first to describe another system working with valves in parallel; it has the advantage that it can easily be extended to coincidences between more than two events, and is therefore predominantly used today.","Strict conservation of energy in the elementary process had thus been confirmed also by a negative experiment.","The Laboratory for Radioactivity consisted of only two rooms at the time; at a later date, when tests of radioactive substances became more extensive, it expanded into four rooms.","The material particle nature of primary cosmic radiation has been confirmed, although the processes turned out to be extraordinarily more complicated than we had assumed.","This result was confirmed by different researchers using various experimental arrangements.","To demonstrate this simultaneity is by no means trivial, because it may for example happen that the product nucleus always forms in an activated state at first."],"Walton Goggins":["I quite like antiques.

If I'm pulling from things from my own life, then I think I'm being disingenuous to the character and the story.","You know, I'm from the South, and I wasn't interested in perpetuating a stereotypical southern character.","Like everybody, I've had a lot of pain in my life and I'm a work in progress. You must have a true desire to see the world from a different point of view, and that comes with growing up.","I do not have the angst and the anxiety of my youth.

And they're totally different - you can't necessarily be funny on a video, and then all of a sudden you're live in a theater. You don't have the tools yet. It's a lot more involved to go from being funny on a little iPhone screen to being live in front of people and being funny.","I have problems with YouTube and things like that, when you catch it mid production. If I'm doing a show and I'm working on a bit and someone's there with a phone, they record it and put it online - it's not the finished product.","I'm here today because I refused to be unhappy.

You don't want people to judge them on your last project.","I had real big boobs, and I just got tired of knocking over stuff. Every time I eat, 'Oh, Lord'. I'd carry a Tide stick everywhere I go. My back was sore, so it was time to have a reduction.","It wasn't until after the reduction that in the lab work, the pathology, that they found that I had DCIS (ductal carcinoma in situ) in my left breast.

I just knew that's not what I was supposed to be doing with my life.","People - I hate to use the word 'fans' - are very respectful. It's not like I'm some pop idol or big movie star. I'm very approachable, and I love the people who enjoy me, because they react like they've run into a friend. Usually, it's like, 'Hey, Wanda! How ya' doing?'","But I think funny and talent will always win out; I mean, of course there are hurdles, but I think if you're funny you will get over all of that.","Actually, I majored in marketing and I have a bachelor of science.","I have a funny family, but none of them are remotely in show business.","And then also I think it's harder for women because comedy is so opposite of being ladylike.","A woman would pitch a joke. Nothing. Then a guy would pitch it and everybody would laugh.","I think it's because my comedy is in your face, and it comes from a place that's real.","Usually, there's nothing being thrown toward the stage or at me. Then I feel pretty good about it.","I noticed recently, in the last few shows I did, that I'm starting to get people - not a large group, but quite a few people - who come to see me because they love Curb Your Enthusiasm.","I'm really funny now.","In '87, I used to do this awful, awful James Brown impression.","Back then, I was doing more of my impression of what a comic is supposed to do.","It seems like when I first started, people got into comedy because they wanted to be good comedians.","Then you had people who wanted to get into comedy just to get a TV deal.","Some government workers are dedicated and work hard, but most of them are just waiting to retire.","I like doing a bunch of different things, being all over the place.","I always want to go back and do stand-up; I like the freedom.","I guess because of my act, people think that I say things they want to say, and that they can just come up and say anything to me.","Don't bother me while I'm eating, or when I'm coming out of the crackhouse or something. Just let me get going.","I love Costas. He's knows too much, but he's a good guy.","It's hard to get fired from the government. You have to, like, kill people.","If something stinks, I say it stinks. But I try to massage it a little and not be as cutting, come behind it with a joke: Hey, I cut you deep, but now let me put a couple of stitches in you.","I work hard. The staff and crew see how much energy I put into this project, and it makes them step up.","If you're passionate about your work, it makes the people around you want to be involved too.","But sometimes the women writers will pitch something and I'll hear it, but the men will keep talking.","I'm always thinking of stuff; I just don't sit down and write it. I come up with material more as I go along; if something funny happens, I'll make a note of it on my phone.","I don't like doing the same material over and over again. It's not fun.","I watched a lot of comedy growing up.","I enjoy stand-up because it has the biggest reward: instant gratification. You can hear the people laughing.","I watch Jay. I watch 'Letterman'. I flip back and forth between 'Conan' and 'Letterman', especially the top of the show for those guys.","I'm finally just relaxed and comfortable with who I am.","I don't understand why people really get upset about something that doesn't affect them at all.","When I'm not on T.V. or working on a movie, I'm on the road doing stand-up. That's my roots.","I was funny around my family. My family, they're pretty funny, too.","The first time onstage, a light went on. 'OK, this is my thing. I'm comfortable here. This is my thing.'","It's not until you develop your own voice, your own persona onstage that you become your own comic, who you really are.","If I did a talk show, this would allow me to speak on what's happening at that moment. I can be current, and I get to flex my stand-up muscle but stay at home without doing the traveling.","Sometimes black people really want to hold onto our oppression - 'This is ours! This belongs to us.' You can't just talk about equality for somebody else. Let's pass it on. Let's pass it on to somebody else. At the end of the day, it is all about inequality.","The government shouldn't be involved in this because it's very simple. If you don't believe in same-sex marriage, then don't marry somebody of the same sex.","I really can't pinpoint the one moment when I said I want to be a comic.","There's obviously a group who enjoys what Tyler Perry is putting out there. And why fault them? And there's a group that loves the things that Spike does. So they should enjoy that, too. Is it my taste? Maybe not, but I'm not going to fault anybody for doing what they're doing as long as people are showing up.","I have a very diverse crowd from old, young, black, white, straight, gay. It's a little bit of everybody.","I'm a huge Sia fan. I love Sia, I have just about all of her stuff.","I'm a stand-up comic. I'm always doing dates; it's just that, if I'm working on a project or I'm busy, I can't get out on the road or book any shows. Since the beginning of my career, I'm usually out for at least 10-15 dates throughout the year. If I have time, then I try to get at least 30-40 dates.","My shows and my material are grounded in reality. It's pretty much something that's either happened in my life or in the news, and I start there and give you my take on it.","I tried theatre. I played Miss Hannigan for a short run of Annie at a regional theatre. That was fun. I enjoyed it! I enjoy theatre and have so much respect for theatre actors.","That's why I talk about the breast cancer: because I want women - and everyone - to stay on top of things and get checked. I know how scary it can be. When I dealt with it, I was like, 'Oh my God.' And I have so many other friends who have gone through it or have suffered a loss.","I worked with people like Edward Snowden. Well, not people who took stuff home.","I had breast cancer. Yeah, I know it's scary.","I have a lot of breast cancer history on my mother's side of the family.","D.C. is where I started. That's home for me. I always love coming back to the area. They treat me so well, and people show up. They're excited and claim me as their own. I love it.","There's so many good comedians in D.C. I started hanging out with those guys. Dave Chappelle was there. Actually, Dave was too young to be in the clubs, so when his mom couldn't make it, he would ask me to pretend I was his aunt, so he could do open mike.","My voice is distinctive: there's a rhythm to it, and also, it's funny. I was just blessed with a funny-sounding voice.","I knew I was outspoken when I was a kid because, whenever my parents had company coming over, they would pay me to leave. 'Go see your grandmother. Get out of here.' That was my first paying gig.","Stand-up, by far, is my favorite.","I have to be socially aware; I feel like that's my job.","I'm constantly preparing. Material hits me; I'm always writing. I go back and listen to my shows and just prepare and put my set together. But the day of, I like to have some downtime. A nice lunch is important for me.","To me, in life, if there's, like, a rule, and I think it's ridiculous, then of course I'll circumvent that but also point out how ridiculous the rule is. Other than that, if I go to a concert, and my seat is Row G, Seat 12, I'm sitting in Row G, Seat 12. I don't care if I'm with five other friends, I'm supposed to be in Seat 12, that's my seat.","I tried snowboarding, and that scared the hell out of me.","My wife asked me if I ever thought I would ever retire from stand-up. And I thought about it, and I was like, 'No, because it's my job; it's what I do, and I enjoy it.' It's still the most challenging thing for me to do.","I love working with other actors and other people - you know, stand-up - it's lonely; it's just you out there and the audience. But it's fun working with other actors. I love doing that, too.","If I'm talking about something current, a current issue or something political, it's because I was able to read it when I was on the plane getting to the gig... a lot of it happens when I'm on the road because when I'm home, you're just mom, and that's it.","If a topic hits me, I'll start going on it. But you can't force it.","People are going to label you anyway, but the one that bugs me the most is when they say, 'One of the funniest female comedians.' There's s no 'funniest male comedians.' You're either a funny comedian, or you're not!"],"Wang Jianlin":["Real estate deals a lot with the government. It isn't like manufacturing, logistics, home appliances or the auto sector, which deal with consumers.","I am not a person who pursues luxury. I am not like those people who, once they have money, compulsively squander it or show it off.","China is a government-oriented economy. No one can say he can run his business entirely without government connections. Anybody who says that he or she can do things alone... is a hypocrite.","The basic principle is I command, and my employees carry it out immediately.","Don't ally your personal interests with the development of the company.","Remain close to government and away from politics. It means deal more with the authorities. And less with individuals.","If you are only big in China, you are only a local Chinese company.","I was born in a family with a strong military background, so I chose to be a soldier.","Wanda and Reliance are two of the largest private conglomerates in their respective countries. By joining our strengths together, we hope our cooperation will bring mutual benefits and great results.","China's movie industry is growing a lot faster than that of the U.S.","Foreign politicians don't have resources - or limited resources. It's useless dealing with them.","China has set its cultural industries as pillar industries.","Among the world's 500 largest companies, not one has completely relied on its own growth to develop.","Investing in Chicago property is just Wanda's first move into the U.S. real estate market.","The London property market has excellent investment opportunities.","Acquiring Sunseeker deepens Wanda's international influence and represents an important step forward for the development of the business.","Sunseeker is well placed to take full advantage of opportunities in China, one of the world's fastest growing luxury yacht markets.","Cultural industries will be the next engine for growth after real estate, and Wanda will make cultural industries our long-term focus.","I know Bo Xilai well. But our relationship was based on our work; we didn't have a personal relationship.","There are not many companies in China that dare to say in public, 'We don't offer bribes', or companies that operate only by market rules.","In setting goals and executing a strategy, Wanda is sophisticated. We have good systems and departments. If targets are not reached, a yellow light goes off.","The U.S., especially Hollywood, is so strong for film production.","If Wanda can control more than 20 per cent of the world's three most important film markets - the United States, Europe and China - then it will have an empire with great voice in the industry.","Chinese people today have strong demand for culture, but we need effective supply, and China needs innovative cultural products.","There's no single company in the whole world that has a big-scale production base and at the same time has screening and distribution channels. Wanda Group is the first one in the world.","The future of the world's film industry is in China because we have 1.3 billion people.","Chinese consumption, particularly high-end consumption, is booming."],"Wang Leehom":["I write and do all my arrangements on my Mac. And um, I use Logic Pro, which is a great software program.","The 'chinked out' style is a school of hip hop - that's the way I like to think of it - that incorporates Chinese elements and sounds.","I've never really had the urge to make an English album.","I've just had a wonderful time doing Chinese music, and it's been so rewarding for me. I feel like there's so much potential in mandarin music, and there's so much, you know, ground left to be broken.","I studied classical opera, so I was always singing in Italian and German and French.","The relationship between East and West needs to be and can be fixed via pop culture."],"Wang Shi":["It's easy not to bribe. But it's not so easy to keep a business running at the same time.","I used to work for an SOE. The wealth I created didn't belong to me. In other words, I was only managing money for the country and the people.","My next goal is for Shenzhen to become the model of environmentally-friendly and sustainable development.","No entrepreneur ever publicly admits to bribing, but few dare to openly claim they don't, either.","Global warming is my personal experience.","In the West, if a city faces financial difficulties, it'll go bankrupt. But in China, cities will be subsidised by the Ministry of Finance. So some small- and medium-sized cities aren't worried about going bankrupt. They figure the central government will help them out.","If you only get money, but you don't care about a thing, right or wrong, you cannot last. That cannot sustain you for the future.","As people's lifestyles have improved, they've become more and more sensitive toward animals. It's becoming a universal value, like Western classical music.","As an entrepreneur, one cannot just work and not say anything.","You must still stand up and say no when society is facing a backslide or a moment of danger."],"Wangari Maathai":["It's the little things citizens do. That's what will make the difference. My little thing is planting trees.","Until you dig a hole, you plant a tree, you water it and make it survive, you haven't done a thing. You are just talking.","We owe it to ourselves and to the next generation to conserve the environment so that we can bequeath our children a sustainable world that benefits all.","There's a general culture in this country to cut all the trees. It makes me so angry because everyone is cutting and no one is planting.","For me, one of the major reasons to move beyond just the planting of trees was that I have tendency to look at the causes of a problem. We often preoccupy ourselves with the symptoms, whereas if we went to the root cause of the problems, we would be able to overcome the problems once and for all.","It is important to nurture any new ideas and initiatives which can make a difference for Africa.","In Kenya women are the first victims of environmental degradation, because they are the ones who walk for hours looking for water, who fetch firewood, who provide food for their families.","When resources are degraded, we start competing for them, whether it is at the local level in Kenya, where we had tribal clashes over land and water, or at the global level, where we are fighting over water, oil, and minerals. So one way to promote peace is to promote sustainable management and equitable distribution of resources.","All of us have a God in us, and that God is the spirit that unites all life, everything that is on this planet.","I am working to make sure we don't only protect the environment, we also improve governance.","I don't really know why I care so much. I just have something inside me that tells me that there is a problem, and I have got to do something about it. I think that is what I would call the God in me.","In a few decades, the relationship between the environment, resources and conflict may seem almost as obvious as the connection we see today between human rights, democracy and peace.","African women in general need to know that it's OK for them to be the way they are - to see the way they are as a strength, and to be liberated from fear and from silence.","We are very fond of blaming the poor for destroying the environment. But often it is the powerful, including governments, that are responsible.","And so I'm saying that, yes, colonialism was terrible, and I describe it as a legacy of wars, but we ought to be moving away from that by now.","You can educate people on how to preempt their own conflict.","We need to promote development that does not destroy our environment.","It was easy to persecute me without people feeling ashamed. It was easy to vilify me and project me as a woman who was not following the tradition of a 'good African woman' and as a highly educated elitist who was trying to show innocent African women ways of doing things that were not acceptable to African men.","It's a matter of life and death for this country. The Kenyan forests are facing extinction and it is a man-made problem.","It would be good for us Africans to accept ourselves as we are and recapture some of the positive aspects of our culture.","You cannot blame the mismanagement of the economy or the fact that we have not invested adequately in education in order to give our people the knowledge, the skills and the technology that they need in order to be able to use the resources that Africa has to gain wealth.","But when you have bad governance, of course, these resources are destroyed: The forests are deforested, there is illegal logging, there is soil erosion. I got pulled deeper and deeper and saw how these issues become linked to governance, to corruption, to dictatorship.","Some say that AIDS came from the monkeys, and I doubt that because we have been living with monkeys from time immemorial, others say it was a curse from God, but I say it cannot be that.","I know there is pain when sawmills close and people lose jobs, but we have to make a choice. We need water and we need these forests.","Women are responsible for their children, they cannot sit back, waste time and see them starve.","That's the way I do things when I want to celebrate, I always plant a tree. And so I got an indigenous tree, called Nandi flame, it has this beautiful red flowers. When it is in flower it is like it is in flame.","I think what the Nobel committee is doing is going beyond war and looking at what humanity can do to prevent war. Sustainable management of our natural resources will promote peace.","When I first started, it was really an innocent response to the needs of women in rural areas. When we started planting trees to meet their needs, there was nothing beyond that. I did not see all the issues that I have to come to deal with.","When you think of all the conflicts we have - whether those conflicts are local, whether they are regional or global - these conflicts are often over the management, the distribution of resources. If these resources are very valuable, if these resources are scarce, if these resources are degraded, there is going to be competition."],"Wangechi Mutu":["Motherhood is the ultimate call to sacrifice.","I've always loved the idea that you think you know what you're looking at from a distance, yet when you come up close, it gets intricate and nutty and obscene and provocative.","I believe art is a connection, like passing on a flame.","When I'm making a collage, there are a lot of things about it that are violent.","For me, collages manage to - it satisfies all of my madness, like I'm able to make these obsessive things, but then I'm also able to make these very strong statements. I don't know what they mean to other people, but in my mind, they have a very strong particular resonance; there's sort of a power.","Gold and precious gems are, in many places, the one form of wealth a woman can use to protect and enhance herself within the elaborate structure of patriarchy.","There's a recycling mentality about my work.","I feel like I've spent a lot of time imagining home and thinking about a dream-like place, as opposed to a real place, because that's not what I was able to do, meaning go home or be home.","Equal rights for women and queer folks!","My work is often a therapy for myself - a working out of these issues as a black woman. And a way of allowing other black women to work through this kind of stigmatization as they look through the images and feel how distorted or contorted they might be in the public eye.","If something hurtful enters your body, you create something beautiful to protect yourself from it. That's my philosophy.","I do all I can to make my world a better place to live in for me and for my kids as well.","I'm big into multifunctional clothing.","My works tends to be erotic.","I really believe in dreaming and making things from nothing.","I would like to make work for my country, art which is innately Kenyan by being made in Kenya.","Our interest is in showing that homophobia is not part of the agenda for a new Africa.","I use femaleness as another lens, so I don't even think all my creatures are women; I just think that I bring out the femaleness in them.","Born Free is an idea that came from a place of deep respect for the delicate cycle of life. How incredible to be able to work with gifted designers who, as mothers, recognize what the devastating loss of a child could mean and how easily that loss can be avoided.","I feel that art is beyond language.","While I was a student at The Cooper Union, they discouraged too much of a focus on any one medium, and it helped me try new and different things.","I am inspired and affected by Aspen, the light and the landscape and the natural world.","I keep things moving along with a seriously loving, caring, and brilliant man, a fierce group of friends - and really strong coffee.","I hope my kids see imagination has power to change everything.","When certain things reach a tipping point, and you know people's lives are in danger, you have to decide that it's time to speak up, and you have to say something loud and clear.","If I don't have an ability to go the places that I have been invited to show at and to speak at and to feature my talent, well then, I am going to stay here in New York City and work my butt off.","So many a time, I would find myself stuck in my studio while, in another country, my exhibitions were opening and I was being celebrated.","I am fascinated by these ocean-grown folks. On the coast, there's all this cross-pollination of ideas. Someone thinks they saw something. One person's madness is reiterated by another, and a story is born. The rumour becomes a substitute for news.","I'm not a documentarian. I'm not a photojournalist.","The ocean is the source of life. We all come from there. I think about these one-celled creatures, and I think about the planet. It is related to my obsession with biology, even if it's only a layperson's obsession. The way I visualise what's at the bottom of the ocean is very much to do with how I feel when I'm swimming in the sea.","In 'National Geographic,' you always saw pictures of tribal Africa. And here I am, sitting in Nairobi in our suburban house, watching TV and thinking, 'Why is it always going to be these tribal people 'that are the ambassadors of our image?","I think there is something about countries and nations that is hard to define. And, in fact, that's probably why we create such massive boundaries - because it's so slippery where they begin and where they end.","We have to redefine what we mean when we say, 'Who are your people?' 'Where are you from?'","The medium of film is really wonderful because it can behave in the same way as collage and painting; it can be layered and non-literal.","I watched a lot of avant-garde films, like Maya Deren's work, and I love film's technical ability to do things that are impossible in real life. It's related to the way collage allows you to manipulate reality and the hierarchies that are inherent in our awful but amazing world.","I've always been curious about the things that I'm afraid to look at, that make me embarrassed or bother me.","I juxtapose and slice up reality and fiction quite easily. I'm aware that it is up for grabs and a powerful tool to explain how we take control.","I'm very much a person that believes that there's something that was introduced into Kenya and Africa as we know it that has made us despise our bodies.","Being taught to despise your body is being taught to perhaps admire someone else's body more than yours - being taught that your body is good for certain things and not for others.","Often, there's an emphasis in my work, and it's sort of the celebrating of the body.","I love magazines because they're so dispensable, and they're so quickly consumed. In that way, they're quite honest. They're unashamed about how small an amount of time they're trying to keep our attention.","I have this amateur side attraction to, and interest in, the sciences and biology and physics and evolution. Paleontology is of interest to me. I'm interested in the way these fields have helped us understand how we are human and why we are human.","We became Homo sapiens not that long ago, from the scientific perspective, and we've retained a lot of our beast nature. We've done all these amazing things in terms of our knowledge base and technology, and now we're flying around and using the Internet. But we're still very animalistic.","'Misguided Little Unforgivable Hierarchies' is a piece that I did around the time that I was very frustrated and angry with the fact that the U.S., where I live, had decided to pull itself into another war. I was really angry.","Some people get turned on by my work, and it sells, but what drives me is the process of making it.","Football has that wonderful gift of being accessible. You don't need much gear, a coach, or a lifeguard. You just need your imagination, strong legs, and a couple of friends, and it's a game.","There are ways to speak that can transform things, which has less to do with authority but is more about resourcefulness and ingenuity.","Beautiful things can happen when you act intuitively and instinctively in a moment of anxiety and do something radical.","One of the things I'm interested in is not just women but the female qualities that are present in everyone."],"Ward Churchill":["I am not a 'defender' of the September 11 attacks, but simply pointing out that if U.S. foreign policy results in massive death and destruction abroad, we cannot feign innocence when some of that destruction is returned.","If U.S. foreign policy results in massive death and destruction abroad, we cannot feign innocence when some of that destruction is returned.","They were targeting those people I referred to as 'little Eichmanns.'

Those are the simplest things. It goes beyond jewelry. It's every part of my life.","I like there to be some interest in every element of my life.","People who know me know that there's a light-hearted side, humour... But you could easily say I am cheeky.","I love my passport. I plan trips very last minute, so I always carry it with me.","My mission in life is to preserve craftsmanship.","I don't think men get enough flowers. A deeper pink or red peonies are my favorite. But I'll take anything, really.","I work with gold that holds our past and diamonds that see the future and rubies that long for love. It's just a way of telling a story.","I just want to create, and socializing is part of the experience. It might sound crazy, but I don't see myself in the jewelry business. It's an experience.","I work with gold that holds history, diamonds that see the future, and rubies that long for love.","Hold the door for a lady. Wait until a lady is out of the elevator.","I have always had a sense of curiosity and aspiration.","I travel a lot, and I hunt for fabrics, then I have the tailor make me something.","I do things because I enjoy it. That used to be my downfall, but now it's the upside.","I'm driven by history and our past. That's why I work in gold. It's in your veins. We've been lusting after gold since the beginning of time. God, glory, and gold.","I love driving in the city at night.","I think the reason for my fascination with craft is what it represents, what it means in our culture, what it means in our history and in humanity. It was the idea that you could go to your butcher to get something, you could go to your tailor to get this, and you could go to your cobbler to get that.","It took me a while to find myself.","Someone gives jewelry, and there's a bit of romance. If you buy it from a store, the store is trying to romance you. Even when I'm making the jewelry, I have to be romanced.","My go-to jeans are a straight, narrow cut from A.P.C. or BLK DNM.","I'm an American searching for some sort of parameters, a way of life - I'm looking for a slight formality, for a place where you can never be overdressed.","I'm a traditionalist with suits. It doesn't need extra pockets, and I don't want headphone jacks in my jacket. I appreciate designers who do different things, but for me, the most basic version of that item is what I want.","I'm surprised as anyone about where I've ended up. Maybe it's because I say yes to things.","If people want to think I'm an Indian prince, I don't want to dispel that notion.","My job is to put myself out there. It's beyond my control how I'm perceived.","My first workshop was in Rome, and that was the start of House of Waris. In a little magical atelier, a goldsmith, his apprentice, his stone setter - and that was where it began.","I made two rings for myself, and when I was in Los Angeles, I walked into a store called Maxfields, and they essentially bought them off my hands.","I wouldn't know how to think inside the box because I don't even know where it is. I wouldn't know how to do it any other way.","I am less comfortable saying I am a jeweller and more comfortable saying I am a story teller.","I take my work seriously, but I don't necessarily take myself seriously.","I love anything to do with history.","I have so many friends and obligations, and I want to go out and support people. But we eat at home.","I went through different styles but realized Ray-Bans are the classics. You can't go wrong with them. I explore and cheat on them occasionally, but I always go back to the aviators.","I like having a tailor everywhere because I am everywhere.","I'm a Sikh; it's part of my religious tradition to never cut my hair and keep it wrapped in a turban.","I primarily live in New York City, a place that is about constants, not letting up and not stopping.","My inspiration is love and history.","I don't drink coffee.","I create with my heart, so life and work inevitably intersect all too often.","I didn't choose acting. The universe did.","I need my fill of Indian home cooking.","I got no hate in me.","Supporting causes with whatever we do can be effective.","You don't have to become Mother Teresa to make an impact in the world.

I just don't want to be seen as fashion.","I spent the first five years of my life in Punjab, India, and then moved to New York.","I'm an explorer.","'Life Aquatic' was the first movie I did, and it's been an incredible adventure since then.","One of my favourite activities is eating."],"Waris Dirie":["I love life.

I was born a nomad, and I still am a nomad and always will be.","Personal style? I don't really believe in that. Whatever is comfortable.","If you can survive in the desert, you survive anywhere. I know more than anything life in desert. You can tell by looking at the dirt how long ago it rained, how hard it rained, how much water came through.

It's just so vain and so unreal."],"Warren Beatty":["Although Ronald Reagan was somebody I disagreed with on most ideological things, he was a friend of mine, and he was a very, very likable man. Ronald Reagan, for instance, was maybe more able to get the very rich to do the right thing sometimes.","I'd rather ride down the street on a camel than give what is sometimes called an 'in-depth' interview.","How can anybody hate nurses? Nobody hates nurses. The only time you hate a nurse is when they're giving you an enema.","You've achieved success in your field when you don't know whether what you're doing is work or play.","You know you're old when you're asked, 'Do you have hobbies?'","Being here allows me to make the case that not all aging, narcissistic movie actors whose children could be mistaken for their grandchildren necessarily act with the same motivation.","For me, the highest level of sexual excitement is in a monogamous relationship.","I believe if a private citizen is able to affect public opinion in a constructive way he doesn't have to be an elected public servant to perform a public service.","I don't want to run for governor, but I don't think anyone should put public service out of the question because that's not what a good citizen does.","I have a day job. I can make movies when I want to.","The definition of a Schwarzenegger Republican is a Bush Republican who says he's a Schwarzenegger Republican.","And then the conditions of safety - or lack of safety - for teachers in public schools, and the disparity between public schools and private schools is shameful.","Government is not show business.","My notion of a wife at 40 is that a man should be able to change her, like a bank note, for two 20s.","That's all gone, now, the old, Hollywood.","There's no point in making a movie just to be making a movie.","And the success of the union movement, historically, has always been to benefit all working men and women - not just people who belong to the union.","It's very clear you have to engage the public and say: You have to vote no on 74, no on 75, no on 76, no on 77. Those are the issues that Arnold pushing. And those are reactionary, Republican initiatives.","Lenin said that people vote with their feet. Well, that's what's happening. They either go, or they don't go. It's all politics. It's all demographics.","To say that people would cease to come to California if they would have to pay more taxes is to underestimate the advantages of being in California - mightily.","When I produce a movie - and I've produced a number of movies, unlike Arnold - yes, I'm frustrated when the union says you can't do this, you can't work past that hour, you've got to break for lunch. But ultimately, they're right. What they do is for everyone's benefit.","I was friends with President Ronald Reagan and he once said to me, 'I don't know how anybody can serve in public office without being an actor.'","Building a house is a lot like moviemaking. The attention to detail, the sense that you're doing something that has longevity.","Art is truth.","There's almost nothing that hasn't been said about me. But there's an awful lot that I haven't said. I don't talk about private things.","When you mutilate movies for mass media, you tamper with the hearts and minds of America.","Arnold has had his spokesman call me a crackpot. That was a mistake.","Marriage requires a special talent, like acting. Monogamy requires genius.","Movies are fun, but they're not a cure for cancer.","Organized labor, if they're doing a responsible job, is going to organize the pooling of small amounts of money to protect the interests of the people who are not rich.","I have been famous for a long time.","I would say that I wasn't so much afraid of marriage as afraid of divorce.","Character is plot, and casting is character.","But the Republican right-wing agenda, these people - Arnold and his patrons - felt it could be accomplished by circumventing the Legislature and spending money and organizing and giving sound bites.","My mother and my father were teachers. My grandmother and my grandfather were teachers. This is something I really know about. Even when I was a kid, it was a profession my father couldn't stay in, because he couldn't make enough money.","To denigrate the union movement in this way is to denigrate the right and the ability of people who are not rich to organize and to accomplish things together.","When I saw Arnold say that he didn't need a union, because people in his position don't need it, I thought, this is a very naive way to present yourself. It's also kinda dumb about making movies. It doesn't realize how the union movement even helps the star.","I think I've been lucky enough not to have to do movie after movie after movie for financial reasons, so I've been able to live life and also make movies. I didn't have to grind them out. I could go long periods where I was living life rather than tripping over cables.","For years, Warner Bros. was trying to get me to make a movie about Howard Hughes.","I left Northwestern University after a year and was in New York playing piano in a little bar on 58th Street, and I didn't know whether to go back.","I've never talked to anyone writing a book on me. I've had so much written about me that is made up, usually something that seems silly enough or weird enough to get remarked upon, and it's pretty much all fiction.","I sometimes feel I have met everyone he ever met, but I never met him. I am afraid to say I have always been - the word I would have to use is - amused by Howard Hughes.","When I came to Hollywood, I would take the opportunity to get to know George Stevens or Willy Wyler or Billy Wilder or Freddie Zinnemann. David Lean I got to know, of course, in London. And David Selznick and Darryl Zanuck, not to mention Jack Warner, and Sam Goldwyn was actually very, very nice to me.","I was studying with Stella Adler, who was a great, great teacher who encouraged me to be an actor. I had thought I would just write or direct or whatever. I wasn't thinking very much of Hollywood. I was thinking only of the legitimate theatre. But then I changed.","If I had done some of the movies that I was offered as an actor - and very good movies, by the way, and some of them big moneymakers - I don't know that I ever would have taken what was the concentration or the time to do the movies that I produced. 'Reds' is a good example, but 'Shampoo' is also an example, and so was 'Heaven Can Wait.'","I'm slow at everything I do.","I think I've had 16 books that purport to be a biography of me. I've never cooperated with someone.","I don't want to be mushy about it, but having four kids is definitely the best thing that has ever happened to me, and each kid is, to me, more fascinating than any five movies.","I actually knew Adlai Stevenson and Jack and Bobby Kennedy.","It's hard to misquote someone who doesn't say anything.","By attracting attention to yourself, you distract people from the movie. Ideally, you like a movie to speak for itself. You don't describe a song before you sing it or tell about a painting before you show it. You don't reveal the recipe before you serve the dish.

Truly profound and original insights are to be found only in studying the exemplary.","The manager has his eye on the bottom line; the leader has his eye on the horizon.","Leaders must encourage their organizations to dance to forms of music yet to be heard.","Leaders are people who do the right thing; managers are people who do things right.","The manager accepts the status quo; the leader challenges it.","The most dangerous leadership myth is that leaders are born-that there is a genetic factor to leadership. This myth asserts that people simply either have certain charismatic qualities or not. That's nonsense; in fact, the opposite is true. Leaders are made rather than born.","People who cannot invent and reinvent themselves must be content with borrowed postures, secondhand ideas, fitting in instead of standing out.","There are two ways of being creative. One can sing and dance. Or one can create an environment in which singers and dancers flourish.","The manager asks how and when; the leader asks what and why.","Create a compelling vision, one that takes people to a new place, and then translate that vision into a reality.","The manager has a short-range view; the leader has a long-range perspective.","One of the best teaching experiences Ed Schein and I had when we were teaching at MIT in the 1960s was inventing a course on leadership through film.","The factory of the future will have only two employees, a man and a dog. The man will be there to feed the dog. The dog will be there to keep the man from touching the equipment.","Find the appropriate balance of competing claims by various groups of stakeholders. All claims deserve consideration but some claims are more important than others.","Trust is the lubrication that makes it possible for organizations to work.","Becoming a leader is synonymous with becoming yourself. It is precisely that simple, and it is also that difficult.","You need people who can walk their companies into the future rather than back them into the future.","A great director or leader knows his people, creates a great team, and then makes a great movie that can influence millions more than the readers of his column.","Learning options will indeed mushroom for business students and leaders, but it will take prudence and shrewdness to find and utilize the best option.","Leaders should always expect the very best of those around them. They know that people can change and grow.","There is a profound difference between information and meaning.","Leadership has become a heavy industry. Concern and interest about leadership development is no longer an American phenomenon. It is truly global. Though I will probably be in less demand, I wanted to move on.","Taking charge of your own learning is a part of taking charge of your life, which is the sine qua non in becoming an integrated person.","I've become more and more aware of the promise and struggle to teach the global mind nowadays because I use every chance I get to ask faculty and administrators of management education programs why we don't offer at least one course - not even required, just an elective - on the world's religions.","The original and brilliant idea of an MBA was the opportunity for students to study the theory and application of business and management principles.","The primary goal of management education was, as originally conceived, to impart knowledge that could be applied to a variety of real-world business situations.","Most regular, two-year MBA programs provide both experience and the capacity to link together the essential elements of management such as finance, marketing, organizational behavior, and operations.","Learning in a face-to-face human community, as humans have evolved to do over hundreds of thousands of years, may always be the ideal - especially in an endeavor that is as relationship-driven as business.","Good leaders make people feel that they're at the very heart of things, not at the periphery.","Failing organizations are usually over-managed and under-led.","I wanted the influence. In the end I wasn't very good at being a president. I looked out of the window and thought that the man cutting the lawn actually seemed to have more control over what he was doing.","Leaders know the importance of having someone in their lives who will unfailingly and fearlessly tell them the truth.","How can we educators claim credit for understanding, let alone teaching, the 'global mind' without a single course on the impact of religion on every day life?","Specialized management courses are useful but should come well after the complexity of management and business are understood.","As my blog editor knows all too well, I wasn't all that keen to enter the blogosphere world."],"Warren Buffett":["Someone is sitting in the shade today because someone planted a tree a long time ago.","Price is what you pay.

And it went to zero. And I gave about $400 million worth of Berkshire stock, which is probably now worth $400 billion. But I've made lots of dumb decisions. That's part of the game.","In the 20th century, the United States endured two world wars and other traumatic and expensive military conflicts; the Depression; a dozen or so recessions and financial panics; oil shocks; a flu epidemic; and the resignation of a disgraced president. Yet the Dow rose from 66 to 11,497.","The best thing I did was to choose the right heroes.","Beware of geeks bearing formulas.","We simply attempt to be fearful when others are greedy and to be greedy only when others are fearful.","You only have to do a very few things right in your life so long as you don't do too many things wrong.","Wall Street is the only place that people ride to in a Rolls Royce to get advice from those who take the subway.","Our favorite holding period is forever.","If past history was all there was to the game, the richest people would be librarians.","The only way to get love is to be lovable. It's very irritating if you have a lot of money. You'd like to think you could write a check: 'I'll buy a million dollars' worth of love.' But it doesn't work that way. The more you give love away, the more you get.","When you combine ignorance and leverage, you get some pretty interesting results.","You do things when the opportunities come along.

For to a degree, people read the press to inform themselves - and the better the teacher, the better the student body.","If anything, taxes for the lower and middle class and maybe even the upper middle class should even probably be cut further. But I think that people at the high end - people like myself - should be paying a lot more in taxes. We have it better than we've ever had it.","The rich are always going to say that, you know, just give us more money and we'll go out and spend more and then it will all trickle down to the rest of you. But that has not worked the last 10 years, and I hope the American public is catching on.","I just think that - when a country needs more income and we do, we're only taking in 15 percent of GDP, I mean, that - that - when a country needs more income, they should get it from the people that have it.","You have no ability, if you're a financial institution and you're threatened with criminal prosecution, you have no ability to negotiate.","I sent one e-mail in my life.

I think there is a range of matters that might be discussed between NATO and Russia that can provide a mechanism for talking through these issues, a way to give reassurance on these issues.","It will be undertaken, of course, in the June or July summit, and then to bring NATO closer to Russia or vice versa is a way to move toward integration - toward the integration of Europe.","We've had some fairly intensive discussions leading up to these meetings between NATO and Russia, preparing for them, and it's going to be a very important six months for NATO.","You know, it's been President Clinton's dream that we'll have finally a fully integrated Europe; and the steps that NATO will take to expand to the East, that's a commitment.","Both sides were supposed to release all their prisoners, those were unconditional.

I lived there until I was 13. It was a marvelous advantage to grow up in a small town where you knew everybody.","I'm very much in favor of focused responsibility, and so in the main areas that I'm worried about, I try to have a single person who is basically the key person in that area.","I've got many close friends, but there's an awful lot about friendship that is not demonstrative in my case.","It was helpful to have the American troops there in great strength.

They're a very powerful country.","We have a human rights interest. Then there is the immigration problem. The human-rights violations have caused people to take to boats and flood not only the United States, but other countries in the region, creating great instability.","We see considerable strain in Russia, and that's obviously a matter of concern to us. It's in the very strong self-interest of Russia to continue on the reform path.","We've had it very clear to the Bosnians that our obligation to equip and train their forces is completely conditional on the foreign forces being gone.","We've worked with President Yeltsin.

It certainly has not been in my self-interest to defend men. I've gone from being quite wealthy, when I was defending women, to being quite poor defending men.","In fact, the socialization gives us the tools to fill our evolutionary roles.

Disposable in war; disposable in work. We need warriors and volunteer firefighters, so we label these men heroes.","Feminists who say that I switched sides because I am an opportunist should know that exactly the opposite is true. It's cost me a lot of money. I've gone from being well-to-do to being $70,000 in debt. I have done something self-destructive financially. I could only do it because I don't have to support a wife and child.","Let's face it: men do a lot of things in the workplace that women just don't do.","The problem is that Americans care more about saving whales than saving males.","Men have not stacked the decks against women.","All women's issues are to some degree men's issues and all men's issues are to some degree women's issues because when either sex wins unilaterally both sexes lose.","When women criticized men, I called it 'insight'... When men criticized women, I called it 'sexism' and 'backlash.'","If a man belittles a woman, it could become a lawsuit. If women belittle men, it's a Hallmark card.","Women are the only 'oppressed' group that is able to buy most of the $10 billion worth of cosmetics each year; the only oppressed group that spends more on high fashion, brand-name clothing than its oppressors; the only oppressed group that watches more TV.","I realized that women's liberation is men's liberation, too.","Is there discrimination against women? Yes. There's no denying that the old boys' network is alive and well.

With poor social skills, the boys feel anger at their fear of being rejected and self-loathing at their inability to compete.","And we reduce almost all male-female problems by working on both the female and the male. And that usually means having both sexes take responsibility.","In America and in most of the industrialized world, men are coming to be thought of by feminists in very much the same way that Jews were thought of by early Nazis. The comparison is overwhelmingly scary.","Men don't oppress women any more than women oppress men.","Men's competitive team sports focus on the balance between individual achievement and team achievement with the emphasis on team achievement.","Throughout my life I have always been amazed that people couldn't listen to other people, that they couldn't hear their best intent, that there seemed to be an enormous need to demonize.","I don't have children that I've lost in a bitter custody dispute. But I see an enormous wound in kids due to a lack of their dads.","A man perceives himself as owning and being owned by a woman.","I'm not saying that men make better fathers than women do mothers.","There are 80 jobs in which women earn more than men - positions like financial analyst, speech-language pathologist, radiation therapist, library worker, biological technician, motion picture projectionist.","While girls average a healthy five hours a week on video games, boys average 13. The problem? The brain chemistry of video games stimulates feel-good dopamine that builds motivation to win in a fantasy while starving the parts of the brain focused on real-world motivation.","Those who call me an opportunist are following the old rule: If you can't attack the data, attack the person.","Men have the influence and power in business and politics. It is the mother who can make the child's bedtime earlier, take away desserts or ground the child.","If women had to promise to provide for a man for a lifetime before he removed his veil and showed her his smile, would we think of this as a system of female privilege?","If you are a woman, you might feel torn between logical agreement and emotional resistance. Why? It seems like a simpler solution to blame men for the pay gap than to engineer your own bridge to higher pay.","I definitely agree with choices for women, but I do not agree with choices for women when they eliminate choices for men. Rather, I think that the sexes need to make choices that lead to the maximum amount of win-win for both sexes.","A 2001 survey of business owners with MBAs conducted by the Rochester Institute of Technology found that money was the primary motivator for only 29% of women, versus 76% of men. Women prioritized flexibility, fulfillment, autonomy and safety.","When women hold off from marrying men, we call it independence. When men hold off from marrying women, we call it fear of commitment.","And then in 1956 or 1957 my family went over to Europe and I moved over with them, and immediately people in Europe thought my perspective on that issue was 100% correct.","Feminists have confused opportunity with outcome.","For example, the equivalent of a woman being treated as a sex object is a man being treated as a success object.","I don't think there's anything that is a greater area of discrimination against women today than the fact that nowhere in the world is there a female role model in team sports that more than half of a general audience would recognize.","I started to get very well recognized in the early seventies as the only man in the United States who had been elected three times to the board of NOW in New York City.","It evolved from my experience in the fifties, growing up during the McCarthy era, and hearing a lot of assumptions that America was wonderful and Communism was terrible.","Men are often a lot less vindictive than women are, because we are rejected constantly every day.","Nobody really believes in equality anyway.","One can make a case that says that since 85% of children being brought up in single family homes are being brought up by women that about 85% of elementary school teachers should be males to balance out the feminization that the boys and girls receive.","Our main reasons for fearing males having sex with males is that you really had to construct a more powerful social role to keep men in their place than you did to keep women in their place.","So we've moved from an era when women's biology was women's destiny to today, which is an era in which men's biology is men's destiny.","The Myth of Male Power dealt much more with the political issues, the legal issues, sexual harassment, date rape, women who kill, and those issues were very much more interfaced with the agendas of feminism.","The only men who aren't in fear of women's reactions are usually men who aren't born or who are dead.","You could make a case that women addicted men to their sexuality and then withdrew their sexuality until we provided them with a source of income.","Companies like I.B.M. have offered women scholarships to study engineering for years, and women engineers routinely get higher starting salaries than men.","My wife's income allowed me to do what I really loved. I realized that women's liberation is men's liberation, too.","I've gone from being quite wealthy, when I was defending women, to being quite poor defending men.","I'm an awfully loyal friend. Once I've started a relationship with someone, it's like they are syrup and I'm a pancake. Their syrup gets into my pancake, so to speak.","The five different areas in which boys are in crisis - education; jobs; emotional health; physical health; and fatherlessness - are handled by different portions of the government.","Once boys' and men's challenges are clear, the question 'why now' quickly becomes 'why didn't we see this sooner?' The answer? Virtually every society that survived did so by socializing its sons to be disposable.","Now, since I'm a husband and father, discrimination against women isn't just political, it's personal.","I found that women entrepreneurs earn 50% less than their male counterparts.","Without husbands, women have to focus on earning more. They work longer hours, they're willing to relocate and they're more likely to choose higher-paying fields like technology.","Men are fair, and they have learned not to personalize anger - they can disagree with you and argue to the bone, but afterward they still consider you a nice person with whom the underlying human relationship need not be altered.","Men are likely to be quite generous, especially financially.","A man's primary fantasy is access to a variety of attractive women without the fear of rejection.","I've always been motivated to stop people from doing dysfunctional things.","Financial analysts make a lot more than accountants.","Is there discrimination against women? Yes, like the old boys' network. And sometimes discrimination against women becomes discrimination against men: in hazardous fields, women suffer fewer hazards.","After years of research, I discovered 25 differences in the work-life choices of men and women. All 25 lead to men earning more money, but to women having better lives.","I'm a great supporter of women who take risks and don't make victimhood into an art. It's not good for women, and it's not good for men. Too many men put all their emotional eggs in one basket - a woman's basket.","Men move through a much different process before commitment than women do.","Men rarely worry about using or being used because all relationships work that way. A man perceives himself as owning and being owned by a woman. 'Use' is a dirty word only when there's an imbalance in the relationship.","Without children, men have more liberty to earn less - that is, they are free to pursue more fulfilling and less lucrative careers, like writing or art or teaching social studies.","The male corporate model is built on a man's greater willingness to be a slave of sorts - especially once he has to provide for children.","The key to wealth is not what we earn. It is in what is spent on us.","For blacks in our society, victimization may be a true issue. But it isn't a true issue for women. Neither men nor women are victimized. The true issue, that I try to point out, is that both sexes suffer restricted roles.","I define power as 'control over one's life.' A balanced life is far superior to the male definition of power: earning money someone else spends while he dies sooner.","The average full-time working male works more than a full-time working female.","The women themselves say they're far more likely to care about flexibility. The men say, 'I'm far more likely to care about money.'"],"Warren G. Harding":["America's present need is not heroics but healing; not nostrums but normalcy; not revolution but restoration.","I don't know much about Americanism, but it's a damn good word with which to carry an election.","I don't know what to do or where to turn in this taxation matter. Somewhere there must be a book that tells all about it, where I could go to straighten it out in my mind. But I don't know where the book is, and maybe I couldn't read it if I found it."],"Warren G":["A lot of people in my family have high blood pressure. Dre told me I better start hitting the gym... so I took his advice.","Death Row had a lot of artists. They had Snoop, the Dogg Pound, the Lady of Rage, and there was other artists that was also on the label, so it was a big list and a long wait. I didn't want to wait that long, so I started branching off and doing my own thing.","I had an apartment on Long Beach Blvd and San Vicente in Long Beach, California. That was the apartment I done 'Regulate' in. I had all my equipment set up in the bedroom, a vocal booth in the bathroom and in the closet, and that's where we created it. I had an MPC 60, a Numark mixer, and a Technics 1200, and a ton of records.","For 'Regulate,' I was at home, and I came up with it. I was listening to Michael McDonald's 'I Keep Forgettin'.' It was a record that I always loved, from being a kid and my parents playing it when they had their company of friends over. It was a record that just stuck in my head, and it just felt good.","If I'm not putting out music, I'mma be producing for everybody. I got an artist named Mike Slice. He's nice, and he's real good. I'm doing a bunch of production for all the artists in the industry because I'm as much as a producer as I am an artist.","Just to know that someone who's 15 years old is listening to my music and the work that I've done - it's definitely a blessing.","I would provide more opportunities for the kids of urban communities to go to school and learn trades - to get more jobs to take care of their families.","I'd end all of the wars. I'd bring all of the troops home and make sure that they're taken care of for life - for what they did protecting our country.","My thing is, I don't get in nobody's business or nothing like that or try to bash anybody for what they do. I've got cousins who are gay. To me, there's just no difference. We always chill and have family functions the way we always have. It's not a problem.","Dr. Dre, my oldest brother, he paved the way for me and Snoop to get a chance to get into the studio. I asked him to show me how to work the MPC-60... I was about maybe 17, 18, right around there.","It just feels good to know the work I did, people like it and love it - and continue to like and love it. It makes me feel real good that, after 20 years, 'Regulate' is still in heavy rotation all over the United States and all over the world.","Seeing Dre looking all cut up and in shape made me want to get myself together and look right, too."],"Warren Giles":["I met Powel Crosley at an All-Star Game in 1935. He was familiar, of course, with our winning record at Rochester. We seemed to hit it off immediately, and the following year, when he was looking for a successor to Larry MacPhail, he thought of me.","You must prune dead or dying wood.","People take sides on political things, such as the Vietnam War. War is immoral and war is wrong, but I don't think the clergy ought to bring it before the Church.","My first interest in baseball is the welfare of baseball itself. My second is the Cincinnati Reds, and my third is Warren Giles.","People frequently ask me if adverse criticism bothers me. I've had a lot of it, and I have been able to shrug most of it off.","I didn't make any friends in New York by insisting on moving the league headquarters to Cincinnati. The fact was that my son Bill was in school. His mother had passed away, and I didn't want to take the boy away from his school and to a strange city.","A newspaperman said, 'You have to have a team in New York.' I replied, 'Who says you have to have a team in New York?' What came out in the papers was a headline that said, Giles Says, 'Who needs New York?' I confess that quote bothered me, and there seemed to be no way to dispose of it. It was repeated again and again."],"Warren Kole":["I think I'm at a place where I haven't really been encountered by anyone overtly strange. But people think they know me.","I was a sophomore in college, and I did an industrial video about how to use the Internet - that dates me! It was with John Turturro, somehow they had gotten John Turturro to do this thing, and I was so excited and so nervous I probably drank 10 cups of coffee that morning.","I never wanted to give up my given name. I'm proud of it, but the only problem was that no one remembered it. It was just a little too awkward, and they mispronounced it so frequently.","The ironic thing is I took Kole from a family name - we had a vote and they had a few names, but Kole won - and getting it spelled with a 'K' is a constant correction, too. I'll never not be Warren Blosjo; it's just my stage name."],"Warren Littlefield":["At the end of Season 1 of 'Cheers', it was the lowest rated show in all of network television... So we turn to 'Bill Cosby'; when he came to Thursday night, he just exploded. And once the audience was there, we said, 'Hey, by the way, we also have this other great show. It's called 'Cheers'.'","Two hundred channel choices in most homes certainly gives you the world of choice. And so slicing it, dicing it, and offering someone their favorite thing - by the way, if it's not good enough, make it yourself and post it.","I believe America wants and needs the shared experience of television. We far too often see in crises how television brings us together.","In the history of pilot reports, 'Seinfeld' has got to be one of the worst of all time.","Innovation comes to you from creators who do have a vision and a passion, and that is how we succeeded.","I fought to make a multiple series commitment with John Wells.","One way in which 'Friends' did resemble 'Seinfeld' is that it really found its audience over the summer of 1995 in reruns. That's when the main title song, 'I'll Be There for You', by the Rembrandts, exploded, too.","A 'Friends' shoot night could extend well into the small hours of the morning.","The writers and actors on 'Friends' were notoriously particular about what made it onto the air.","NBC's pilot season of 1994 is legendary in the business. In a world where failure is commonplace, we midwifed the birth of both 'Friends' and 'ER'. While 'ER' came essentially out of the blue, we'd been casting around for a 'Friends'-like show for some time at the network.","I was the network president. I thought I knew everything.","Audiences want and need a shared viewing experience.","What Must-See T.V. was all about was one network, one night, for one decade. And a third of the country would come and watch Must-See T.V. And you didn't dare go to work the next day, because if you hadn't watched, you would be left out of the conversation, that water-cooler conversation.","Our D.V.R.s make up the schedule of the shows that we're passionate about. You want Jon Stewart? You've got it. Your D.V.R. will give that to you, as opposed to making the destination and the choice to spend that evening with a network.","My last series was on A.B.C., a one-hour called 'My Generation'. Critics liked it. I was on for two weeks, and that was a tough one.","'A Different World' didn't have the blazing success that 'Cosby' had, but it was on for seven seasons, and we got a lot of awards, and a lot of faces came out of that show and have had great careers.","There's no reason that there has to be a fringe network that illuminates an urban or a multiethnic experience.","Creating things sometimes is difficult.","My job was to find interesting material that would give us a quality television show.","While 'Friends' was about a 20-something population and what they were going through, they were also dealing with issues with their family.","'Friends' played in this territory of being funny, and then also just grabbing your heart. And not afraid of that. It was a comedic soap opera. Not being afraid to have an audience feel something, laugh and cry, was quite extraordinary and quite wonderful.","When you're still in the broadcast business, you're still trying to reach tens of millions. You're trying to still aim for a broader audience, and I think that's a more difficult task to spread yourself across that audience, connect with them, as opposed to a very, very small, pinpointed audience. Difficult to do.","You don't know what the country is ready for unless you're pushing that envelope, and I was told that I couldn't develop 'Will and Grace'.","I loved growing up in Montclair... I think it's grown and changed and embraced change.","When we developed the 'Seinfeld' show, we took a bet on Jerry Seinfeld, who was not a household name. But Jerry had a voice. He was appearing on 'Late Night', on 'The Tonight Show', had some commercials out there, his voice of observational comedy, looking at the world around him, that voice was really starting to come into its own.","When in life do you get a black and white printout that says this is what you should do? It just doesn't happen."],"Warren Mitchell":["Comedy comes from conflict, from hatred.","I knew that I did not have to buy into society's notion that I had to be handsome and healthy to be happy. I was in charge of my 'spaceship' and it was my up, my down. I could choose to see this situation as a setback or as a starting point. I chose to begin life again.","In case of doubt, do a little more than you have to.","I enjoy being Jewish, but I'm an atheist... I hate fundamentalism in all its forms. Jews, Catholics, Baptists, I think they are all potty and capable of destroying the world."],"Warren Moon":["My legacy isn't about what I did playing football, but how I use the opportunities that came from playing football.","In football, it's the ultimate team sport. You have to have good people around you as a quarterback for things to happen.","I've always tried to lend my support to worth while causes, and I feel you should use your celebrity to help with worldwide causes and help them gain exposure.","I'm proud of the fact that besides being known as a successful former football player, I've also worked hard to establish myself as a successful businessman, network broadcaster, sports & entertainment executive and philanthropist.","Charles Barkley, Clyde Drexler and I used to argue for hours about who the best athletes are. I thought football players were better overall.","Basketball players want contact to get a foul called. Slaps on the wrist and bumps on the shoulder are big time to them, and they don't like that. In football, you get that all the time. The whole mental makeup is different.","Quarterback is not a position that you come in having not played it your whole life.","I love basketball players for what they do for their size - so graceful.","The CFL made me a more versatile QB because of all the things you had to do once you got on the field. And if I wasn't as versatile as I was, I wouldn't have been as successful in all the different offenses that I was in, in the NFL.","My biggest hero was Roman Gabriel, who was the QB of the Rams, and Roger Staubach. Those were the two guys I tired to emulate when I was little.","To me, being in your prime means playing your best and feeling your best, too.","There are so many bad influences out there. I don't care if a kid is rich or poor, if he lives in a million-dollar house or the ghetto, he is going to find some sick things on the street. And if we don't clean it up soon, we're all going to pay the price.","Kids tend to look up to sports figures and entertainers, probably more than they should, but I've tried to use that in a positive way.","When people talk about the great quarterbacks, it's almost exclusively the guys who have won Super Bowls. There have been some very good ones who hardly get mentioned because they never won the big one. I don't know if that's fair, but that's the way it is.","That's the one regret I have in all the years that I've played professional sports, that I didn't win a championship in the N.F.L. And that's why you play on any level of team sports: you want to win a championship as part of a team.","I never thought I would be the oldest quarterback in the National Football League at one point, not in a million years. I never thought I would play as long as I did, either, seventeen years from start to finish, with stops in Houston, Minnesota, Seattle, and Kansas City.","Even though my mother had told me growing up that, 'If you win, nobody cares what color you are,' that wasn't necessarily true in the N.F.L.","It was about being wanted, it was about winning, and it was about my passion for the game. I just loved it. I absolutely loved to compete and to step out onto that football field with my teammates.","I'm about a 160, 170 bowler so I feel like I'm pretty good - I'm average, but I don't stink, you know?","When I was coming up as a kid, there were programs that kept me out of trouble and on the straight and narrow in South Central Los Angeles, and I always felt that when I got to a stage where I could provide similar opportunities to kids then I would do that.","Throughout my career, I was never able to relax; I always had to go on the field with another responsibility. I felt like I was playing, not just for my team, but for my race."],"Warren R. Austin":["As we take our places in the General Assembly and at the Council meetings, let us begin all our work in the name of God, for the solution of all our problems is a spiritual one.","To craftsmanship we shall add statesmanship in the capitol of peace."],"Warren Rudman":["Well, it's taken a long time to get the Department of Homeland Security established. It's taken a long time for the Congress to decide how much it wanted to fund.","We tend to pay attention to that which is the most current on our radar screen.","We have to make a determination of what the minimum standards are for police, fire and emergency services in all of America's major cities. Once we determine that, then we can decide what the funding is.","Washington, D.C., has a much greater risk than Manchester, N.H. They both need some level of funding, but they ought not to be done per capita. Congress is to blame for some of this.","This may sound trite, but bad things happen to good people, and when you're facing terrorism, natural disaster, you can have every wonderful plan in place, but I am a realist.","The two things that could have been better is number one, to get major military force into the community almost immediately to make sure that there was law and order. Number two, we had enough helicopters to airlift food into the centers of population and those places.","The president's very right about one thing: When you have a disaster of that scale, whether it be natural or a terrorist attack, there's only one part of our entire government, state or local, that is equipped to handle it, and that's the U.S. military.","The other thing about FEMA, my understanding is that it was supposed to move into the Department of Homeland Security... and be what it was, but also having a lot of lateral communication with all those others involved in that issue of homeland security.","Significant steps have been taken since 9-11 to protect out country here at home, but much remains to be done, Americans from across the political spectrum must come together to develop the next phase of our efforts to counter global terror.","It was a bad idea, because I think that any government reorganization has to come in relatively small bites, or else you get indigestion.","If you have a major disaster involving hundreds of thousands, or in this case millions of people, whether it be a natural disaster or an act of terrorism, the first 72 hours are going to be totally chaotic no matter what you plan to do.","If there were a major earthquake in Los Angeles, with bridges and highways and railroads and airports all shut down and huge buildings collapsing, I don't care how much planning you do, the first 72 hours is going to be chaotic.","Everyone is going to have to step up to the plate.","And they will tell you unequivocally that if we have a chemical or biological attack or a nuclear attack anywhere in this country, they are unprepared to deal with it today, and that is of high urgency.","And if you do all you can, that's all you can ever do."],"Warren Spahn":["What is life, after all, but a challenge? And what better challenge can there be than the one between the pitcher and the hitter.","Hitting is timing. Pitching is upsetting timing.","A sore arm is like a headache or a toothache. It can make you feel bad, but if you just forget about it and do what you have to do, it will go away. If you really like to pitch and you want to pitch, that's what you'll do.","A pitcher needs two pitches, one they're looking for and one to cross them up.","Twenty games is the magic figure for pitchers - .300 is the magic figures for batters. It pays off in salary and reputation. And those are the two things that keep a ballplayer in business.","When I throw a ground ball, I expect it to be an out, maybe two.","You don't just throw the ball - you propel it."],"Warren Spector":["For me, the cool thing is doing things that could only be done in gaming.","In cartoons, in movies, time passes differently. There are flashbacks and flashfowards.","Whatever adults don't understand, because they didn't grow up with it, is the thing they're going to be afraid of and try to legislate out of existence. It happened with videogames, it happened with television, it happened with pinball parlours and rock and roll.","We set up a situation and let you interact with it and see the consequences of your choice. That's what gaming does.","Gamers are everywhere, coming in all ages and genders, and developers have grown up, too.","Kids, adults, men, women, everybody has a relationship with Mickey Mouse.","I want my little corner of the world where I get to make games where you're not trying to win or lose; you're not trying to get a higher score - you are having unbelievable amounts of fun as you learn about yourself and the world. That's what games can do!","Whether it's as the hero of an adventure story, as teacher and friend, as icon on watch, shirt or hat - everyone knows Mickey Mouse.","I think there's always room for more innovation and new things.","Oswald is an interesting character. Disney lost the rights to him in 1928 to Universal, who was distributing the cartoons and basically handed him over to Walter Lantz.","If we're going to reach a broader audience, we have to stop thinking about that audience strictly in terms of teenage boys or even teenage girls. We need to think about things that are relevant to normal humans and not just the geeks we used to be.","Gamers both demand and deserve novelty. They need something new. As a game developer, one of my rules is there will be at least one thing in every game that I worked on that no one on the planet has seen before.","Finney is about the best writer of time travel stories ever, and I adore time travel stories - have to make a time travel game someday!","I've loved cartoons all along. Most people outgrow that when they hit 10 or 12, I guess, but I never did. I'm not sure why.","On the small scale, 'Ico,' I think, actually delivered a small new thing: holding a character's hand and really feeling like your job is to rescue this person, and establishing a personal connection.","I have never made a game that wasn't explicitly about empowering players to tell their own story.","I do not believe in the concept of good and evil in my personal life, in the real world. I just don't believe it. I never try to judge.","I want content that is relevant to my life, that is relevant to me, that is set in the real world.","Dude, I turn into a six-year-old when I come to Disneyland. It's amazing. My eyes glass over and my blood pressure goes down. I'm just like everybody else. I turn into a big kid when I come here. It's the happiest place on earth, right?","I've made plenty of violent games in my life. I play violent games. They don't affect people in the way that a lot of people think they do. They just don't. It's demonstrably true that they don't, and anybody who thinks they do is just not thinking.","As far as the timing, well, I'd write that off to luck as much as anything - I happened to be out looking for a development deal, and Disney happened to think my team and I might be the right people to make a Mickey Mouse game.","I think plenty of games - from 'Thief' to 'Zelda' - have shown that sneaking around can be fun.","Here's the thing: I left Ion Storm and Eidos in the spring of 2004 frankly because I felt out of place at that company.","I was an independent developer and started Junction Point in January of 2005.","Before I got into electronic games, I was making table-top games.","I wrote my master's thesis on cartoons!","Everyone at Junction Point has been inspired by the creative folks at Pixar and Disney Feature Animation to make 'entertainment for everyone.'","My greatest joy is seeing parents and kids playing Disney 'Epic Mickey' together, handing the controllers back and forth, helping each other out.","Ray Harryhausen's 'Sinbad' picture was the first film I remember seeing. I was two years old when it came out, and it changed my life forever. I had nightmares about dragons and stuff for years - and loved it!","It's about players making choices as they play, and then dealing with the consequences of those choices. It's about you telling your story, not me telling mine. It's about you.","The heart of the gameplay is still about choice and consequence, which is what I've been doing since the '80s.","I like Disney stuff. No-one looks at 'Toy Story' and says,' Oh, that's just for kids.' Why is it that games can only appeal to a certain audience, but movies and books - I mean, how many adults read 'Harry Potter?'","The Disney archives, it's 84 years of history. The one way in which I feel I'm a kindred spirit with Walt Disney is that neither one of us ever throws anything away. He never threw anything away.","I make M-rated games for adults, you know, with guys wearing sunglasses at night and trench coats.","I've got a PowerPoint deck that I use for internal presentations, and there's a slide on it that asks, 'What percentage of your game is combat versus exploration versus puzzle solving versus platforming,' and I refuse to answer that question.","I'm a big believer in pushing things too far and forcing people to pull you back.","I will not support any game that doesn't express what I think is worthwhile.","We're not going to do a Facebook game aimed at 35-year old women about farming.","I gotta do what I think is right, and if enough people like it, I'm a winner. And if they don't, I'll open a bookstore.","Seriously, I don't know if people would really tell you this. But in my dream world, the people who work for you would say, 'Wow, I didn't know I could do that until I started working with that guy.'","Honestly, there have been some pretty good Marvel games, but I don't think there's ever been a great one.","My first encounter with video games was pretty conventional. I was travelling with my parents - we used to take long cross country trips in the United States every summer - and we went into a restaurant where there happened to be a Pong machine, and I was... a lot of quarters went into that Pong machine, let's just say.","I started playing video games, and in 1978 I discovered Dungeons & Dragons and started game-mastering and writing my own adventures and creating my own worlds.","I don't want to make games for 12-year-olds. I have no interest in that. I haven't been 12 in a long time.","I've always said - I've been making games for twenty years, and from the first day I got in this business, I've been saying, 'All I have to do is sell one more copy than I have to, to get somebody to fund my next one.'","Hey, if we didn't overcharge for our product - guess what - people wouldn't have to buy used games.","Used games allow more people, specifically younger people, to become game fans because of the lower price point.","I have got no problem with used games. I've bought plenty of used games.","The reason our games generate so much revenue is because we're stupid enough to charge $60 for a box or $50 for a download or something. You need used games because most people can't afford those prices.","I conceived the original 'Deus Ex' and was the project director on the game.","If anything, game development is even more of a team effort than making a movie, so for individuals to get credit for making a game is absolutely insane.","I don't care much about hardware. Nintendo games are some of the best games in the world, and from a more graphical standpoint, the Wii can't do what a PS3 or 360 can do.","Once we can do Pixar-quality graphics rendered in real time with interactivity, I could see games costing $200 million to make, and all of a sudden you have to sell a lot of games just to break even, so I'm a little worried someone's going to do that.","I think the power of the platforms is outstripping the size of the audience. We can't charge $150 for a game. And when the best-selling game of all time has sold only 20 million copies at $60, do the math!","$200, 300 million games, I'm a little scared about that; there aren't a lot of companies that have the resources or the courage to spend that much.","I have never been assigned a game, I have never made a game I didn't want to make. I've never done anything just to make somebody some money.","Every game has to teach you how to walk, run, talk, use.","For most developers, that kind of situation - a player figuring out how to do something that the designer didn't intend - to most developers, that's a bug. For me, that's a celebration.","Unfortunately, the rights to 'System Shock' trademark and copyright are both up in the air.","I would love to take 'Ultimata Underworld' and literally update the graphics.","I remember on Deus Ex there was one programmer - Alex Durand, a guy who still works for us - he decided he was going to get through the game without ever using a weapon. I would never think to do that. And that's fine.","The basic idea for what became 'Epic Mickey' began at the Disney Think Tank.","Ideas are nothing. They're irrelevant. If you think your idea is so important, you're doomed. The reality is if you don't like one idea, I've got 299 more. If I tell you my idea, and you can execute better against that idea than I can - great; I get to play a terrific game.","The reality, for me at least, is that the finest recreation of a paper game, played on computer, pales in comparison with the actual, face-to-face experience.","In papergaming, players can look at a character sheet of their own creation and see all of their skills, right there, in black and white.","The fact is most computer roleplaying games that offer a zillion highly specialized skills end up with nine-tenths of a zillion skills that every player quickly realizes aren't worth the experience points to buy.","My wife, Caroline Spector, and I pitched some comic ideas to various publishers back in the '80s, but nothing ever came of it.","Let me tell you, writing comics is as hard as anything I've ever done - for me, at least. I'm now officially in awe of guys who can crank out multiple books a month and maintain a high level of quality. Comics are completely different than any other medium I've dabbled in.","The 'DuckTales' ensemble is clearly critical. There's the core set of characters - Scrooge, Webby, Launchpad, Huey, Dewey and Louie... Plus there's Gyro and Duckworth and Mrs. Beakley and so on. The cast is huge.","I don't even make multiplayer games much, so dealing with multiple characters is something new for me - or, rather, something I've had to recall from my days as a roleplaying adventure designer where the party was everything!","I'm a Nintendo geek, so I'm a pretty big Nintendo fan.","The Wii U is pretty cool, and the thing that I'm most intrigued about it is it's the first gaming platform that actually is exploiting the second screen.","When you're dealing with a new platform, the real trick is just getting the game running.","The concept of emergent gameplay is really exciting. That's when players are really crafting their own experience. So if you're clever and creative, you can do things that even developers of the game didn't know were possible.","I used to teach animation history classes at the University of Texas, and I wrote my master's thesis on cartoons. I just love cartoons.","From a gameplay standpoint, I've said for years that hero, fiction, and tone have nothing to do with the idea that choices have consequences. And that's really what I'm interested in. I care about you showing how clever and creative you are.","I've done a pretty good job of hitting 18-34-year-old males, and not such a good job of reaching kids. Disney has done a great job of reaching kids, but maybe not the 18-34-year-olds. I figure I can learn a lot from Disney, and maybe, I don't know, they can learn a lot from me.","Third-person camera is way harder than I even imagined it could be. It is the hardest problem in video game development. Everybody gets it wrong. It's just a question of how close to right do you get it.","I was lucky enough to go to an all-boys prep school in upstate New York that had a film program, so we had access to 16mm Bolex cameras, Nagra sound recorders, Arriflex cameras. We even had an Oxberry animation stand!","The transition from the original Xbox to the Wii wasn't a big deal for my team. The business hadn't changed fundamentally.","I was amazed at how the life of a freelancer differed from running a remote studio for another company. I thought I knew what I was doing in 2004 when I left Eidos because I had run Ion Storm Austin, which was my own independent studio. I had run a business unit inside Origin, but being part of a startup is crazy.","The only thing I insist that everybody do is there has to be a basketball court in every game I do, and - with one exception, I let them get away with it once - you can actually shoot a ball through the basket in every game I've made.","In the electronic game world, I know I have a reputation for doing the cyberpunk thing, and for doing the serious epic fantasy thing, but if you go back to when I was a kid, I've been a Disney fan all my life.","Anyone who says they want to make a game that becomes a cult classic is kinda screwy, right? I mean, you want to reach the largest audience you can.","I said to myself as Junction Point embarked on the Epic Mickey journey that, worst case, we'd be 'a footnote in Disney history.' Looking back on it, I think we did far better than that.","The Junction Point journey is over. To all those who've asked, or want to ask, I'm sad but excited for the future.","I've got friends who are literally working alone on indie games that have no prospect of profit or commercial success. I've got guys working on iPhone games.","The more people who game, the better for everyone.","I have no interest in guys who wear armor and swing big swords.","I have been the last space marine between earth and an alien invasion. I really just don't need to go there anymore.","I kind of get a next-gen game machine, but competing for the home entertainment business? We'll see how that goes.","I'm a huge fan of e-books, but the more I buy and download, the more I worry that someone could just take them all away from me.","We live in a world of virtual goods where none of us own the 0s and 1s. What are you going to do?","The only morality I'm interested in is the morality between your ears, between each player's ears, because that's the interesting thing to me.","I often get painted as the guy who's trying to tell other people what to make and what to like, and that's really not my goal, but I believe so passionately that games can be more than a lot of people think they can.","People perceive games as being for kids, and I think that perception is going to change. Time is going to take care of that. I mean, we've already won. Games have won; it's inevitable."],"Warren Stephens":["Underwriting is probably the smallest part of our business.","It's difficult to make your clients understand that there are certain days that the market will go up or down 2%, and it's basically driven by algorithms talking to algorithms. There's no real rhyme or reason for that. So it's difficult. We just try to preach long-term investing and staying the course.","Owning equities is an essential part of anyone's portfolio. You just can't ignore it over time. It's going to add the real pop to anyone's overall performance.","One of the industries we follow very closely is the trucking industry. They would love if today there was an option for them to run their fleets on natural gas, because of the price disparity between oil and refined diesel - which they almost exclusively run on now - and natural gas.","We've always been modestly leveraged, and we've never believed in a great deal of leverage on either our private equity business or on our investment banking business. And I think it really goes back to my uncle and dad growing up in the Depression and just seeing what happened to people who were overly levered.","We're certainly interested in maximizing our return and doing it - we're interested in maximizing our return, but we're also interested in doing it over a long period of time and in doing it in a way that never endangers the firm from a survivability standpoint.","What we prefer to do is operate our investment bank in a way that is like what investment banks used to be, which is a middle man - someone who is here to match people who need capital with people who have capital - and not position ourselves at the center of that by taking big positions on a trading stance.","In our experience, what we have found is the rare commodity is a good management team. And good management teams manage through good and bad cycles and manage to grow their business over a long period of time.","We don't think of ourselves as a regional investment bank. We think of ourselves as merchant bankers with clients all over the country."],"Warren Weaver":["Science attempts to analyze how things and people and animals behave; it has no concern whether this behavior is good or bad, is purposeful or not. But religion is precisely the quest for such answers: whether an act is right or wrong, good or bad, and why.","Science is not gadgetry.","We keep, in science, getting a more and more sophisticated view of our essential ignorance."],"Warren Zevon":["Well, first of all, let me say that I might have made a tactical error in not going to a physician for 20 years. It was one of those phobias that really didn't pay off.","Enjoy every sandwich.","And I think it's safe to say that the single very impressive figure to me was Merle Haggard.","I missed jazz, kind of. And by the time I came to it in life, it was too intimidating to enjoy thoroughly.","I'll sleep when I'm dead.","You had to go to a different part of town from where I was to get Muddy Waters singles. I had him on singles.","Yeah, I don't like, um, I'm not interested in rock 'n' roll piano. I find it a little grating.","Well, I was interested in playing the piano from as early as I can remember.","Well, I don't think it ever did, but in the early '60s I got interested in folk music.","The primary one being, like I said, I don't like rock 'n' roll piano.","That's my only active wish. I think if I sang like Don Henley, this would be a lot more agreeable business.","So I guess I had, I think they tell me I had, about three years total of piano lessons, off and on.","Recording at home enables one to eliminate the demo stage, and the presentation stage in the studio, too.","Piano is like drudgery.","My memory is not even what most people's is, much less what it oughta be for a discussion like this.","My first album is like a terrible John Hammond album, with drums.","My father was a boxer, though. So, I have a particular interest in Ray Mancini, I think.","Mutineer is the first album of mine without a demo stage.","It took me 10 years to realize that I don't know 'em, 10 years to realize that it's possible to learn them, then another 10 years to learn how to do things.","I'm not a big jazz fan.","I wish I sang better.","I remember certain lines and whose they are.","I played a lot of real normal, straight sessions.","I mean, I haven't been completely lacking in some enjoyment of Chuck Berry or Buddy Holly. But I just didn't pay attention to that period of music, obviously.","I loved Hendrix. I mean, really, really loved him. As if he were one of the great classical composers. And he was. That's how I saw him.","I have no guitar technique.","I had a good guitar, and I was a young, young kid.","I don't like piano solos.","I don't learn so good, no matter how good the teacher is.","Glenn Gould was my hero. Glenn Gould was my idol. I loved him.","Everywhere I go, I have my little Steinberger, and I like it very well.","Dylan doesn't have to make Blonde On Blonde every time.","Dylan can do no wrong.","Duncan Aldrich has been my partner in most recording projects, and touring projects, for the past decade.","But there's a thin line between songwriting and arranging.","But I can't say that I didn't like John Hammond's performances often better than the originals."],"Warwick Davis":["I find vacuuming very therapeutic, but I hate ironing. I usually have no shirt on while ironing, because I'm ironing it, and I end up burning my chest.","The world worries about disability more than disabled people do.","When I go from a role with heavy prosthetic makeup, which I've done quite a bit of as well, and then do a role where I'm not wearing any, I have to be conscious of toning everything down.","My parents armed me with an amazing sense of humor, and it's what you need when, well, it's what anyone needs in this world.","There's nothing better than going to the movies and going into another world, and forgetting about everything that's happening outside.","As you get older, you can suffer from painful hips, and our joints wear a lot quicker than for people of average height.","To me that's part of my working day, and I would never refuse a job where I'm under several hours of makeup, because as an actor, I enjoy performing. It's about the creation of the character and the art to me, not about being comfortable and how long it all takes.","Nothing's better than coming away from a film when people don't even recognize you, because you've undergone a total transformation.","It's interesting to see what people are saying about me. I like keep up with the latest rumors! A while back there was a rumor that I was going to do a film with Demi Moore about the takeover of Commodore computers!","I mean, I would say I get five or six e-mails every day from people asking, \"Is there going to be a Leprechaun 6?' It's probably the most asked question besides, 'Is there going to be a Willow II?'","When I came up with the character of Wicket for 'Return Of The Jedi', which was my first film, I was a kid of 11 years old, and I basically was playing a very young Ewok.","I wouldn't say one is easier or more difficult, but when you're inside a costume and a mask, you have to endure heat - and, often, difficulty seeing. The vision is not very good in a mask. And you have to cope with that, as well as trying to think about this character.","When I go from a role with heavy prosthetic makeup, which I've done quite a bit of as well, and then do a role where I'm not wearing any, I have to be conscious of toning everything down. Because when you're wearing prosthetic makeup, of course, you have to really move your face a lot more to convey things through the makeup.","But things such as 'Harry Potter', all I can do is shape my character, seek the director's approval on that, and basically take it from there. Professor Flitwick in 'Harry Potter', I kind of defined how I saw him from reading the book, and luckily that matched up with the director's vision.","I would like to play an average guy. I would have loved to play opposite John Candy in a movie. That was my dream for a long time, and sadly, now I can never realize that. But I'd like to do comedy.","My life is quite physical anyway. When you are three-foot-six you kind of have to climb stuff now and again, and you find yourself in quite precarious situations just to manage in what is quite a big world.","My parents are both average size. For them to have a child who was very, very different and very, very small must have been incredibly hard.","My dad instilled in me a great sense of humor. I wasn't bullied at school because my outward attitude was confident, and that helps.","I wouldn't change a thing about my family.","When I was born in 1970 with a rare genetic disorder called spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita (SED), medical science wasn't what it is today and my mum and dad were treated terribly by the medical profession.","In a costume, you need very exaggerated body language - as you say, sort of mime-type skills.","If you stood me in a costume next to a computer graphic of the same-looking character, I think there would be a difference. And many movie fans I've spoken to would rather see an actor in a costume than CG.","I do a lot of public speaking and presentations and I'll always start with a self-deprecating joke to make everybody feel comfortable with my size because there can be hang-ups and anxieties.","The way people deal with me - they'll go overboard in trying to be politically correct and make a mess of it. Everyone's so worried about what they're saying to everyone else, that they don't talk very much.","I don't want to be just somebody short who happens to act. I hope my legacy will be Warwick Davis, Actor.","I run Willow Management, which is the biggest agency for other short actors. We look after performers who are either under five feet and over seven feet tall.","I've found that it's actually more of a disability to be tall than short. I have no problem fitting into plane toilets etc, and the adaptations made for wheelchair users - such as the lowering of bank machines - work for me as well.","As a film actor, you don't often get that opportunity to meet with your audience and take your applause on stage.","I'm an actor, and when I close the door at home I'm kind of off-duty.","And I feel that filmmakers ought to be careful with the use of 3D. Because if you look back over the decades, you see that 3D has come and gone for I don't know how many years now.","My wife is short, and my two kids are also small.","Very obsessed fans do ask actors to attend their weddings.","People who are short, they're often portrayed as the victim.","I don't crave fame. I mean, it's nice to be recognized. It is useful.","If you just did a horror tone throughout an entire movie you almost, as an audience, can get a little bit used to it. But if you're laughing one minute and, you know, somebody's doing something quite horrific the next minute, it's a little more shocking.","When you do films that have multiple sequels, you develop a character for a film.","You've got to love acting and that's true for me. I love the idea of getting on stage and getting in front of a camera.","So, I think I'd be grateful for the next job. I always am. And I always consider everything I do to be the last thing I do."],"Washed Out":["Texture is very important. Just the feel of everything. It's not always about recording everything in pristine quality and having everything mixed where it's absolutely perfect. It's more about a vibe.","In your imagination, you can perfect things in a way you can't do in your everyday life.","For the longest time, I was trying to be DJ Shadow, I think. But I slowly developed my own style. It was trial and error, for sure.","There are certain sounds that have a loaded past. Like the sound of a harp, if you go back to old movies, represents a dream sequence; it transports you there.","I'm entirely self-taught, which I think is both a blessing and a curse.","For me personally, I'm always writing from what's happening in my emotional life. Even without thinking about it a lot of the time, it comes out in the songs that I'm writing.","I never wanted to just press play on some DJ set and let the lights do all the work. I value old-fashioned performance a little more than that.","Obviously, I never want to make the same record twice. I want to keep moving forward. That's the real challenge, I think.","It is easy to get an interesting loop to happen, but it becomes a collage when the song and loop are constantly changing.","I've struggled with depression before. For me, music was always a very positive way to will myself out of that situation.","I have a small studio set up in my house in Athens. I'll wake up, have a nice breakfast, and I won't surface until dinnertime. I'm very domesticated in that way.","Escapism or nostalgia, for me, is not about having a terrible life and trying to get away via imaginary ideas or something.","I try to stay on a pretty normal schedule of nine-to-five.","It's a weird dynamic - I guess there is a fine line between hope and sadness. Sometimes you can be feeling both at the same time.","The types of melodies I tend to write kind of have this bittersweet quality; they're meant to be uplifting but kind of have this melancholy vibe to it.","I personally love the record-making more than the actually performing and travelling. It's funny, the drastic shift in lifestyle that comes with it. It certainly satisfies my more adventurous side, but it leaves little time for contemplation and all of that.","There are things I can accomplish in the studio via manipulation on the computer or some kind of effect that are nearly impossible to do live. On the flip side, there are some things that happen live that can't be pulled off in the studio.","I try to be as optimistic as I can. I feel like that's the beautiful thing about art and music. It can take you places, and they can be a positive influence. A very soothing influence. Honestly, I feel like there's enough pain and terrible things that happen in life. That's beautiful thing in art, you can really idealize things.","I'm very happy in my life, but I do feel that music has a power to transport you to places or to beautiful moments in your past.","One of the great things about music is how it can take you places.","My parents live out in the middle of nowhere, in the middle of this peach orchard. It's actually Peach County, one of the largest peach-growing counties in Georgia. It's very rural, and there is nothing much going on, so I guess that's had a big influence on everything as far as just not having much to do.","I do try to structure everything in a way that's very much like a pop song. I try to keep the arrangements really simple, just to make everything essential.","I want people to make sense of what I'm talking about.","Over a year's time, I felt like I squeezed in five years of touring experience, which was a really huge help moving forward.","I don't think I would change anything. I think we've done a fairly good job of remaining sane and making the right decisions.","I never want to make a complete, 180 reactional record. I wanted a connection to what I've done in the past but still move forward and evolve.","I get very bored easily. I'm a child of the Internet or whatever; I want more and more of new and interesting things.","Ultimately, what interests me is using exotic sounds in my songs.","I definitely enjoy the kind of magic that happens being on stage with a group when everything's working. The vibe when that's happening gets even better if the audience is involved and you can feel that interaction. That's something you don't get with your headphones on in a studio; it's much different.","For the most part, the real work is done in the songwriting stage and recording; the next step is presenting to people.","I've always, in some way, incorporated sampling into my work.","I normally start at the computer with something really simple like a four-bar loop of a drum sample or a bass line. And then I just start adding layers of synthesizers.","I just make up lyrics off the top of my head. A lot of times, there's a phrase I really like, and I kind of build the song around that.","When I look back at the record and listen to it, I can sort of see where I was at when I was making it - these brief little moments, different places I was at emotionally.","I was definitely the kid in the back of the class with his head down the whole time not wanting to speak up and say anything.","I definitely enjoy my time by myself - and that's kind of the weird thing about touring; you're kind of constantly surrounded by people - but I actually do enjoy going out and doing things and being around people.","I have a little basement studio set up here at my house, and I do probably 80 percent of the recording here on my own. With multi-tracking technology, I can play various parts on top of one another.","I took piano lessons when I was really young, like five years old, and I didn't really enjoy that very much. It was kind of too strict. So when I was probably 11 or 12, I started playing guitar and just kind of taught myself.","The way I work is by infinitely playing a very simple loop over and over, and then I start layering things.","When you work this intensely on something, the recording process becomes a bit like cabin fever. I shut everything out and, for a while, I totally lost perspective. To an outsider, I imagine the whole recording process sounds like torture.","Where I grew up in the middle of Georgia, hip-hop is king, and on Friday and Saturday nights, local DJs do mixes. It's a great mix of local stuff and then some of the bigger hits and remixes of the hits, and it just has this nice flow with a dirty-South sound to everything.","I just have the normal ringtone, unfortunately.","Making music is pretty much the only thing I can do.","We lived in Atlanta for a couple of years, and had a lot of fun, but my best work happens when I isolate myself. It's all about turning inward.","For some, being involved in a scene is a great thing because the social element can drive creativity. For me, though, it's never really been like that. It's the opposite. I've always had this instinct to escape.","I'm without a doubt a producer first. The lyrics happen towards the tail-end of the process, mainly because they're more stream-of-consciousness. It's very rare that I'm going to tell a really concrete story.","Honestly, I've just made music so long by myself, in some ways I don't feel I'm a very good collaborator.","The beautiful thing about working with new instruments is that you sort of approach it with a fresh perspective.","When we're back home, I feel pretty domesticated.","I'm not a very technical musician at all.","Being outside is a loose theme on 'Paracosm.' Acoustic-sounding instruments have that warmth to them that is really important to communicate. It was really important for me to tell a story - my favorite records have a narrative feel.","When I think about making 'Within,' it was not a very fun experience at all.","I don't think it's an exciting thing to move back in with your parents.","Something on mainstream radio is very in your face with the vocals. I tried that, and it just doesn't feel like Washed Out. It's got to have that haziness to it.","I've always written pop songs. I tend to take inspiration from more experimental genres, like ambient music, but at the root of the song, it's verse-chorus-verse.","I love listening to pop radio.","I listen to a lot of different kinds of music, and I feel like I can pull ideas from practically anything. You name it - I'll probably like it.","The way that I sing is very mumbled-together, and so I guess I'm kind of stuck with it now.","I know of some guitar-based rock bands that refuse to record anything that they can't play live. But some of the best stuff I come up with are studio-based performances - bringing out whatever accident I had in the studio and building a song around that.","I do have the personnel that we use in the back of my head when I'm working, but I also don't want to limit myself.","My general taste is towards the melancholy.","Maybe in the future, you'll be able to understand what I'm saying. I'm going more for an atmospheric vibe in my songs. And I really don't want to ruin the illusions people may create for themselves.","I don't really write all that well with others.","I was gonna work in a university, but no one was hiring.","I like an even-keeled, slow-paced job.","I felt like I was building this world brick by brick with each layer of instrumentation I was doing. I could see it growing in some ways. I feel like most writers feel the same way. You're almost living inside of this magic world that you're building.","It's very hard to find perfection in your life. But in the art world you can do that.","I lived in a neighborhood where there weren't many kids. I had a couple sisters, but I was very much a loner. Whatever film I had seen that day or that week, I would completely find myself in that world.","I remember at one point, with a previous release of mine, I stumbled upon a shareware site, and the total number of downloads was in the thousands, maybe the hundreds of thousands. But there's no doubt that the Internet and that kind of sharing has been a huge benefit for the band.","I come from a background of hiding everything behind a computer.","My philosophy is generally to keep things as simple as possible.","I think '80s pop music subconsciously informs what I'm doing.","My first big influences were more hip-hop based - people like DJ Shadow and Four Tet.","I'm not the most technical producer, so the weird mixes and blown-out sound happen naturally.","When I first started writing songs, I never intended on singing. I didn't really consider myself a singer at all. I was just kind of recording the demo vocals as a holding place until someone else came and sang.","The Washed Out thing happened really quickly, and I wasn't really actively promoting the songs. I didn't think of them as any more than demos, really, and it sort of became a thing on its own.","If a band or artist isn't tweeting or writing posts on Facebook every day, there can be this kind of mystique built about them, and I find myself retreating from the spotlight more and more.","My music is a personal thing, and I feel like if I talk too much about the songs, or if there's too much of my personal life out there, it ruins it.","I'm very much a fan of having something tactile you can hold.","I was at a slight disadvantage in that I had never played in bands or done any performances before, and that's just as important as writing, recording, and putting records out. It's been a lot of hard work, balanced with a lot of pinch-myself moments of touring in crazy parts of the world.","I didn't realise how much I ate Mexican food, like tacos and burritos three times a week, until I came to Europe and couldn't find any.","Travelling is really great for giving you tons of ideas, but it's really hard to actually record anything on the road.","Obviously, you want to honour the sound of your music, but I'm definitely open to trying new things and making myself use a different palette of sounds.","A lot of the early Washed Out material was done on a couple of synthesizers that did most of the work, but that's the great thing about synths - you can recreate sounds or make an entire record with just one piece of gear.","The one sound I think of when I think about dreaming is the harp glissando, which is this really atmospheric run up and down the scale that's really dreamy.","In some ways, I feel like I've always dabbled in nostalgia. It's just what I do; it comes naturally.","It's like a painter with various layers of paint. I start with a drum loop and add keyboards, and then melodies start to take shape. The vocals happen later. I've never really done therapy before, but it's a form of therapy. Everything else falls away.","The music is at this weird intersection of dance music and indie music. It's not quite dancey enough to do a full-blown DJ set, and it wasn't quite rock enough for a rock band. But I guess it's what makes us unique - drawing from a lot of different influences.","The entire making of 'Within and Without' was a series of experiments and trial by error. When I started writing, I didn't have a strong idea of what the record was going to end up like.","A lot of the things I was doing on the first couple Washed Out releases was very naive.","I naturally like that dreamy, shoegazey sound on my vocals. A lot of reverb helps, and so do a lot of delay effects on everything.","Any musician - I would say 99% of musicians - needs some help along the way. Most people, even if they're self-produced, have someone else mix it, or they'll have someone else master the record. Inevitably, it's like somebody else's personality being put into your art.","When I'm not touring, I hardly ever leave my house. Part of it is I get to do what I'm most passionate about, which is work on music and make new songs.","I put some songs on the Internet back in 2009 - that's kind of how everything started with Washed Out. I had never really planned on being in a band or anything like that. It was kind of a hobby I did on my own, just recording music.","You hear ten seconds of a song, and you know it's OutKast. There's a strangeness about it because it's catchy, but it's not just pop for the sake of pop. They're pushing the envelope.","The thing that's good about music-making software like the DAW-kinda systems is that they're all generally the same; the kind of interface is normally laid out in a similar way. Depending on the program, the sounds might be quite different, but they tend to all have a drum machine or synthesizer or a sampler."],"Washington Allston":["The only competition worthy of a wise man is with himself.","Distinction is the consequence, never the object of a great mind.","Never judge a work of art by its defects."],"Washington Irving":["There is a sacredness in tears. They are not the mark of weakness, but of power. They speak more eloquently than ten thousand tongues. They are the messengers of overwhelming grief, of deep contrition, and of unspeakable love.","A kind heart is a fountain of gladness, making everything in its vicinity freshen into smiles.","Little minds are tamed and subdued by misfortune; but great minds rise above them.","Great minds have purposes; others have wishes.","Sweet is the memory of distant friends! Like the mellow rays of the departing sun, it falls tenderly, yet sadly, on the heart.","They who drink beer will think beer.","There is a serene and settled majesty to woodland scenery that enters into the soul and delights and elevates it, and fills it with noble inclinations.","Love is never lost. If not reciprocated, it will flow back and soften and purify the heart.","There is in every true woman's heart, a spark of heavenly fire, which lies dormant in the broad daylight of prosperity, but which kindles up and beams and blazes in the dark hour of adversity.","The tongue is the only tool that gets sharper with use.","The idol of today pushes the hero of yesterday out of our recollection; and will, in turn, be supplanted by his successor of tomorrow.","Acting provides the fulfillment of never being fulfilled. You're never as good as you'd like to be. So there's always something to hope for.","The easiest thing to do, whenever you fail, is to put yourself down by blaming your lack of ability for your misfortunes.","The natural effect of sorrow over the dead is to refine and elevate the mind.","Those men are most apt to be obsequious and conciliating abroad, who are under the discipline of shrews at home.","He is the true enchanter, whose spell operates, not upon the senses, but upon the imagination and the heart.","Kindness in women, not their beauteous looks, shall win my love.","A father may turn his back on his child, brothers and sisters may become inveterate enemies, husbands may desert their wives, wives their husbands. But a mother's love endures through all.","A tart temper never mellows with age, and a sharp tongue is the only edged tool that grows keener with constant use.","One of the greatest and simplest tools for learning more and growing is doing more.","Rising genius always shoots out its rays from among the clouds, but these will gradually roll away and disappear as it ascends to its steady luster.","There is in every woman's heart a spark of heavenly fire which lies dormant in the broad daylight of prosperity, but which kindles up and beams and blazes in the dark hour of adversity.","Nothing is enough for the man to whom enough is too little.","There is certain relief in change, even though it be from bad to worse! As I have often found in traveling in a stagecoach, that it is often a comfort to shift one's position, and be bruised in a new place.","It is not poverty so much as pretense that harasses a ruined man - the struggle between a proud mind and an empty purse - the keeping up of a hollow show that must soon come to an end.","There is never jealousy where there is not strong regard.","Age is a matter of feeling, not of years.","Temper never mellows with age, and a sharp tongue is the only edged tool that grows keener with constant use.","The sorrow for the dead is the only sorrow from which we refuse to be divorced. Every other wound we seek to heal - every other affliction to forget: but this wound we consider it a duty to keep open - this affliction we cherish and brood over in solitude.","Christmas is a season for kindling the fire for hospitality in the hall, the genial flame of charity in the heart.","I am always at a loss at how much to believe of my own stories.","An inexhaustible good nature is one of the most precious gifts of heaven, spreading itself like oil over the troubled sea of thought, and keeping the mind smooth and equable in the roughest weather.","Some minds seem almost to create themselves, springing up under every disadvantage and working their solitary but irresistible way through a thousand obstacles.","Indeed, there is an eloquence in true enthusiasm that is not to be doubted.","Honest good humor is the oil and wine of a merry meeting, and there is no jovial companionship equal to that where the jokes are rather small and laughter abundant.","A woman's whole life is a history of the affections.","There is a healthful hardiness about real dignity that never dreads contact and communion with others however humble.","Young lawyers attend the courts, not because they have business there, but because they have no business.","Who ever hears of fat men heading a riot, or herding together in turbulent mobs? No - no, your lean, hungry men who are continually worrying society, and setting the whole community by the ears.","The natural principle of war is to do the most harm to our enemy with the least harm to ourselves; and this of course is to be effected by stratagem.","Marriage is the torment of one, the felicity of two, the strife and enmity of three.","I've had it with you and your emotional constipation!","A sharp tongue is the only edge tool that grows keener with constant use.","After all, it is the divinity within that makes the divinity without; and I have been more fascinated by a woman of talent and intelligence, though deficient in personal charms, than I have been by the most regular beauty.","The land of literature is a fairy land to those who view it at a distance, but, like all other landscapes, the charm fades on a nearer approach, and the thorns and briars become visible."],"Wassily Kandinsky":["Color is a power which directly influences the soul.","Color is the keyboard, the eyes are the harmonies, the soul is the piano with many strings. The artist is the hand that plays, touching one key or another, to cause vibrations in the soul.","The sound of colors is so definite that it would be hard to find anyone who would express bright yellow with base notes, or dark lake with the treble.","Lend your ears to music, open your eyes to painting, and... stop thinking! Just ask yourself whether the work has enabled you to 'walk about' into a hitherto unknown world. If the answer is yes, what more do you want?","The deeper the blue becomes, the more strongly it calls man towards the infinite, awakening in him a desire for the pure and, finally, for the supernatural... The brighter it becomes, the more it loses its sound, until it turns into silent stillness and becomes white.","Everything starts from a dot.","The artist must train not only his eye but also his soul.","Every work of art is the child of its age and, in many cases, the mother of our emotions. It follows that each period of culture produces an art of its own which can never be repeated.","The spirit, like the body, can be strengthened and developed by frequent exercise. Just as the body, if neglected, grows weaker and finally impotent, so the spirit perishes if untended.","Each color lives by its mysterious life.","A painter, who finds no satisfaction in mere representation, however artistic, in his longing to express his inner life, cannot but envy the ease with which music, the most non-material of the arts today, achieves this end. He naturally seeks to apply the methods of music to his own art.","The nightmare of materialism, which has turned the life of the universe into an evil, useless game, is not yet past; it holds the awakening soul still in its grip.","There is no must in art because art is free.","Our epoch is a time of tragic collision between matter and spirit and of the downfall of the purely material world view.","To create a work of art is to create the world.","An empty canvas is a living wonder... far lovelier than certain pictures.","With few exceptions, music has been for some centuries the art which has devoted itself not to the reproduction of natural phenomena, but rather to the expression of the artist's soul, in musical sound.","How can German music not be represented by an article?"],"Watkin Tudor Jones":["The only real things in life is the unexpected things. Everything else is just an illusion.","It's super dope when you connect with something personally.","I've only been to jail once, and I didn't get my tattoos there.","I'm a Ninja. I'm not scared of death.","We don't really think that much about what we do; it's just fun.","Live shows are pretty much like the center of the storm... where the power comes from, the most raw experience. That's the juice. That's where we hit the hardest.","Cape Town is a weird town. There's a mountain, and the sea, and a little city tucked into the side of the mountain.","I just wanna hear my own voice.","My favourite book in the world is 'Neuromancer' by William Gibson.","All Die Antwoord music, on a weird level, is like relationship music.","Whenever we do stuff with Die Antwoord, it's kind of like... I made a lot of music before this group that I'm kind of bored of and forgot about, and everything with Die Antwoord I really love. It's the first time I've made music where, even the first songs we made, I really adore all those songs, and I'm proud of them.","With a film, you can get into it and love it. With music, you can listen to over and over again, but with music videos, they're like this short little stab.","I wanna be the biggest pop group on the planet.","I would categorize Die Antwoord as pop music: extreme, futuristic pop music.","It's super trippy coming to America because we know everything about it - from music and film. I know what a Southern accent sounds like; I know what a New York accent sounds like.","People react to 'District 9' and Die Antwoord on the same level.","Ever since I was a teenager, my style around girls has been kinda like 'laid back in da cut.'","I made a clean version of 'Enter the Ninja' that my mom can listen to.","Zef is the underbelly of the Afrikaans culture, but it also, like, is Afrikaans culture.","I was, like, in a rap gang. I loved rap, and it was all around me.","A rap dude has his rap persona, his hyper version of himself. Do you know Method Man's real name? Or Elton John, Marylin Monroe? You make up this character. That's kind of what we have done with Die Antwoord, playing with characters.","Afrikaans culture is very right-wing and conservative, very proper, and you get this hidden underbelly, the zef side of Afrikaans which no one knows about.","Zef is like dirt, it's like scum. There was no zef movement before we came along.","Don't come to wild shows if you're just going to talk to your friend about whose shoes you're wearing.","I think because people can't understand our style, they think it's a joke. Our music isn't intellectual - we make music for the common man.","When I was a boy, I wanted to be a Ninja. Now I am a man, now I am a Ninja.","'Die Antwoord' just has a nice ring to it.","In South Africa, we speak English and sometimes Afrikaans, sometimes Zulu, sometimes Xhosa.","I used to be called Waddy Jones. But I changed my name to Ninja because it's more me.","There's layers to our stuff: Our top layer is like candy-coated pop, because we want to party and have a nice time, but we also have a lot of different human experiences and other levels present in the Die Antwoord experience.","It's cool having a little bit of money to do your thing.","You can't be new for too long. You want to just respectfully disappear. It's a bit sad sometimes. Michael Jordan retired like a god, and then he came back... We don't want to go out like that.","Roger Ballen is pretty much a member of Die Antwoord, it would be safe to say.","I like Drake's stuff.","The '$O$' phase, it was like, 'Save Our Souls': we didn't know how we were going to get out of our situation... It was our last chance just to go all out. 'Ten$ion' was another phase, to maintain the tension we had, just to pretend nothing had happened and stay in that same furious, hungry zone.","You'll get a kid in Liberia wearing a Tupac T-shirt, and for us, that's zef. People try to say it's like trash, but it's not really trash. It's putting things together you think are cool.","When I saw rappers in the '90s cameo in films - all of those '90s rappers - it seemed like whenever you chucked a rapper in a film, they could just act. It seemed like all rappers could act.","I do this thing with my daughter - I put my hand on her face and shake her head, but really affectionately. But I didn't think, and I did that to Flea.","God made a mistake with me. I'm actually black, trapped in a white body.","We didn't move to L.A. to move to L.A. We moved to make music with Muggs.","We will always make music, but Die Antwoord is... finite.","Die Antwoord is super pop. It's a pop music.","We don't care if you understand us.","America's got amazing presentation, especially New York - the most potent, strongest, concentrated, amazing presentation.","It's good to be intuitive.","The interweb's got a weird vibe.","Die Antwoord will be presented to the world as a wild and savage rap crew from the deep, dark depths of Africa.","The only thing I regret in life is that I didn't practice basketball more.","Conceptual art, I don't even know what that is.","Hollywood's not knocking on our door. They're banging down the door with a sledgehammer.","All the rappers in rave music are like the sloppy seconds of rappers who couldn't make it.","We'll support anyone who's doing something fresh.","We don't work with anyone."],"Watt Key":["I didn't have any writer friends in college. I was a computer science major, but I was writing a lot, probably more than anybody I knew. I started to submit novels to New York when I was a freshman in college.","Some characters think more like me than others; some think more like my dad or someone else. It certainly is made up of my experiences, things I've heard, things I think are funny, things I think are sad. There's sort of a strange, blurry version of yourself in there.","Typically, when you sell your story rights to a movie production company, they can do whatever they want with it. The writer is typically not involved anymore.","I go on a good many adventure-type trips. Whenever I go on one, it's always potentially going to be the setting for one of my books. I pay more attention to certain aspects than some other people might. Sometimes I use them, sometimes I don't. Most of the books I write are based on experiences I've had to some extent.","I'm no Thoreau.","Still to this day, I don't know when I write something whether it's good or not.","The hardest thing about being an unpublished writer is that there's always that voice in your head that asks if you're really being a fool. You might just really stink and not know it. You have to have a lot of blind faith in the process. You have to like it so much that you're going to do it anyway."],"Waverley Lewis Root":["Every country possesses, it seems, the sort of cuisine it deserves, which is to say the sort of cuisine it is appreciative enough to want.","It is the destiny of mint to be crushed.","The turkey has a destiny which ends on San Martino's day."],"Wavy Gravy":["I always say, dare to struggle, dare to grin.","We are all the same person trying to shake hands with our self.","Keep your sense of humor, my friend; if you don't have a sense of humor it just isn't funny anymore.","I was at the 1976 Republican Convention in Kansas City. I was running 'Nobody for President' at the time. I printed up these press releases and handed them out to the crowd at the Kemper Arena. 'Nobody keeps campaign promises.' 'Nobody lowers your taxes.' 'Nobody should have that much power.' 'Nobody is in Washington working for you.'","Laughter is the valve on the pressure cooker of life. Either you laugh and suffer, or you got your beans or brains on the ceiling.","I became a clown when these docs came to the house in Berkeley and asked me to come cheer up kids. I'd just had my third spinal fusion and I was looking for something to take my mind off the pain I was in.","It had an enormous impact to the point of the United Nations passing a resolution against the killing and hunting of these whales as they are an endangered species. This was a documentary on the plight of the whales.","I've been married to the same woman for forty years, and whenever people ask us how we managed to stay married for so long, we usually say as one voice, 'What's the secret? Don't get divorced!'","And I also thought that Richard Nixon was the greatest political education we have ever had, but it looks like we need to relearn them again.","I am in total ecstasy with where my life is now.","If you don't change, you're dead, so I try to keep changing.","Don't underlook the Sixties; we started eating more vegetables, respecting women, and we shut down Vietnam. We did a lot of good stuff. But it shouldn't shut you down from the moment.","I'm related to the portrait painter George Romney.","I had 500 kids at camp this past summer for example. We do nine weeks for kids and nine days for grown ups every summer. The adult camp is a lot of fun.","Sure, I could of done it different... put my clown in a closet and dressed up in straight clothing. I could of compromised my essence, and swallowed my soul.","The 90's are the 60's standing on their head.","To let the people know there was life beyond Shirley Dean, we decided to focus on voter registration; each day I set up my card table somewhere in the district, signed people up, and passed out noses.","Well, this week for example, I was just in Los Angeles making a documentary for German television on whales. They had tried to get me in England where they missed me.","What a rush it was to plunge into the bin of official decision and cast a ballot in favor of FUN.","A clown I knew who was retiring from Ringling Brothers gave me his giant shoes, and somebody else made me a clown suit.","Bob Weir calls me a saint, but I'm 'Saint Misbehavin'.' They're making a documentary about my life, and that's the current shooting title. I can roll with that, but otherwise the s-word makes me really paranoid.","At Marshall Field in Chicago, I had them take a big bed into the menswear department, one with black sheets. I'd get in bed wearing a nightcap, and my fans would get in bed with me, one at a time, and I'd sign their memorabilia. And then I'd give them a free pint of Ben & Jerry's."],"Waylon Jennings":["Honesty is something you can't wear out.","Jessi is a great person. She really is. She's been a friend to me all through all my bad times, and she's understood what I was doing. She came up with that one saying, which was great.","I may be crazy, but it keeps me from going insane.","Because Ritchie Valens WAS the real deal. He was only starting, but in the time he spent in the business, he made big impact. I don't know if anybody could have made a bigger one.","I never have any problem getting enthusiastic with a good song and a good band.","A lot of times they don't want to hear it. But you know, if some good is done to you, you should pass it on.","So I'm not very popular here with those inside the system, as you might guess. I never wanted to be.","Don't ever try and be like anybody else and don't be afraid to take risks.","I didn't aim at anything except good music.","We did an album one time called White Mansions, about the civil war, but it was written by a guy from England. His looking at it from over there and it not being a part of his history made it so he could be objective.","But Buddy was an upper. He was happy. He loved music, and he was really happy. I don't know... I don't believe in reincarnation at all, but if all that stuff is true, then he might have been on his last time around.","But you know, the system almost destroyed itself while it was goin' on trying to destroy us.","I love Johnny Cash, and I respect Johnny Cash. He's the biggest. He's like an Elvis in this business, but no, he's never been the rebel.","I was king of the mountain for a long time, well, I don't want that no more. I like to perform every once in a while for people who want to see me, and cut albums of music that is what I'm really about.","One thing is that I wasn't getting booked that well, and they had control over who got the awards, they had control over who sold. And they really did not want Willie or me, either one, to have a hit record. They wanted the money, but they didn't want us to be the ones.","I mean, I think we're put here on earth to make your own destiny, to begin with. I don't think there's anything you can do this way or that way to change anything.","Mainly what I learned from Buddy... was an attitude. He loved music, and he taught me that it shouldn't have any barriers to it.","And the whole thing is that you're treated like a step-child. Here it was down here, everything in the black, because they were stealing, basically. Stealing from us old country boys down here.","Besides that, I felt guilty. I thought for some reason... I was alive, and Buddy and those boys were dead, and I didn't know how, but somehow I'd caused it.","But ya know what, I am a part of something that happened. I'm a part of the music that happened. My voice is one more instrument, is what it is. So that's the way I feel about people who play on sessions.","Chet loved artists. He did. But he was caught up in the system. He had two hats. He had to have 'em because he did two things: he was an artist, and he was an executive.","Cuz I was never pretty anyway and never cared anything about that.","Finally, my manager negotiated a deal where I got to produce my own records.","It was all devastating. I'd never dealt with losing anyone close to me, and I didn't know where to put it in my life. I was very young then. Buddy taught me so much in such a short time.","Now, I don't know how they judge all that, but if anybody in the world deserves to be in the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame, Ritchie Valens does.","Now, I was on drugs, and that didn't help a whole lot. He hated that. That was part of where Chet and I had problems, so I take complete blame for that.","You know, I feel sorry for the young artists.","You know, in the days when I started, if you had Chet Atkins' name on your record as a producer and it was on RCA, you could work the road. It didn't have to be a big hit record, it just had to have that on it."],"Wayne Allard":["Our men and women in our armed forces are the real heroes in this conflict.","From the employees' standpoint, in 1935, Social Security was a big gamble. Employees would be required to participate in the program, contributing a percentage of their income for their entire adult working life.","I think back a little bit when President Bush was elected President and what kind of economy he inherited from the Clinton administration. The economy was going down. It was not doing well.","In some ways, with the security challenges this country has faced, we have had to put in rules and regulations for business to be able to sustain their growth and create jobs.","I think America is on the right track.","The successful establishment of a buffer zone around Fort Carson will provide an example for other bases around the country as we seek to protect the training mission of the U.S. military while preserving critical habitats on our ranges."],"Wayne Brady":["My mom didn't let me play video games growing up, so now I do. Gaming gives me a chance to just let go, blow somebody up and fight somebody from another dimension. It's all escapism.","I always thought that common sense would prevail. But on a game show, there is no common sense.","Theatre sports is the best improv training period.","Cancelled isn't a bad word because it happens everyday.","I was teased horribly as a child and beaten up a lot.","I didn't know that I could do a talk show. I didn't know that we could bring variety to daytime. I didn't know that people wanted to see singing, and dancing and comedy in the morning.","I'm an actor first and foremost, who happens to do improv. I've also done sitcoms, I've done stage.","I like to be left alone when I'm not working.","Work is the thing that happens around the game time.","I want the single player experience."],"Wayne Coyne":["Music is amazing. There's some metaphysical comfort where it allows you to be isolated and alone while telling you that you are not alone... truly, the only cure for sadness is to share it with someone else.","It was endlessly entertaining, watching people beat each other up. All the little kids in the neighborhood would come and watch... and then we'd beat them up as well.","We hear so many records these days that are done with click tracks, as opposed to a drummer.","Sometimes the song title comes with the songs, other times you just sorta make something up afterwards.","We love it when we make mistakes that are better than something you could think up.","I want people to be ecstatic but to cry at the same time.","I embrace the idea that I'm an entertainer.","I stopped caring so much about what people might think if I sung about love and humanity.","With out art, without communicating, we wouldn't live beyond 30 because we'd be so sad and depressed.","We love playing music but we're too weird to play music.","Anyway, Cat Stevens is never going to make much money out of us.","I can see that if this was an album done 10 or 15 years ago we could see we were moving on to some place else.","Most artists I run into aren't that thrilled with what they do anyway. They are glad to have different versions out there to see which one the audience likes the best.","I am not that thrilled about the way our records sound anyway. Don't get me wrong, I work hard on them and I want them to sound fantastic but I'm happy to have another interpretation of them anyway.","When we started there was this element of these experiments we were doing where we weren't really sure how the music would play out because the music was all on different players.","We made music that wouldn't be in synch.","Most music that you hear is in synch with itself. We were experimenting with the music falling out of synch with itself and even though it is out of synch you mind can still understand what it is meant to be doing.","We never thought it would be something everyone would listen to. We never thought people who listen to Britney Spears would run to listen to it. It was intended for people on the fanatical side of production and hi-fi.","People have given me the freedom and believe in me enough to say if I want to do these things that I will find a way to make it work. I don't know if they think I'm crazy, drug damaged or just an old weirdo.","It really is no different in the way that we make records and shoot music videos. I don't think of the movie as being a great leap out of my current profession.","I knew she was from Australia and I knew that is where she started but I didn't know if she was still popular there. I hope people understand we aren't making fun of Kylie.","When we went to cover it I thought we would change it to a song of loving and longing instead of the sex machine song Kylie turned it into. I've met Kylie and told her we were covering her song and she was pleased.","Even in the beginning, when we knew there was a legal argument about how much our song sounds like his song, as one songwriter to another, I wasn't sure that Cat Stevens would take that as bad.","There is a lot of melody and things that sound familiar in hundreds of songs.","If you have a song that you think sounds like another song you should contact the publishing company and say I have a song here, let's cut a deal that lets everyone walk away feeling good.","Our publicist at Warner Brothers is a young guy who has worked so hard for seven years with us and when we saw him backstage he broke down and cried. He couldn't believe it happened. It was seeing him so overcome when we realised how much it really meant."],"Wayne Dyer":["How people treat you is their karma; how you react is yours.","If you change the way you look at things, the things you look at change.","Be miserable. Or motivate yourself. Whatever has to be done, it's always your choice.","When you dance, your purpose is not to get to a certain place on the floor. It's to enjoy each step along the way.","Go for it now. The future is promised to no one.","The essential lesson I've learned in life is to just be yourself. Treasure the magnificent being that you are and recognize first and foremost you're not here as a human being only. You're a spiritual being having a human experience.","The ego is only an illusion, but a very influential one. Letting the ego-illusion become your identity can prevent you from knowing your true self. Ego, the false idea of believing that you are what you have or what you do, is a backwards way of assessing and living life.","Everything that's created comes out of silence. Your thoughts emerge from the nothingness of silence. Your words come out of this void. Your very essence emerged from emptiness. All creativity requires some stillness.","Self-worth comes from one thing - thinking that you are worthy.","To be more childlike, you don't have to give up being an adult. The fully integrated person is capable of being both an adult and a child simultaneously. Recapture the childlike feelings of wide-eyed excitement, spontaneous appreciation, cutting loose, and being full of awe and wonder at this magnificent universe.","Conflict cannot survive without your participation.","When you judge another, you do not define them, you define yourself.","Real magic in relationships means an absence of judgment of others.","Give yourself a gift of five minutes of contemplation in awe of everything you see around you. Go outside and turn your attention to the many miracles around you. This five-minute-a-day regimen of appreciation and gratitude will help you to focus your life in awe.","The highest form of ignorance is when you reject something you don't know anything about.","You can either be a host to God, or a hostage to your ego. It's your call.","You cannot always control what goes on outside. But you can always control what goes on inside.","The truth is that there is no actual stress or anxiety in the world; it's your thoughts that create these false beliefs. You can't package stress, touch it, or see it. There are only people engaged in stressful thinking.","Begin noticing and being careful about keeping your imagination free of thoughts that you do not wish to materialize. Instead, initiate a practice of filling your creative thoughts to overflow with ideas and wishes that you fully intend to manifest. Honor your imaginings regardless of others seeing them as crazy or impossible.","Live one day at a time emphasizing ethics rather than rules.","Our intention creates our reality.","Transformation literally means going beyond your form.","There is no greater power in Heaven or on Earth than pure, unconditional love. The nature of the God force, the unseen intelligence in all things, which causes the material world and is the center of both the spiritual and physical plane, is best described as pure, unconditional love.","Miracles come in moments. Be ready and willing.","You aren't your work, your accomplishments, your possessions, your home, your family... your anything. You're a creation of your Source, dressed in a physical human body intended to experience and enjoy life on Earth.","Doing what you love is the cornerstone of having abundance in your life.","Your life is like a play with several acts. Some of the characters who enter have short roles to play, others, much larger. Some are villains and others are good guys. But all of them are necessary; otherwise, they wouldn't be in the play. Embrace them all, and move on to the next act.","It's never crowded along the extra mile.","Judgements prevent us from seeing the good that lies beyond appearances.","Become slower in your journey through life. Practice yoga and meditation if you suffer from 'hurry sickness.' Become more introspective by visiting quiet places such as churches, museums, mountains and lakes. Give yourself permission to read at least one novel a month for pleasure.","I grew up in an era of pretty severe poverty. My parents weathered the Great Depression, and money was always a very big concern. I was weaned on a shortage mentality and placed in foster homes largely because there simply wasn't enough money to take care of the most basic of needs.","You are doomed to make choices. This is life's greatest paradox.","The child inside of you knows how to take things as they come, how to deal most effectively and happily with everything and everyone it encounters on this planet. If you can recapture that childlike essence of your being, you can stay 'forever young at heart.'","Fear is present when we forget that we are a part of God's divine design. Learning to experience authentic love means abandoning ego's insistence that you have much to fear and that you are in an unfriendly world. You can make the decision to be free from fear and doubt and return to the brilliant light of love that is always with you.","We are Divine enough to ask and we are important enough to receive.","When you are spiritually connected, you are not looking for occasions to be offended, and you are not judging and labeling others. You are in a state of grace in which you know you are connected to God and thus free from the effects of anyone or anything external to yourself.","Within all of us is a divine capacity to manifest and attract all that we need and desire.","Remind yourself that the greatest technique for bringing peace into your life is to always choose being kind when you have a choice between being right or being kind.","I don't believe in 'thinking' old. Although I've transitioned through many bodies - a baby, toddler, child, teen, young adult, mid-life and older adult - my spirit is unchanged. I support my body with exercise, my mind with reading and writing, and my spirit with the knowing that I am part of the Divine source of all life.","One of the greatest lessons of my own life was learning to turn the inner rampage of hatred and anger toward my own father for his reprehensible behavior and abandonment of his family into an inner reaction more closely aligned with God and God-realized love.","The willingness and ability to live fully in the now eludes many people. While eating your appetizer, don't be concerned with dessert.","People who truly understand what is meant by self-reliance know they must live their lives by ethics rather than rules.","A great hallmark of mental wellness is the ability to be in the present moment, fully and with no thoughts of being elsewhere.","Strong emotions such as passion and bliss are indications that you're connected to Spirit, or 'inspired,' if you will. When you're inspired, you activate dormant forces, and the abundance you seek in any form comes streaming into your life.","You cannot be lonely if you like the person you're alone with.","If you have passion, there is no need for excuses because your enthusiasm will trump any negative reasoning you might come up with. Enthusiasm makes excuses a nonissue.","You do indeed have a past, but not now! And, yes, you have a future, but not now! You can consume your now with thoughts of 'then' and 'maybe,' but that will keep you from the inner peace you could experience.","When you're just like everybody else, you've nothing to offer other than your conformity.","Needing to have things perfect is the surest way to immobilize yourself with frustration.","Stop acting as if life is a rehearsal. Live this day as if it were your last. The past is over and gone. The future is not guaranteed.","There is no scarcity of opportunity to make a living at what you love; there's only scarcity of resolve to make it happen.","Practice radical humility. Take no credit for your talents, intellectual abilities, aptitudes, or proficiencies. Be in a state of awe and bewilderment.","When you seek the presence of your creative Spirit and are filled with passion about virtually everything you undertake, you'll successfully remove the roadblocks from your life and enjoy the active presence of Spirit.","Meditation is a vital practice to access conscious contact with your highest self.","Having a mind that is open to everything and attached to nothing seems to me to be one of the most basic principles that you can adopt to contribute to individual and world peace.","Everything in the universe has a purpose. Indeed, the invisible intelligence that flows through everything in a purposeful fashion is also flowing through you.","Be a force of love as often as you can and turn away negative thoughts whenever you feel them surface.","A mind at peace, a mind centered and not focused on harming others, is stronger than any physical force in the universe.","Thoughts are mental energy; they're the currency that you have to attract what you desire. Learn to stop spending that currency on thoughts you don't want.","The truth is that you can only come to know God when you give up the past and the future in your mind and merge totally into the now, because God is always here now.","When you face a 'performance' that might provoke the 'I'm scared' response, choose love and approach your opportunity as a chance to dance with God. It's more fun than 'Dancing with the Stars!'","Only the insecure strive for security.","What we think determines what happens to us, so if we want to change our lives, we need to stretch our minds.","Our present moment is a mystery that we are part of. Here and now is where all the wonder of life lies hidden. And make no mistake about it, to strive to live completely in the present is to strive for what already is the case.","Your children will see what you're all about by what you live rather than what you say.","When I was young, my brother David and I were farmed off to foster homes, and I spent time in orphanages. My father abandoned us. Here's the most important person in my life, and I never met him.","It makes no sense to worry about things you have no control over because there's nothing you can do about them, and why worry about things you do control? The activity of worrying keeps you immobilized.","We've been programmed, from the time that we were very, very little, about what we can't do - about what is impossible.","I grew up in the east side of Detroit in an area where there was very little, except for a lot of scarcity, poverty and hunger. I never woke up saying, 'I'm an orphan again today, isn't this terrible? Poor me.'","An artist or a creative person of any kind goes about their work because it's their path, it's what excites them, it's what aligns their soul with who they truly are, who they showed up to be.","Abundance is not something we acquire. It is something we tune into.","In my own life I know that my state of cheerfulness is a reliable gauge of my level of spiritual enlightenment at that moment. The more cheerful, happy, contented, and satisfied I am feeling, the more aware I am of my deep connection to Spirit.","Give yourself more opportunities for privacy, when you are not bombarded with duties and obligations. Privacy is not a rejection of those you love; it is your deserved respite for recharging your batteries.","You leave old habits behind by starting out with the thought, 'I release the need for this in my life'.","Water is the softest of all things, yet it is the most powerful. The ocean patiently allows all things to flow into it. It is always flexible. The Tao is not about grasping, but allowing, like water.","Begin to see yourself as a soul with a body rather than a body with a soul.","Our lives are a sum total of the choices we have made.","The Tao teaches us not to intervene and interfere. The things we love we have to learn to leave alone. And the people we love we have to learn to let them be.","There's nothing wrong with anger provided you use it constructively.","In times of need, God can come to you in a myriad of disguises.","My favorite affirmation when I feel stuck or out of sorts is: Whatever I need is already here, and it is all for my highest good. Jot this down and post it conspicuously throughout your home, on the dashboard of your car, at your office, on your microwave oven, and even in front of your toilets!","What comes out when life squeezes you?  When someone hurts or offends you? If anger, pain and fear come out of you, it's because that's what's inside.","We only need so much to survive, but this world we live in tells us we need more stuff to be happy. We're inundated with our televisions, the Internet and advertising that says in order to be happy you have to have these things. When you say, 'Gimme, gimme, gimme,' you will always be in short supply.","Most of us are raised to believe we are ordinary. The anchor of the universe is present in every child. A parent only needs to guide and step aside and let them fulfill their dharma. Help children remember that they can do or be anything.","Dream and you shall become.","You'll see it when you believe it.","Trust and value your own divinity as well as your connection to nature. Seeing God's work everywhere will be your reward.","Freedom means you are unobstructed in living your life as you choose. Anything less is a form of slavery.","Love is the ability and willingness to allow those that you care for to be what they choose for themselves without any insistence that they satisfy you.","Your Highest Self only wants you to be at peace. It does not judge, compare, or demand that you defeat anyone or be better than anyone.","Your timeless self does not age and has no fear of the future. Contemplate your physical self and all its possessions, and practice laughing peacefully at it all.","Everything you need you already have. You are complete right now, you are a whole, total person, not an apprentice person on the way to someplace else. Your completeness must be understood by you and experienced in your thoughts as your own personal reality.","When your higher self is present, it always promotes peace.","When I was an orphan, I was the richest kid at the orphanage because everyone else was complaining about not having anything. But when I discovered that you could get two cents for a Coca-Cola bottle, I would follow people around who were drinking it and ask them if they were almost through with it.","Find joy and solace in the simple, and cultivate your utopia by feeling the Tao in every cubic inch of space.","I implore you to see the universe as a warm and supportive one because you'll look for evidence to support this view. When you anticipate that the universe is friendly, you see friendly people. You look for circumstances to work in your favor. You anticipate good fortune flowing into your life.","As I followed my dream - stayed in-Spirit, that is, inspired - I made more money in the first year after I gave up my employment than I had made in the previous 35 years of my life.","It is impossible for you to be angry and laugh at the same time. Anger and laughter are mutually exclusive and you have the power to choose either.","The child in you, like all children, loves to laugh, to be around people who can laugh at themselves and life. Children instinctively know that the more laughter we have in our lives, the better.","Deficiency motivation doesn't work. It will lead to a life-long pursuit of try to fix me. Learn to appreciate what you have and where and who you are.","Relationships based on obligation lack dignity.","If you are living out of a sense of obligation you are slave.","My enthusiasm seems to cause my world to endlessly offer me cooperative, co-creating experiences. I'm willing and I'm eager, and not just about my writing - I feel the same way about staying in shape, enjoying my family, giving a lecture, or whatever it may be.","Van Gogh never made a penny in his entire lifetime. He painted because it was his soul, his excitement. It was what aligned him with his Source of being. It's the same with me and writing.","I know that I came into the world with what I call 'big dharma' - with a blueprint to teach self-reliance and a positive loving approach to large numbers of people all over the globe. I am ever so grateful for the circumstances of my life that allowed me to be pretty much left alone and to develop as I was so intended in this incarnation.","My own eight children all march to the beat of their inner music, and in some cases, it is definitely far away from what I hear. I've had to honor their instincts and their choices, and merely guided them out of harm's way until they could be their own guides.","My purpose is to help people look at themselves and begin to shift their concepts. Remember, we are not our country, our race, or religion. We are eternal spirits. Seeing ourselves as spiritual beings without label is a way to transform the world and reach a sacred place for all of humanity.","My earliest books focus almost entirely on psychological tools to help readers employ effective commonsense approaches to problems. There are no references to God or a higher self in the first 15 or so years of my publishing history.","There is nothing your highest self wants more than peace. This peace makes you feel worthy of all of the richest blessings of the universe, and when you radiate this out into the world, it is returned to you without fail.","Keep in mind that no matter how perfectly you get your life in order, you will never be rid of all your problems. Problems are a way of life, always have been, always will be. But how you elect to view those problems is all up to you.","Maxim for life: You get treated in life the way you teach people to treat you.","The last suit that you wear, you don't need any pockets.","When I chased after money, I never had enough. When I got my life on purpose and focused on giving of myself and everything that arrived into my life, then I was prosperous.","There's no substitute for the practice of meditation.","It's always interesting about God because it's like all of the religions in the world say that they pray to the same God, and yet they ask that same one God to divide itself up and agree with this one and fight against that one.","Don't program yourself to break down as you age with thoughts that decline is inevitable. Time may be passing for our bodies, but because they house our ageless souls, we never need to see ourselves as old and infirm.","Meditation is difficult for many people because their thoughts are always on some distant object or place. One form of meditation is to label the thought as it appears and then choose to let it go.","Genius is a potential that lives within you and every other human being. You have many moments of genius in your lifetime. These are the times when you have a uniquely brilliant idea and implement it even if only you are aware of how fantastic it is.","Know that any and all thoughts that you have regarding your own skills, interests, and inclinations are valid. To reinforce the validity of your thoughts, keep them private. Tell yourself that they're between you and God.","Take the complications, rules, shoulds, musts, have tos, and so on out of your life. By uncomplicating your life and removing the trivial pursuits that occupy so much of it, you open a channel for the genius within you to emerge.","The fact is that since you're a divine creation who originated in the world of Spirit, you have exactly the right amount of smarts to accomplish all that you need and want to do while you're here on earth. It's all perfect... and so are you!","I have observed that society in general always seems to honor its living conformists and its dead troublemakers.","Loving people live in a loving world. Hostile people live in a hostile world. Same world.","The fact that you are willing to say, 'I do not understand, and it is fine,' is the greatest understanding you could exhibit.","Successful people make money. It's not that people who make money become successful, but that successful people attract money. They bring success to what they do.","I don't write with a machine. I write with a pen and a paper, which is what is most comfortable for me.","One of the huge imbalances in life is the disparity between your daily existence, with its routines and habits, and the dream you have within yourself of some extraordinarily satisfying way of living.","Writing is like anything else - the more you do it, the better you get at it, the easier it comes, and the less concerned you'll be about what's going to happen to it, where it's going, what it sounds like, whether it's right.","I cannot always control what goes on outside. But I can always control what goes on inside.","Simply put, you believe that things or people make you unhappy, but this is not accurate. You make yourself unhappy.","Everything is perfect in the universe - even your desire to improve it.","You can never get enough of what you don't want.","You can't choose up sides on a round world.","Anything you really want, you can attain, if you really go after it.","You are important enough to ask and you are blessed enough to receive back.","The components of anxiety, stress, fear, and anger do not exist independently of you in the world. They simply do not exist in the physical world, even though we talk about them as if they do.","Everything you are against weakens you. Everything you are for empowers you.","There is no way to prosperity, prosperity is the way.","I think and that is all that I am.","People who want the most approval get the least and people who need approval the least get the most.","Your body has space within you that cannot die.","Remember that your imagination is yours and yours alone. You have the inborn capacity to use it in any way that you choose. No one else is responsible for your imagination. Anything placed in your imagination and held there ultimately becomes your reality.","Highly functioning self-actualized people simply never imagine what it is that they don't wish to have as their reality.","I never sell a book. I sell myself. And the way to sell yourself is to be an instrument of love.","Self-actualized people are independent of the good opinion of others.","A person standing in front of an audience without enthusiasm for his subject and his actions is disconnected from his spirit.","The presence of passion within you is the greatest gift you can receive. Treat it as a miracle.","Wanting to feel good is synonymous with wanting to feel God.","I am particularly drawn to the form of meditation called Japa. I know it works.","I think that cancer is a life form that exists out there, and it exists in us. I think even the concept of healing is a spiritual principle that we have to really look at. I think the word itself is something we ought to get rid of, because it implies that there is illness - that there is something wrong.","What is the Tao Te Ching? Five hundred years before the birth of Jesus, a God-realized being named Lao-tzu in ancient China dictated 81 verses which are regarded by many as the ultimate commentary on the nature of existence.","I was inspired to spend an entire year - my 65th year - reading, researching, and meditating on Lao-tzu's messages, practicing them and ultimately writing down these insights as I felt Lao-tzu wanted us to know them.","Your Highest Self is not just an idea that sounds lofty and spiritual. It is a way of being. It is the very first principle that you must come to understand and embrace as you move toward attracting to you that which you want and need for this parenthesis in eternity that you know as your life.","I've learned over the years that when I go to that place of passion within me, there's no force in the universe that can interfere with my completing a project.","If life is a checker game, someone else is moving the pieces. It isn't us. Don't be surprised by amazing coincidences. There are no accidents. Consider, as I learned to do, the incredible interconnectedness of all of life.","I always joke that my kids' favorite holiday is Father's Day. They love the way I celebrate the occasion by writing each of them a thank-you letter and a generous check. It's my way of letting them know how much I appreciate the great pleasure and privilege of being their dad.","I write because writing is something that I have to do. And it doesn't matter whether people like it or not. When I write, I feel the pressure and anxiety that come with taking an empty piece of paper and trying to fill it with something from your own consciousness.","Faith is the complete reliance on the power and goodness of Spirit and the firm belief that you are always connected to this goodness. Always affirm your faith and not your doubt.","Never, and I mean never, allow anyone else's ideas of who you can or can't become sully your dream or pollute your imagination. This is your territory, and a 'Keep Out' sign is a great thing to erect at all entrances to your imagination.","There is not a separate God for each person. There is one universal intelligence flowing through all of us.","If you want to be a voice for peace in the world, begin by making peace a permanent condition of your own life.","Writing is challenging work because it's so easy to get consumed with how it's going, what's going to happen to it, who's going to like or not like it. You want to get all of that stuff out of your head and just let the work flow.","I always tell audiences when I talk about writing: Writing isn't something I do; writing is something that I am. I am writing - it's just an expression of me.","Heaven is a state of mind, not a location, since Spirit is everywhere and in everything.","One of the most important decisions you'll ever make is choosing the kind of universe you exist in: is it helpful and supportive or hostile and unsupportive? Your answer to this question will make all the difference in terms of how you live your life and what kind of Divine assistance you attract.","A lot of people have a sense-of-entitlement mentality that somebody else ought to do these things for them. People are mad at the government for not getting jobs for them. I don't understand why it's the government's responsibility.","The Tao teaches us to let go of things. Use the 80/20 rule. If you take all your clothes, you'll find out that you only wear 20 percent of them. Take what you have and don't use and circulate it. Give stuff to people who truly need it. After all, we come into this world with nothing; we leave this world with nothing.","In my entire life, any time I've ever lost something, I've gotten something even better going around the next corner. It's like one door closes and another door opens. As long as I can walk through the produce section in every grocery store in this country and eat the grapes that they're going to throw away, I know I can be fine.","Whenever you're going through a tough time, generally, you become more compassionate, you become softer, you become more thoughtful, kinder. These are all spiritual qualities that will help you to align yourself with God and God consciousness rather than with a split fear-based consciousness.","As the father of eight children, I'm quite convinced that each individual arrives here with their own unique personality. We are intended here from an invisible held of infinite potentiality. That which has no form, has no boundaries - it's the I that's in the ever-changing body.","The greatest service that can be offered to children who show personality traits or inclinations that might not be understood by the adults around them is to allow them to express their own unique humanity.","'Your Erroneous Zones' was the book that went over the top simply because I believed in it so much.","I don't write the books. God writes the books and delivers the speeches.","By taking responsibility for how you choose to respond to anything or anyone, you're aligning yourself with the beautiful dance of life.","In a universe that's an intelligent system with a divine creative force supporting it, there simply can be no accidents. As tough as it is to acknowledge, you had to go through what you went through in order to get to where you are today, and the evidence is that you did.","I spent years studying the teachings of Patanjali, and he reminded us several thousand years ago that when we are steadfast - which means that we never slip in our abstention of thoughts of harm directed toward others - then all living creatures cease to feel enmity in our presence.","My father, who was jailed for stealing on more than one occasion, just abandoned his fatherly responsibilities and disappeared. I grew up working from the time I was nine years of age. Money was a big issue everywhere I lived.","Comfort and luxury are usually the chief requirements of life for your ego - its top priorities tend to be accumulations, achievements, and the approval of others.","I have always marched to my own beat, and most frequently, it was inconsistent not only with my own immediate family, but with my culture as well.","By staying focused on what I intend to create, by believing that the universe is all-providing, and by knowing that I'm worthy of the unlimited beneficence of the Source of being, I just keep attracting prosperity to me."],"Wayne Grady":["You can't write anything you want. Once you write that first chapter, then everything else is determined. You can write anything you want, but only one thing works.","I become a first-time novelist and a senior citizen on the same day.","In Windsor in the forties, and even up into the fifties and sixties, if you were black, you had to sit in the balcony of the theatres, and you couldn't buy property in most places.","Literature is memory written down. All literature is memory.","America is essentially an entrepreneurial culture: the sizzle is the steak, because, after all, if you buy the sizzle, the steak comes with it. Canada's, in contrast, is a primary-producing culture: we'll buy the steak and hope to get a little sizzle with it. But we know we can't eat sizzle.","I think of magazines as cultural entities rather than boxes of corn flakes that can be sold and shipped around."],"Wayne Gretzky":["You miss 100% of the shots you don't take.","A good hockey player plays where the puck is. A great hockey player plays where the puck is going to be.","Procrastination is one of the most common and deadliest of diseases and its toll on success and happiness is heavy.","Hockey is a unique sport in the sense that you need each and every guy helping each other and pulling in the same direction to be successful.","Ninety percent of hockey is mental and the other half is physical.","I skate to where the puck is going to be, not where it has been.","I wasn't naturally gifted in terms of size and speed; everything I did in hockey I worked for, and that's the way I'll be as a coach.","The highest compliment that you can pay me is to say that I work hard every day, that I never dog it.","I couldn't beat people with my strength; I don't have a hard shot; I'm not the quickest skater in the league. My eyes and my mind have to do most of the work.","Listen, everything I have in my life is because of the NHL and because of hockey, and I love the game and I loved every minute of being a player, I loved coaching, I loved being involved in the NHL.","When I was 5 and playing against 11-year-olds, who were bigger, stronger, faster, I just had to figure out a way to play with them.","The only way a kid is going to practice is if it's total fun for him... and it was for me.","I just like to keep my money in the bank; I'm not a big risk-taker. I don't know anything about the stock market... I stay away from things I don't know anything about.","The biggest difference between L.A. and Edmonton was that instead of people looking at me I was looking at them.","Growing up, I was always the small guy.","I think that from the time you start playing sports as a child you see that your responsibility to your team is to play the best that you can play as an individual... and yet, not take anything away from being part of a team.","I don't like my hockey sticks touching other sticks, and I don't like them crossing one another, and I kind of have them hidden in the corner. I put baby powder on the ends. I think it's essentially a matter of taking care of what takes care of you.","By no means could I play at the level of these kids who play in the NHL now but as 50-year-olds go, I feel really good and I feel blessed that I'm still healthy.","My kids are no different than anyone else's - they tend to disagree with everything I say!","I get a feeling about where a teammate is going to be. A lot of times, I can turn and pass without even looking.","It's an honour and a thrill and a privilege just to play in the NHL.","Most people marry their mother. I married my father.","And people who know me would tell you that away from hockey I'm really not that competitive.","I knew at a young age, whether I was playing baseball or hockey or lacrosse, that my teammates were counting on me, whether it be to strike the last batter out in a baseball game or score a big goal in a hockey game.","I'm very proud of our NHL players. I think they all handle themselves extremely well and they all work really hard.","Look at guys like Larry Bird and George Brett and John McEnroe; that's what they did in their careers. They all wanted to be the guy under the microscope late in the game or late in the match. So you just take on that know-how that that's part of your responsibility, and you learn that's what makes it exciting. That's what makes it fun!"],"Wayne Huizenga":["Some people dream of success, while other people get up every morning and make it happen.","Surround yourself with great people. People are what make businesses prosper.","If you just keep your head down, work, and put it on the bottom line, sooner or later that takes care of everything else.","If you want to accomplish twice as much, you have to work twice as hard.","A deal is like chasing a girl. You work on it until she says, 'Yes,' for a date.","I don't see myself as a personality. I'm just another little guy.","Waste Management was based in Chicago, but I lived in Ft. Lauderdale and for 10 years had to commute to work - catch the 5 P.M. Sunday flight to Chicago and the midnight return flight on Friday.","If you're a sponsor, and you're doing business globally, to bring your guests to South Florida is pretty nice.","You always hear about delegation, but people make the mistake of delegating and not following up. I give authority, but I stay in touch. Otherwise it doesn't work.","Prayer is the most important thing that I do.","By the time I got involved, Blockbuster had already worked out some of the kinks.","Dolphins games always have been among the most popular NFL telecasts in England.","I sold Blockbuster because I saw what was coming: the satellite dish, technology that would make the business obsolete in a few years. Why would people go to a store for a video and then have to return it when they had a dish?","You don't make any money sitting in traffic.","I enjoy building something good and having a successful product and making money.","Part of this country's problem is that people from New York City - Wall Streeters - don't think about the little guy who can't afford things.","I enjoy building more than managing.","We had a saying at Blockbuster: 'If you don't come in on Saturday, don't bother coming in on Sunday.' We worked hard.","Dolphins football has been a lifetime passion for me.","I don't buy cars I can't drive.","I busted my butt all my life building companies.","To me, my business is my life.","People always want cars. It's a huge industry, and there's always new product coming out.","I don't see myself ever selling Republic or AutoNation.","I liked being CEO of Blockbuster, but my job is to put it on the bottom line for shareholders."],"Wayne Knight":["Whatever road you've been given, enjoy that road.","One good thing about TV Land is you're always surrounded by people who know what they're doing, in terms of your fellow actors.","I had the most fun on '3rd Rock'. It was a great show to work on.","I think most people's careers in theater are based on delusion. It's just that mine started early.","I love Tom Kenny. And Jill Talley. And Jennifer Aniston, too!","I'm not really in touch with those 'Seinfeld' lads except Jason Alexander.","Small towns are the worst for getting recognised.","I have this assemblage of small facts, which looks like intelligence but no real depth of knowledge about anything. That's why I'm an actor.","I want to go skydiving. I'd love to go to the Galapagos. Nature still excites me.","I've been in Los Angeles for a while, and the kind of psychological connection that one makes to people, it just doesn't happen out here.","I was never the mascot of the Georgia football team.","There is no fact-checking on tertiary celebrities. You can say whatever you'd like, and it will just rise up again.","I'm a wuss - a complete wuss!","There's an appreciation of the whole picture of life as opposed to just ambition and circumstance and all the stuff that happens in this business. You find yourself lucky enough to be working with somebody really talented who you know and who you trust.","I know there are some people in British Columbia who are still holding a vigil for '3rd Rock'."],"Wayne Kramer":["You get on the radio by writing your own songs. But we had the dilemma of not being able to play anywhere because we weren't able to play anything that anyone wanted to hear. So we learned songs that we thought that we could do without puking.","If you put this in the context of Detroit in '64 or '65, the economy was booming. Everybody had jobs and there was a whole nightclub culture where bands could work.","Drugs, were a symptom - they weren't the cause of anything.","When I first started playing in a band, before the Beatles, working bands played standards and they saved their rock material til the end of the night when they were really stretched out. It could be pretty lame.","Drugs, sex, booze, all the stuff that we wanted to do. The problem was that we didn't want to learn the top 40 'cause most of the music was awful and we had this other idea about what we wanted to do.","When we first started playing in the early days, none of us really had any idea about writing our own songs yet. We were struggling how to learn our instruments and play songs to be able to perform for people.","Aesthetically, we were enormously successful. Economically... there was no success. It was all about music of the future and unfortunately it was a band that didn't have any future.","I hate that expression, 'fusion.' What it means to me is this movement where nothing ever really fused.","We played together for so long and we got to the point where our styles blended together. Even today, sometimes I'll hear our records and I'm not really sure who played what. And we took a bunch of acid together too.","It wasn't a class system where I was the better guy and he was the second-rate guy. That was his role and my role was to play the solos. But he took great pride in his technique as a rhythm guitarist.","As time went on, we formed a number of different bands. We played in rival, neighborhood bands. We learned more songs and we learned how to play Chuck Berry music and we learned Ventures songs.","I was a little ahead of him but that didn't matter after awhile.","When we first met, I was trying to put a band together. I asked around at school for other guys who wanted to play in a band. Someone told me about a juvenile delinquent they knew who played bongos.","But when I was a teenager, the idea of spending the rest of my life in a factory was real depressing. So the idea that I could become a musician opened up some possibilities I didn't see otherwise."],"Wayne McGregor":["If you put yourself in a place where you're having to work at understanding something, then you keep yourself awake to all possible choices. How the body will look like in the future, the ethics of the body: those are questions that really fascinate me. Let's get the dialogue going.","Choreography and creativity - it's my matrix; let's see where we can move.","I've always been just as interested in making people think as I am in making them feel, and one of the things this scientific process allows me to do is make the audience look differently at dance.","I like to practise. With every new piece, you make mistakes and you learn. So it's important to get on and have another go.","Everyone is always telling me that I must be exhausted, but I've learned how to use my time well, and that includes holidays to recharge. I always try to give myself big chunks of time to think about what the next project is going to be.","My influences change all the time; they have to remain current, because they're the things that capture your imagination and make you want to go into the studio.","With dance and theatre, I think people get very nervous about not knowing the right things. They feel like they've missed something, or that they're not bright enough to watch it. It's not a test.","Unlike a lot of choreographers, I don't always start with the music. I often start with a visual artist, and then find music that fits the world of that visual artist.","I listen to music all the time, and I just choose things I like, or things that I've not used before. Sometimes I work with music that's very difficult - that I don't even particularly like, per se, but that is really complex or interesting.","Once I'm working on something, I don't do anything else. I'm mono-track.","Dancers can get to see almost everything now. When I used to go into companies to make a piece, the dancers had hardly ever seen my work. Now they can watch it on YouTube. It means they're much faster at picking up material.","I enjoy my work too much to force-feed myself with pressure.","'Entity' is not about science. The process behind it may dictate the nature of the piece, but it's not like a dance about Einstein where I'm trying to convert his ideas into movement and communicate that to an audience.","I always try to keep a little bit of space in the year to work with other people. Because I love doing musicals, films and plays - projects where I'm not in charge, where I've got somebody else telling me what to do and I have to work with their vision.","I think it's the responsibility of a major opera house not only to cultivate debate and get people thinking, but also to be interfaced with things that challenge them. To challenge its audience and not just deliver things that they know, even though some of those things are wonderful.","Some people are fascinated by what they know, and some are fascinated by what they don't know. I'm just very interested in what's possible."],"Wayne Newton":["You have to go through those mountains and valleys - because that's what life is: soul growth.","When I die, I'd like to come back as a cello.","I believe that fate is choices - it's not chance.","When you think about those of us that live the life that we want to live, we can thank absolutely and completely our men and women in uniform. Because if it were not for them, we wouldn't enjoy the freedoms that we have.","I played Vegas at the age of 16 years old, in 1959.","Las Vegas and I both grew up together, and all of a sudden I was doing things that no performer had ever done before.","I miss the personalization that Vegas was - there were showroom captains and all the dealers knew the gamblers by their first names.","When I first met Elvis, we had so much in common and became fast friends.","I've always had great faith in people.","I've always had great faith in the Man Upstairs.","I love taking chances.","If it were not for the bad things that've happened to me, I wouldn't be the person I am today.","I don't really believe in regrets.","There's no room in my life for feeling sorry for myself.","Sure, I've been a victim, but in retrospect, most of it has been of my own making. I allowed it to happen.","You can take of a man's money, but when it's all said and done, you've only taken his money.","When you take of a man's time, you've taken a part of his life.","One night I went to see Bobby at the Flamingo. Because he was my hero, I would visit him for inspiration.","But one man never laughed. He was a giant among men. He was Bobby Darin and he was my friend.","When I come offstage, if I've done a bad show or had a bad night, the fact that everybody was standing at the end or three or four times during the show means nothing to me. I know I could have done a better show.","There are people who are surprised at my politics and being a conservative and the rest of it. But the truth of the matter is, to my knowledge, I have never been overlooked or turned down for anything that I wanted to do that was being offered to me.","I have been involved with the USO really my entire life. The first show I did for the USO, I was nine years old.","Johnny Carson was a mean-spirited human being. And there are people that he has hurt that people will never know about. And for some reason, at some point, he decided to turn that kind of negative attention toward me. And I refused to have it.","I'm better off working as opposed to lying around.","On any given night - there are nights that you feel better. There are nights that you are vocally better. There are nights that you are not as vocally good. No question about it.","All of our early hits, 'Danke Schoen' and 'Red Roses,' were produced by Bobby Darin.","Elvis and I were very good friends. We were such good friends that, on the day that he passed, I was the first one his father called, to let me know what had happened.","Once you're a Virginian, you're always a Virginian."],"Wayne Rogers":["You trivialize the idea of competition totally, then there's no point in having the competition in the first place, and everybody is getting a trophy.","The world is getting smaller and smaller every day. We cannot find ourselves dependent on somebody who is untrustworthy.","I may have a slightly paranoid nature, a fear of losing control of my life.","There is a big cry in California to stop everyone from running to Canada.","People in Hollywood are going make pictures where ever it's the least expensive to make them.","Villains never know they are villains in a picture so I play this like I'm the nicest guy in the world.","Everybody thinks about Bo Derek as being this extravagant looking lady but she is also a wonderful actress.","Yes, I loved MASH. As we are sitting here now talking, it's playing somewhere in the world.","You're in the public eye and you just hope that people don't come up and interrupt you while your in the middle of a meal or a conversation or something like that.","The rehearsal is where it all happens for an actor.","Those differences are what color the performance, but in the movies you don't get a chance to rehearse.","I'm one of those actors who likes to do it wrong nine ways before I come to the tenth way, which is the way I think it should be.","I love to be in the position of not knowing what I'm gonna do, but having rehearsed all of those so when something happens with the others actors I go with whatever that is I'm getting.","When your in the movie business you have a start date and a stop date.","I like to create a nice environment and let people reveal themselves instead of trying to trick them or surprise them with a hidden question.","There is no fun in getting into a debate or a contest of wills. If something important comes out of the conversation, okay. If not, that's okay, too.","I'm not hiding anything. What you see is what you get.","I believe it's easier to be an actor. Somehow, interviewing seems to be intrusive on people's lives.","Somebody once told me I shouldn't try to change Hollywood. That isn't my point at all. I don't want Hollywood to change me.","I'd heard stories about business managers who lost their client's money. My feeling was that if I made any money, I wanted to lose it myself, to be the author of my own demise.","I'm not saying I'm a paragon of virtue, but it's hard for me not to be honorable.","Acting is doing. It's not speaking; it's behavior. It's something happening, even if you're only listening.","I have always been interested in theater, as an actor and as someone who looks upon theater - at the risk of sounding pretentious - as an icon by which we measure society... My life has been in the theater to an extent. It's only an extension to write, direct, produce, whatever.","You can't change the market; the market just is.","Look first at management. That's the key to a company.","We own a shopping center in Temecula that is occupied and making money. In Florida, I am doing a 500-home subdivision just north of Eglin Air Force Base.","The best government is the least government. In some areas, I'm libertarian. I don't subscribe to any one party; they are all bad.","Everything that is large and institutional should be distrusted, even though it may be the best around. The Internal Revenue Service doesn't trust me, so why should I trust them? It's a quid pro quo arrangement.","I have no great desire to play a great role. You can't make quality on TV anyway. It's always a manure pile. You're on the top, or you're on the bottom, but it's still a manure pile, and I'm not sure the movie industry isn't like that, too.","What I would really like to do is live in a university town and be an intellectual bum. I just want to write, read, whatever. I'm very eclectic. I read every night until my eyes burn.","I hate television, but that's me. It's like sucking your thumb. It's a wonderful thing for keeping the masses enslaved.","We're headed towards a fascist economy in which you have big government, big corporations and big labor, and they're all in cahoots to strangle the entrepreneur.","We have morons representing us. People who go up and vote for a bill that they have never read - I mean, are we crazy? Are we insane to hand over our government to those kinds of people?","Do we need Medicare reform? Yes we do.","Entrepreneurs bring to business... creativity.","If you are an entrepreneur, you have to think outside of the box.","I have an appetite to always learn.","Our children and grandchildren are not going to have the same standard of living unless we educate that workforce.","You've got the federal government in every part of our lives, doing things wrong.","Free speech is not a bogus issue. It is an issue.","If you could wean yourself off of oil and not be dependent on the Middle East, obviously it's better.","As far as cutting jobs, you could cut whole agencies out of the federal government and not miss them.","People will always want a free lunch.","Everybody thinks they deserve something.","When you start a sentence with the word 'illegal', you've got nowhere to go. An illegal is illegal.","It's not up to the employer to decide or to figure out what religious problems you may have as an employee. In other words, if I'm inquiring about your religious peculiarities or whatever they may be, I'm invading your privacy about that.","To wash dishes is not the same as a guy running a numerically-controlled machine. That guy running a numerically-controlled machine is going to get a higher level of pay because his training is higher, and he should get a higher level of pay.","When it comes to jobs, jobs are just like products in the sense that the free market operates and sees that somebody gets paid what they're worth.","The fact of the matter is that the government is there to protect the people."],"Wayne Rooney":["Becoming a dad means you have to be a role model for your son and be someone he can look up to.","Perfect partners don't exist. Perfect conditions exist for a limited time in which partnerships express themselves best.","I just hate losing and that gives you an extra determination to work harder.","You just want to keep playing consistently now and keep working hard and I'm sure the goals will come.","Part of my preparation is I go and ask the kit man what colour we're wearing - if it's red top, white shorts, white socks or black socks. Then I lie in bed the night before the game and visualise myself scoring goals or doing well.","I play the game as honestly as I can. If the referee gives a penalty there is nothing you can do.","As you get older you play in more important games and that is when you start thinking about what will happen if you win or lose.","I'll keep doing my training and I'm sure the goals will come.","I want to score in every game and win things. That's the most important thing.","The lifestyle I lead as a footballer means I am always in the spotlight.","Everyone who watches me play knows I am an honest player.","When you are 16 there is no fear whatsoever. As you get older you play in more important games and that is when you start thinking about what will happen if you win or lose.","I am mentally strong.","I've trained all my life. I've always been one who enjoys training so it's not something that I think I can just stop doing. It might not be as regular but I want to keep training.","Growing up, watching the Premier League as far back as I can remember, feeling the trophy and having the medal around my neck was an unbelievable feeling.","Unlike others who have been caught swearing on camera, I apologised immediately. And yet I am the only person banned for swearing. That doesn't seem right.","Pulling on your country's shirt is the greatest honour a footballer can have. It's what I always dreamed of as a kid and I get a buzz every time.","If I'm staying in a hotel or I'm sleeping on my own I have the hairdryer on.","Becoming a dad was the proudest moment of my life. Playing football does not even compare.","I might have faults but I'm not a big head.","Nice to see your home fans boo you. That's what loyal support is.","I love football, I've never really taken an interest in anything else.","I think the fans are going to expect a lot from me, as they should.","I've matured since joining United, on and off the field.","If you look at my bookings, they've gone down each season. That's something I'm trying to keep improving. On the pitch you don't want any silly bookings.","There's a lot more pressure on me at United. There are people out there trying to shoot you down.","Sometimes you have to rest in certain games, but I want to play in every game.","Some players don't like training and I've seen some players who aren't bothered if they play or not. But I want to play every game. Sometimes you have to rest in certain games, but I want to play in every game.","If we're on long-haul flights I've been known to sleep on the floor so I hear the engine.","I don't normally cook, but if I did it probably would be beans, sausage, bacon and eggs. I never really get to eat that to be honest.","I'm not really that bothered by appearance. I know a few players who go off doing stuff in the mirror ages before they go out to play a game, but I'm not really interested in that.","I've learnt that it is important not to go over the top with aggression, because then either you are going to miss a lot of games, or you are not going to be concentrating on the game you are playing.","I love football, football is my life.","Diving has been in the game for years. Probably the coverage the game gets now, with all the cameras around, it gets highlighted a bit more. But it hasn't got any worse.","If you don't score, and you have chances, you are disappointed.","I train as hard as I can every time I train and I do extra training every day and I've done that since I was a young boy.","I am not the first player to have sworn on TV and I won't be the last.","I am as passionate about the England team as anyone.","Just to confirm to all my followers I have had a hair transplant. I was going bald at 25 why not.","I'm only a human being.","When they talk to me, people say, 'I didn't expect you to be how you are.'","I'm just a normal young lad who plays football.","It's strange but I suppose I'm one of those senior players now and I'll be helping the young players as much as I can.","You can learn more from the lows than the highs. The highs are great but the lows make you really look at things in a different way and want to improve. Every player will have both in their careers and I have, but what you get is that experience which is so important to perform at your best.","Football's about the young players, bringing youth team players through to the first team and hopefully getting the best out of them so they can go on to play for their country.","When famous people come up to you it's a bit weird, but it's an honour, really, when they recognise you and want to chat to you for a bit.","I love Barbados, it's really relaxing.","I've started doing my coaching badges, I'd like to be a manager one day.","If you're not scoring the frustrations build up.","Early on in my career I had a lot of bad press about my temperament, but I was only a young lad then.","I don't think I look up to any players. Obviously you respect everyone.","When I was younger, I used to visualise myself scoring wonder goals, stuff like that.","I like musicals and I love music.","There are many ways to grow football-wise. You go slow or are pushed to go faster, otherwise you get left behind. For me, there would be trouble in stopping learning.","The important thing is to be there, score when needed. It's better if the goals are beautiful, better still if they are important.","Those who said I'm not an out-and-out goal-scorer are probably right. I always feel I could score more.","I love football so when I finish playing I would like to still be involved in it somehow and a manager would be my first choice.","When I was about 16, I got my ball taken off me by the police for playing in the street - which is pathetic really.","Football is made up of all kinds of conflict. In a dressing room, between players, between us and the manager, between us and loads of people who don't seem to matter. It's constant and harsh sometimes.","I'm proud I'm English and I'm passionate about my country.","You're trying to put yourself in that moment and trying to prepare yourself, to have a 'memory before the game. I don't know if you'd call it visualising or dreaming, but I've always done it, my whole life."],"Wayne Shorter":["You know the actor John Garfield? In one movie he walked up to this train station, the ticket booth, and the guy says, 'Yes, where are you going?' And he says, 'I want a ticket to nowhere.' I thought: that's it. The freedom to do that. I want a ticket to nowhere.","You're like the girl who left her shadow in the drawer, but when she went to get it, it wasn't there."],"Wayne Swan":["In Australia, we've always been a country that runs the ball right up the middle on the fifth tackle. We've never seen a challenge we didn't like, and we've certainly never run from one.","If I could distil the relevance of Bruce Springsteen's music to Australia it would be this: don't let what has happened to the American economy happen here. Don't let Australia become a down-under version of New Jersey, where the people and the communities whose skills are no longer in demand get thrown on the scrap heap of life.","You can't be a first-world economy in the 21st century if you're not on the path to a clean energy future.","Isn't that the great thing about Christmas? You get a lot of respite, time to recharge your batteries, time with family without too much else happening anywhere else in the world, time to focus on the people you love and the activities that you enjoy, time to exercise, to read.","Losing a parent is a hard thing... I often sit here and think it would be great if mum and dad were alive and had a chance to see their grandkids grow up.","You can't be a first-world economy in the 21st century if you haven't laid the groundwork to seize the opportunities.","As is widely accepted, putting a price on carbon pollution is the lowest cost and most efficient way to tackle dangerous climate change.","We know that a smarter Australia means a stronger Australia. An Australia able to grasp the opportunities of the Asian Century. A skilled workforce and a strong, productive and resilient economy. We know we'll only win the economic race in the Asian Century if we win the education race.","The word 'cancer' carries with it enormous fear, fear for the future, fear for family.","I want to ensure and the Government wants to ensure that Australia is well prepared to tackle dangerous climate change with a scheme which is both responsible and which meets our international commitments.","We believe in the Australian promise; that if you work hard, you won't be left behind.","It's often the case that great artists - people like Bruce Springsteen - tend to pick up the subterranean rumblings of profound social change long before the economic statisticians notice them. Changes start long before they become statistics."],"Wayne Thiebaud":["The Gold Rush and the Pony Express made Sacramento a substantial place in terms of enterprise.","My sin as a painter is that I just want to paint anything I want to paint - and repaint."],"Wayne White":["Almost all Iraqis with any previous experience in the intelligence business are Sunni Arab, increasing the risk of penetration of the new intelligence apparatus by the insurgency.","But nobody predicted anything of this magnitude in terms of resistance. And in part, the magnitude of the resistance was spurred by our failures in reconstruction.","I don't like the idea of busing children all over the country. It's not safe. And there doesn't seem to be that much of an urgent need for it to be done.","If they make the deadline because the Shiites and Kurds essentially rammed a draft through over Sunni Arab objections, there will be hell to pay.","The whole purpose of those attacks was to drive those contractors out. Lots of them had to leave. They were terrified."],"Wayne Wonder":["My first encounter with a Kelly was not on a musical scale. It was from primary school. Dave and I went to primary school together and we were like boy scouts.","I am a conservative type of person, so sometimes when I'm chilling with myself, people always come ask me, 'What's wrong with you? What are you wondering about?'","Anything I sing is supposed to be genuine. It's not supposed to be make-believe or I'm making something for the crowd to jump or to hold up their hands.","It's always a live experience - anything that happens around you. It's so easy to just put it to a song.","My grandmother always told me you must keep to your old roads and stick to your original friends and just go through smooth, be careful and stay positive.","People call me Wayne Wonder and it also goes back to football because I could do mad skills with the ball and people would marvel and wonder how I could do it.","That's me, man - I'm a lover not a fighter.","What I say is from my heart. You must be sincere. So when I sing a song, people are supposed to feel it."],"Webb Simpson":["I felt the Lord telling me just to be patient all year. Whether it happened this year, next, or never, everything was going to be okay.","It feels great to win and I can't be more thankful to the Lord for walking me through every step. God was and is so faithful every time.","To be honest, I never really wrapped my mind around winning.","But more than anything I kind of pride myself in continuing the process that we're trying to accomplish, and that's just to get better and work on my fundamentals. So that's been kind of in the theme now for a couple years and we stuck with it and that's kind of what I want to keep doing.","I didn't want to settle or become complacent after winning a major, I wanted to stay hungry. It's easy to do. It's easy to win a big tournament and kind of get a little lazy, so it's been a good motivator for me to work a little harder.","I mean, I think having a great family like I do. You know, I tend to want to give it all I have when I'm at the golf course, and then when I leave I don't want to think about golf at all. And I just remind myself almost daily that golf's just my job, it's not who I am.","I think I'm bad luck for Tiger because he missed the cut in Charlotte with me. But yeah, those are two of the best players of all time. Tiger's the best player of all time in my opinion, so when he's not in the field, it's a relief because he's such a great player.","I had a peace all day. I knew it was a tough golf course. I probably prayed more the last three holes than I ever did in my life.","I'd be stupid not to thank my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ because it was tough out there and I was nervous, and I felt his presence all day.","I'm a guy who loves my family, and we're probably only going to have a couple of more babies. I have the rest of my life to play the British Open.","One of my thoughts on the back nine was 'I don't know how Tiger has won 14 of these things,' I couldn't feel my legs on the back nine.","I wanted to just come out and continue to improve my game, continue to improve my mental capacity to play well in tournaments. I've had a slow year compared to last year, but I've been pleased because I felt like I was getting better."],"Weegee":["People are so wonderful that a photographer has only to wait for that breathless moment to capture what he wants on film.","This is unexposed film of Greenwich Village because nothing ever happens there."],"Weili Dai":["It is pure mythology that women cannot perform as well as men in science, engineering and mathematics. In my experience, the opposite is true: Women are often more adept and patient at untangling complex problems, multitasking, seeing the possibilities in new solutions and winning team support for collaborative action.","In science, technology, engineering and mathematics, men far outnumber women in the classroom and the boardroom.","Technology is one of the key drivers of female economic empowerment, but the fields that women choose to participate in are still decidedly gendered.","Let students use technologies in the classroom.","I believe it is in the world's interest to develop environments that fully engage women and leverage their natural talents.","I believe in order to make a friend, you have to be a friend.","I was very fortunate when I was little - I played basketball. You really absolutely learn how to be a team player, how to win a game, to accomplish things, not just for yourself.","In terms of achievement, the pride is very important to me. It keeps me going every day. The money is always second to me.","I grew up in a Chinese family where the parents' No. 1 priority is the kids' education.","Technology is a nerdy field. That's why I called myself a 'geek.' It requires a lot of training and encouragement at a very young age.","A lot of people believe women can't do tech-y stuff. Becoming nerdy doesn't have to mean the short-haired guy, but can be the woman with very long, beautiful hair.","Women have their own strengths, like fashion. In technology, we can contribute in a big way in terms of the design of the user interface.","I believe women are the glue of everything."],"Wellington Mara":["In trying to scramble out of a hole, it sometimes digs it deeper.","The Church does not pretend to be scientists. It teaches based upon what science tells it.","Self-justification is a treacherous servant.","Just as it had taken centuries to determine the true nature of the universe, so also the search for the beginning of human life proceeded well into the 20th century.","The Church has never changed its teaching on the sanctity of human life - it didn't make up a rule for the convenience of a particular time like a rule at a country club as the Governor would have us believe.","Pop knew absolutely nothing about pro football.","Maybe since I was 35 years old it was time to go upstairs.","These days I'm pretty much a businessman.","I think when the bottom started to drop out, we didn't recognize it.","We didn't readjust our thinking or rebuild quick enough.","You can believe that he was taught to love and respect all mankind - but to fear no man.","I always root for the defense."],"Wen Ho Lee":["I feel that racial profiling may be a very complicated and long-standing problem. It will take a long time even to make tiny progress.","I used the best technique that I knew to protect my files.","I know what you're saying, but I already told you all the truth and I, I don't what, I don't know what else to do. I just do the best I can and tell you the only thing I can, and that's what I already told you many times."],"Wen Jiabao":["I have a dream to provide every Chinese, especially children, sufficient milk each day.","It is only when there is the supervision and critical oversight from the people that the government will be in a position to do an even better job, and employees of government departments will be the true public servants of the people.","As far as the U.S. economy is concerned, I always believe that the U.S. economy is solidly based, not only in a material sense, but more importantly, the United States has the strength of scientific and technological talent, and managerial expertise.","All political parties, organizations, and all people should abide by the constitution and laws without any exception. They must all act in accordance with the constitution and laws. I see that as a defining feature of modern political system development.","As long I still have a breath left in me I will dedicate myself fully to China's reform.","There are two books that I often travel with; one is 'The Theory on Moral Sentiments' by Adam Smith. The other is 'The Meditations.' It's not that I agree with either views expressed in the books, but I believe ideas and thoughts of older generations can offer food for thought for the current generation.","If in a country, most of the wealth is concentrated in the hands of the few, then this country can hardly witness harmony and stability.","The Chinese government attaches importance to, and protects, human rights. We have incorporated these lines into the Chinese constitution, and we also implement the stipulation in real earnest. I think for any government, what is most important is to ensure that its people enjoy each and every right given to them by the constitution.","I don't think a system or a government should fear critical opinions or views. Only by heeding those critical views would it be possible for us to further improve our work and make further progress.","Socialism, as I understand it, is a system of democracy. Without democracy, there is no socialism.","I believe I and all the Chinese people have such a conviction that China will make continuous progress and the people's wishes for and needs for democracy and freedom are irresistible.","Only science and the spirit of seeking truth from facts can save China. I firmly believe in this.","China is a main energy consumer and, therefore, is also a big greenhouse gas emitter. We must use energy resources rationally and must conserve. This needs us to adjust our economic structure, transform the mode of development, to make economic development more dependent on progress of science and technology and the quality of the work force.","More scientific language and less diplomatic rhetoric may make this world even better.","There are people who will appreciate what I've done, and there will be people who will criticize me. Ultimately history will have the final say.","If people are able to run the affairs of a village well, eventually they'll be able to run a township, and a county."],"Wendelin Van Draanen":["Part of my motivation for writing mysteries for young people is that I loved mysteries when I was growing up, and now that I'm on the creative end of things, I'm discovering that they're even more fun to write!","Don't even try to talk to me when I'm watching the moon. That's my moon, baby.","My mission as a writer is to give my readers hope to carry with them, and to promote a belief that they can do anything they set their minds to.","I've run my whole life - for more than exercise, for mental health.","I rewrite my books many times before submitting them, and after my editor takes a look I wind up rewriting some more! It's a good thing I learned at an early age to keep on trying. Stick to it, and eventually you'll get there.","What sort of person you grow into should not be achieved by default, and often that's exactly what happens to kids. I see literature as a method of guidance, information, and contemplation, and consider it the greatest compliment possible when a reader tells me that a book of mine really made him/her think.","Writing is work. It takes a lot of contemplation, concentration, and out-and-out sweat. People tend to romanticize it, that somehow your work appears by benefit of some mystical external force. In reality, to be a writer, you have to sit down and write. It's work, and often it's hard work.","I believe in the paramount importance of entertainment, but I have something to say.","You can't be preachy - kids are allergic to messages.","If you are interested in writing, get out and live your life! Do a lot. See a lot. Keep your eyes and ears open. Pay attention to the different ways people speak. Read lots of different kinds of books. And then try writing in different voices and styles - don't be afraid to experiment.","There are certain things I believe we need to keep in our emotional arsenal as we navigate through life. Hope is a big one. The more of that we can carry, the better.","I write early in the morning at the computer, and people think I'm crazy, but I still use my Mac-Classic even though we have a state-of-the-art PC. There are just less distractions with the simpler machine."],"Wendell Berry":["I come into the peace of wild things who do not tax their lives with forethought of grief... For a time I rest in the grace of the world, and am free.","The care of the Earth is our most ancient and most worthy, and after all our most pleasing responsibility. To cherish what remains of it and to foster its renewal is our only hope.","I am not bound for any public place, but for ground of my own where I have planted vines and orchard trees, and in the heat of the day climbed up into the healing shadow of the woods.","The past is our definition. We may strive with good reason to escape it, or to escape what is bad in it. But we will escape it only by adding something better to it.","The old and honorable idea of 'vocation' is simply that we each are called, by God, or by our gifts, or by our preference, to a kind of good work for which we are particularly fitted.","Better than any argument is to rise at dawn and pick dew-wet red berries in a cup.","Annual plants are nature's emergency medical service, seeded in sounds and scars to hold the land until the perennial cover is re-established.","The atmosphere, the earth, the water and the water cycle - those things are good gifts. The ecosystems, the ecosphere, those are good gifts. We have to regard them as gifts because we couldn't make them. We have to regard them as good gifts because we couldn't live without them.","It is not from ourselves that we learn to be better than we are.","We cannot know the whole truth, which belongs to God alone, but our task nevertheless is to seek to know what is true. And if we offend gravely enough against what we know to be true, as by failing badly enough to deal affectionately and responsibly with our land and our neighbors, truth will retaliate with ugliness, poverty, and disease.","The two great aims of industrialism - replacement of people by technology and concentration of wealth into the hands of a small plutocracy - seem close to fulfillment.","We have the world to live in on the condition that we will take good care of it. And to take good care of it, we have to know it. And to know it and to be willing to take care of it, we have to love it.","Whether we and our politicians know it or not, Nature is party to all our deals and decisions, and she has more votes, a longer memory, and a sterner sense of justice than we do.","To cherish what remains of the Earth and to foster its renewal is our only legitimate hope of survival.","We learn from our gardens to deal with the most urgent question of the time: How much is enough?","If we can't afford to take good care of the land that feeds us, we're in an insurmountable mess.","All right, every day ain't going to be the best day of your life, don't worry about that. If you stick to it you hold the possibility open that you will have better days.","Urban conservationists may feel entitled to be unconcerned about food production because they are not farmers. But they can't be let off so easily, for they are all farming by proxy.","To be interested in food but not in food production is clearly absurd.","This, I thought, is what is meant by 'thy will be done' in the Lord's Prayer, which I had prayed time and again without thinking about it. It means that your will and God's will may not be the same. It means there's a good possibility that you won't get what you pray for. It means that in spite of your prayers you are going to suffer.","We're all complicit in the things we may be trying to oppose. I'm complicit in the things that I'm trying to oppose.","The latest technology is not always good for anything except to the producers of the technology.","The fertility cycle is a cycle entirely of living creatures passing again and again through birth, growth, maturity, death, and decay.","Why should conservationists have a positive interest in... farming? There are lots of reasons, but the plainest is: Conservationists eat.","When you are new at sheep-raising and your ewe has a lamb, your impulse is to stay there and help it nurse and see to it and all. After a while, you know that the best thing you can do is walk out of the barn.","For any sin, we all suffer. That is why our suffering is endless.","If conservationists will attempt to resume responsibility for their need to eat, they will be led back fairly directly to all their previous concerns for the welfare of nature.","I've had a good life, and was born to and among people I've admired and loved.","Whether we or our politicians know it or not, Nature is party to all our deals and decisions, and she has more votes, a longer memory, and a sterner sense of justice than we do.","There are no sacred and unsacred places; there are only sacred and desecrated places. My belief is that the world and our life in it are conditional gifts.","I prayed like a man walking in a forest at night, feeling his way with his hands, at each step fearing to fall into pure bottomlessness forever. Prayer is like lying awake at night, afraid, with your head under the cover, hearing only the beating of your own heart.","Industrial agriculture characteristically proceeds by single solutions to single problems: If you want the most money from your land this year, grow the crops for which the market price is highest.","An economy genuinely local and neighborly offers to localities a measure of security that they cannot derive from a national or a global economy controlled by people who, by principle, have no local commitment.","We cannot comprehend what comprehends us.","The only time I've been arrested was in opposing the Marble Hill nuclear power plant in Indiana. That was in 1979.","If I was freer than I had ever been in my life, I was not yet entirely free, for I still hung on to an idea that had been set deep in me by all my schooling so far: I was a bright boy and I ought to make something out of myself... something else that would be a cut or two above my humble origins.","To hear of a thousand deaths in war is terrible, and we 'know' that it is. But as it registers on our hearts, it is not more terrible than one death fully imagined.","These are people who are capable of devotion, public devotion, to justice. They meant what they said and every day that passes, they mean it more.","The primary motive for good care and good use of the land-community is always going to be affection, which is too often lacking.","It is a horrible fact that we can read in the daily paper, without interrupting our breakfast, numerical reckonings of death and destruction that ought to break our hearts or scare us out of our wits.","I'm a writer more than I am a talker.","The uplands of my home country in north central Kentucky are sloping and easily eroded, dependent for safekeeping upon year-round cover of perennial plants."],"Wendell H.

That's where you reflect on who you are, who you hope to be, what you've gone through, and where you hope to go.","The role of culture is that it's the form through which we as a society reflect on who we are, where we've been, where we hope to be.","'The Wire' really is an American classic, and I think that's something to be very proud of.","One of the real worries I had before the first season of 'Treme' aired was that, man, people in New Orleans really hold movie and television shows up to a high standard in how they depict the city.","Gregory Hines was the most talented man I've ever met or seen. Gregory Hines is one of those people that whenever he talked to you, you felt like you were the center of the universe.","I played trumpet for about two weeks. Sixth grade. And I didn't practice. Maybe a little longer than two weeks, but I didn't practice and I was faking it.","At Julliard we had some voice classes. It was really just so you could carry a tune.

And they just make that assumption. And so when there's a little intonation problem, people are very forgiving of them because they heard how soulful they play.","It was really great to also see the response that people were having to 'Treme' 'cause you're in a vacuum when you're on a TV show. You see the response online, you read about it and all of that, but actually to be live and have that many thousands of fans come out, it's really wonderful.","The power of a sports team in a community it's almost indescribable.","The NFL is such a large, multibillion dollar enterprise with fan loyalty because they have provided not only entertainment for sports fans, but memories, good memories, family memories to these fans, that can only bring about good will.","New Orleans, more than many places I know, actually tangibly lives its culture. It's not just a residual of life; it's a part of life. Music is at every major milestone of our life: birth, marriage, death.

The war has done this to our thinking.","It is from weakness that people reach for dictators and concentrated government power. Only the strong can be free. And only the productive can be strong.","We must honestly face our relationship with Great Britain.","A good catchword can obscure analysis for fifty years.","In no direction that we turn do we find ease or comfort.

This is a prospect that any lover of democracy must view with consternation.","But it required a disastrous, internecine war to bring this question of human freedom to a crisis, and the process of striking the shackles from the slave was accomplished in a single hour.","But we cannot just take this historical fact for granted. We must make it live.","Emancipation came to the colored race in America as a war measure. It was an act of military necessity. Manifestly it would have come without war, in the slower process of humanitarian reform and social enlightenment.","For now more than ever, we must keep in the forefront of our minds the fact that whenever we take away the liberties of those we hate, we are opening the way to loss of liberty for those we love.","Free men are the strongest men.","Freedom is an indivisible word. If we want to enjoy it, and fight for it, we must be prepared to extend it to everyone, whether they are rich or poor, whether they agree with us or not, no matter what their race or the color of their skin.","History shows that our way of life is the stronger way. From it has come more wealth, more industry, more happiness, more human enlightenment than from any other way.","I have noticed, with much distress, the excessive wartime activity of the investigating bureaus of Congress and the administration, with their impertinent and indecent searching out of the private lives and the past political beliefs of individuals.","If the British Fleet were lost or captured, the Atlantic might be dominated by Germany, a power hostile to our way of life, controlling in that event most of the ships and shipbuilding facilities of Europe.","In addition, as citizens, we must fight in their incipient stages all movements by government or party or pressure groups that seek to limit the legitimate liberties of any of our fellow citizens.","It has been a long while since the United States had any imperialistic designs toward the outside world. But we have practised within our own boundaries something that amounts to race imperialism.","It is, therefore, essential that we guard our own thinking and not be among those who cry out against prejudices applicable to themselves, while busy spawning intolerances for others.","No man has the right to use the great powers of the Presidency to lead the people, indirectly, into war.","The constitution does not provide for first and second class citizens.","The defense of our democracy against the forces that threaten it from without has made some of its failures to function at home glaringly apparent.","We cannot, with good conscience, expect the British to set up an orderly schedule for the liberation of India before we have decided for ourselves to make all who live in America free.","If we want to talk about freedom, we must mean freedom for others as well as ourselves, and we must mean freedom for everyone inside our frontiers as well as outside.","When we talk of freedom and opportunity for all nations, the mocking paradoxes in our own society become so clear they can no longer be ignored."],"Wendi Deng Murdoch":["I believe if you are nice to people, children will follow.

I think my older sister was probably more clever, but I worked very hard.","I really make sure that my girls understand the importance of education. I don't want them to be spoilt and only know private school kids. I want them to behave well by example.","I had never been in a supermarket before coming to America. At home, my parents wouldn't let me open the refrigerator, because they worried I'd damage the door by opening it too many times.","As for what other people think of me, I could worry about that every day, but choose not to.","I didn't ever plan to be a producer, and I didn't really know what I was getting myself into.","My children speak very good Chinese, and they translate for our American friends.","I grew up in China, but I live in the U.S. and I want my children to understand what's going on over there.

It's a story about a young woman who was given a precious opportunity to work her way up in the world. It's a story about resiliency, and sacrifice, and perseverance.

I was 19 when I was divorced, and my daughter was a year old, and I waited tables here three to four nights a week for several years while I was trying to support myself and my daughter and the day I got that acceptance at Harvard Law School was an unforgettable day.","Americans have the right under the Second Amendment to own firearms, and that is not going to change.","When you're serving at the local level, you have to build strong personal relationships to get things done.","Texas deserves a leader who understands that making education a priority creates good jobs for Texans and keeps Texas on top.","We believe in honoring our mothers and fathers and keeping our smallest residents - our children - healthy.

I'm still trying to decide, but I do think people are ready for a change from the partisan, very fractured leadership we have in Texas.","While Texas women have the right to safe, legal abortion, in reality there are already very few facilities in Texas to provide this essential care. In 2008, 92 percent of Texas counties had no abortion provider.","I haven't pursued it as a senator because I know it's like spitting in the wind. But I still believe it's the right thing. And if I were governor and a bill came to my desk that provided for background checks at gun shows, I would sign that.","We know that Texas is more than a state. Texas has always been a promise. The promise that where you start has nothing to do with how far you can come.","The truth is that at age 19, I was a teenage mother living alone with my daughter in a trailer and struggling to keep us afloat on my way to a divorce. And I knew then that I was going to have to work my way up and out of that life if I was going to give my daughter a better life and a better future, and that's what I've done.","My dad is truly the person who always made me believe in myself, to appreciate that I was smart.","I was one of those kids that could just show up and take the test and do well on it.

State leaders in power keep forcing people to opposite corners to prepare for a fight instead of coming together to get things done.","I've always been open about my life not because my story is unique, but because it isn't.","Most people would identify with the fact that we tend to be defined by the struggles we came through than by the successes. And certainly for me that's true.","I think you have to be careful. You have to know exactly what is going to resonate with voters. And you can't get ahead of that. You have to be very careful with your approach.","When I first put my hat in the ring, several very tried and true and loyal Democratic activists from our community said, 'What? She's not a Democrat. She's a Republican.' I took that as a compliment, you know, that people didn't necessarily know what my ideology might be because I wasn't driven by that.","If I were governor, and a bill came to my desk that provided for background checks at gun shows, I would sign that.","I've never worried about payback. People are hungry for leadership that's not afraid of political consequence.","Enough to using Texas as a political laboratory for testing far-right ideas.

Real Texans don't want any woman to lose control of her life because she can't get birth control.","Texas Republican political leaders take perverse pride in how deeply they have cut our state's education budget.

In many places, districts are forced to choose between prekindergarten programs and English, algebra and art.","I would be lying if I told you that I hadn't had aspirations to run for a statewide office.","The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality - what a joke. In my district, we caught them lying to us about the results of air quality studies in the Barnett Shale. They are playing with the health and safety of our communities, and we are going to tell them that is not acceptable.","Texas has waited too long for a governor who knows that quid pro quo shouldn't be the status quo. It's time for a governor who believes that you don't have to buy a place in Texas' future.","Texans deserve better than failed leaders who dole out favors to friends and cronies behind closed doors. It's time for a governor who believes that you don't have to buy a place in Texas' future.

There are people, of course, in the world of politics, who look for things to be critical about.

I'd help New Yorkers understand that we get less in value from Washington than what we send there in taxes.","Public officials insult our intelligence and our goodwill when they paint rosy pictures about budgets, jobs, bipartisanship, and transparency, and alter their positions on issues simply to keep collecting their paycheck by never disagreeing or disappointing anyone.","I've spent a great deal of time over the past decade as a caregiver for various family members. It gives me a perspective on the struggles that many New Yorkers face with illness, disability, health care, insurance difficulties, and trying to work with and also take care of family members.","They're lots of good Americans here in New York who have common sense and who believe in free markets and free people and limited government under our Constitution. Those are the principles I've always stood for. I know they're right, and that's what I'm going to stand for.","I am the candidate of tax cuts, repealing Obamacare, repealing Dodd-Frank, letting the markets work, coming up with patient-and-doctor-centered healthcare solutions instead of more big government - and just generally getting government off the backs of small businesses.","Judge Sotomayor is a liberal judicial activist of the first order who thinks her own personal political agenda is more important that the law as written.","I had a dream to become a mounted policewoman.","I have been in private law practice in New York City, where my husband and I are raising our children.","The Democrats have concocted this whole phony 'war on women' narrative simply to mask their dreadful record on the economy and jobs.","I'd rather be a lady of the evening than a feminist."],"Wendy Higgins":["I gather inspiration from all aspects of my life and things I see: love, heartache, mistakes, hopes, regrets, successes and faith. And it helps to have a wild imagination.","I tend to lean toward romance, characters, and relationships when I write, so I have to add to the setting elements and world-building when I revise.","I love the ultimate escapism of paranormal and fantasy - all of the otherworldly creatures, magic, and possibilities that transport both reader and writer away from reality for a while - it's such delicious fun!","I rely heavily on my beta readers' honest critiques."],"Wendy Hiller":["I was unbelievably lucky.","Luckily, West End audiences seem to rather like very old people.","When you're young, you're stupid."],"Wendy Kopp":["Research confirms that great teachers change lives. Students with one highly effective elementary school teacher are more likely to go to college, less likely to become pregnant as teens, and earn tens of thousands more over their lifetimes.","Research shows that whether you are low-income or not, mindset is a bigger predictor of success than academic skills, and how students gain great academic skills and persevere in the face of challenges.","You will find it will almost always be more comfortable to sit on the sidelines and critique the builders from afar. But at the end of the day, the people who make a difference, the people who shape history, are not the haters.","We are looking for a set of personal characteristics that predict success, the first and foremost of which is perseverance in the face of challenges. We also look for the ability to influence and motivate others who share your values, strong problem-solving ability, and leadership.","On average, our corps members stay in the classroom for eight years. But again, given the systemic nature of educational inequity, we know it is vital that some of our alumni take their experience outside the classroom.","We aspire to be equal opportunity, but all across the country where a student is born, their race, their class affect where they end up.","While I started out with a vague understanding that diversity would be important, my own observations have led me to realize that achieving greater levels of diversity is in fact vital to our long-term success.","Teach For America was built on the idea that our best hope of reaching 'One Day' is to have thousands of alumni use their diverse experiences and ideas to effect change from inside and outside the education system.","As a senior at Princeton, I felt like the whole world was open to me. In our country, that's not a given. We aspire to be a place of equal opportunity, and yet where you're born determines your prospects.","Education is the gateway to the American Dream. But today our immigration laws make higher education - a virtual requirement for financial security - out of reach for more than one million undocumented students.","We must broaden the definition of who our neighbors are, and extend the boundaries of our interest and empathy.","It's easier to poke holes in an idea than think of ways to fill them. And it's easier to focus on the 100 reasons you shouldn't do something rather than the one reason you should.","I'm happy to admit that I'm a hopeless optimist.","Fostering the leadership necessary for transformational outcomes in education is hard work, and in countries around the world, there is a constant search for easier solutions.","We look for people who demonstrate perseverance in the face of challenges, the ability to influence and motivate others - people who want to work relentlessly to ensure that kids who are facing the challenges of poverty have an excellent education.","Few things are more important to our country's future than recruiting and keeping great teachers in our schools.","There's no how-to guide for how to change the world. But it's easy to get hung up by misconceptions about what it takes to make an impact.","Throughout history, when societies have been faced with big challenges, they've put their best people on them. During the Space Race, American and Russian scientists, engineers, astronauts and cosmonauts pushed the bounds of what was possible and landed men on the moon.","Common Core reminds us what testing can do right. Modeled on standards of the world's education superpowers, questions demand critical thinking and creativity. Students are asked to write at length, show their work, and explain their reasoning.","Teach for America recruits top recent college grads, young professionals, people we believe are the U.S.'s most promising future leaders, and asks them to commit two years to teach in high-need urban and rural communities.","We should be individualizing instruction, utilizing that data to actually give teachers the tools necessary to meet the needs of a very diverse group of kids which exists in every class.","The mission that unites all of the programs of the Teach For All global network is that of cultivating the leadership capacity critical to ultimately ensuring educational opportunity for all.","People are everything in education, just as in the corporate world.","The lack of diversity in higher education is a problem we as a country must tackle if we're going to live up to our promise.","In the long run, we will need many more African-American, Latino, and Native American leaders, and leaders from low-income communities, who can bring additional insight and a deeply grounded sense of urgency, and who are the most likely to inspire the necessary trust and engagement among students' parents and community leaders.","Dartmouth is such a special college with its rich history, dedicated student body, and, as I've been learning more recently, colorful customs.","The idea that computers can ever replace teachers and schools reveals a deep lack of understanding about the role leadership plays in student success.","Technology has enormous potential to address educational needs more efficiently, help teachers improve their performance, and enrich and individualize student learning.","Competition and competitive rhetoric can be healthy. It's what drove the United States to pursue the Soviet Union into space, creating countless innovations along the way.","Education is the most powerful tool countries have for boosting economic growth, increasing prosperity, and forging more just, peaceful and equitable societies.","Mindsets, skills and leadership, experience and access, and critical consciousness - we need all four of these things for our students to be the leaders, people and citizens we want them to be.","Let the tech firms and consulting firms build your skills, but be sure to ask yourself, 'Am I maximizing my impact?' 'Am I living up to my values?'","Ending educational inequality is going to require systemic change and a long-term, sustained effort. There are no shortcuts and no silver bullets.","We collaborate with other countries on issues like public health and climate change because we understand these issues affect our collective welfare.","It's time to declare a cease-fire in the education arms race. We have far more to gain from collaborating to solve our common problems than competing for higher rankings.","It's Teach For America's responsibility to ensure that all alumni know their voices are heard and valued, and to surface the range of opinion they represent.","A core part of Teach For America's mission has always been affecting positive change in the traditional public school system.","We believe strongly in transparency and accountability, which is why Teach For America encourages rigorous independent evaluations of our program. Our mission is too important to operate in any other way.","We have found that the most successful teachers in low-income communities operate like successful leaders. They establish a vision of where their students will be performing at the end of the year that many believe to be unrealistic.","Our experience at Teach For America has been that the more people understand educational inequity, the more they want to do something about it.","When I started Teach For America as a college senior, I sensed that there were thousands of talented, driven college students and recent grads who were searching for a way to make a real difference in the world.","I think people are attracted to teaching because they want to make a real impact.","Some people seem to sort of have a gut for hiring. I literally had a gut that was exactly the opposite. So whenever I thought someone would be great, it was sort of the opposite.","We've done a lot of research on the characteristics of our teachers who are the most successful. The most predictive trait is still past demonstrated achievement, and all selection research basically points to that.","People think of teachers who are born to teach, and you think of all these charismatic folks. Some of the most successful teachers are some of the least charismatic, interestingly. But they have a gift of figuring out what motivates people.","Kids in urban and rural areas face so many challenges, and they show up at schools that don't have the extra capacity or extra resources to meet their needs.","Effective teacher support in my mind is the same thing as effective management. Our teachers need strong management, just like anyone in any profession.","Charter laws do something really important. They give educators the freedom and flexibility that they need to attain results. But we also have to invest a lot in the leadership pipeline to take advantage of that freedom and flexibility.","When kids are met with the highest expectations and given the extra supports they need, they can be as motivated as kids anywhere.","I think Teach for America has suffered from the fact that I did not teach, in a major way. I also think if I had taught, I wouldn't have started Teach for America.","It's possible to train great people, but a person with great training who doesn't have certain characteristics is only going to go so far.","If we freed up all the money in the certification process, think about how much more money we'd have to put into teacher salaries.","It gets to whether we're a teacher-education model or a movement for social justice. I would say we're about the latter.","Education must be the only sector that hasn't already been completely revolutionized by technology.","Whenever we've seen the kids in the most disadvantaged context truly excel, always it's been in classrooms and in whole schools where there is a clear vision of where the kids have the potential to be.","I think the way to understand Teach for America is as a leadership development program.","In the long run, we need to build a leadership force of people. We have a whole strategy around not only providing folks with the foundational experience during their two years with us, but also then accelerating their leadership in ways that is strategic for the broader education reform movement.","We are working essentially to build a leadership force of folks who will, during their first two years of teaching, actually put their kids on a different trajectory - not just survive as a new teacher, but actually help close the achievement gap for their kids.","Kids who live in low income areas face extra challenges and show up at schools that were not designed to meet their extra needs.","If we could reach the point where many of our nation's future leaders know what teachers know after teaching successfully in our highest-need schools, we would have a very different situation.","I've heard a number of our alumni - people who are running schools and school systems - think a lot about different models for the teaching profession.","I'll get up at 5 or 6. I try to catch up on sleep on the weekends, so I'll try to get seven hours of sleep. During the week, my ideal is to go to bed at 9 and wake up six hours later.","I usually don't really have breakfast.","We go around and talk about what are each of the kids most proud of from the previous week.","School boards can be a steppingstone to higher forms of political leadership.","We're looking for people out there who have demonstrated that they are leaders, have track records of achievement, and want to be part of a force... of a much larger force of determined people who want to bring about, ultimately, institutional change.","We're not trying to be the only route into teaching. We do put enormous energy into understanding what differentiates the most successful teachers.","In every case where I've seen a transformational school, there's a principal who really has the foundational experience of having taught successfully.","I had been very focused on the issue of education disparities in our country, and literally, by the time kids are just nine years old, in low-income communities, they're already three or four grade levels behind nine-year-olds in high-income communities.","All around the world, we send our top talent into finance, technology, medicine and law - everywhere but towards expanding opportunity for our most marginalized children.","Imagine how different those classrooms could be if hundreds of Nigeria's most talented recent graduates and professionals channeled their energy not only into the country's banks, but into making education in the country a force for transformation.","If we're going to see sustainable results from all the other investments we're making in education, we need to build leadership capacity in each and every country.","Our teachers are operating just as effective leaders in the business world do. They set a vision that most people think is crazy. They convince the kids why it's important to accomplish the goal. And they are totally relentless.","The teachers are trying to build the same culture in the classroom as we're building in the organization.","We're trying to be the top employer of recent grads in the country. Size gives us leverage to have a tangible impact on school systems.","When I started Teach For America, I wasn't trying to come up with an idea that would change the world. I was trying to solve a problem much closer to home: I was a senior in college, and I had no idea what I was going to do with my life!","In a society that glorifies the pioneers, it's easy to think that an endeavor is only worth pursuing if you can be the first to pursue it.","Persistent inequality costs the U.S. hundreds of billions of dollars a year, undermining our global competitiveness, our democracy, and our ideals as a nation."],"Wendy Liebman":["People always come up to me and say that my smoking is bothering them... Well, it's killing me!","My mother always said don't marry for money, divorce for money.","My mom was a ventriloquist and she always was throwing her voice. For ten years I thought the dog was telling me to kill my father.","I took an acting class. After the first day, the teacher quit, so they said take another. When I saw 'How to be a Stand-up Comedian,' it resonated. I realized I'd rather make 200 people laugh than make one person cry.","I've been on so many blind dates, I should get a free dog.","Is there a doctor in the house? My parents want me to marry you.","I don't think I was funny until college. I lived with some Harvard MD/PhD students - they were so smart, and what I contributed to the house was, I was the funny one.","I think there have always been funny women, from Carol Burnett to Joan Rivers. When the audience sees a woman, they innately know she's worked twice as hard to get there, she's had to prove that she can be the leader, first, and then be funny on top of it. She has to emit a confidence that she's in control.","I've been pitching a show of five female stand-up comedians through the generations, from Phyllis Diller to Amy Schumer, so when I got an e-mail asking me if I would participate in the Women in Comedy Festival, I was thrilled."],"Wendy Long":["Serious people need to work hard to reduce the debt, reduce taxes, and slash regulation on the small businesses and families that are the lifeblood of new jobs and innovation in our state.","Good judges do not side with anyone.

It's not really something I want to do. I don't love the idea of being a U.S. senator; I love the idea of being a mother.","I've never really fit in.","I had a dream to become a mounted policewoman.","My son was 8 or 9, and he really wanted a gun. It was Christmas, and I said to my husband, 'It's time for a gun.'","How great would it be to have a native son lead us out of turmoil and trouble to peace and justice?

This is the path Donald Trump has set for our great nation, and it's the same path I'm on.","Christians are being persecuted, not just in the Middle East but here in this country.","If Roe v. Wade were overturned tomorrow, nobody would even notice, because the states are legislating their own laws about abortion, completely independent.","Thinking of ourselves as members of 'this group' or 'that group,' I think that's a recipe for division.","The thing is that Chuck Schumer, for all his power and influence, is a pretty pathetic figure. You go around New York State, and people make jokes about him and talk about how he shows up at the New York State Fair and has a staffer carrying a big sign saying 'Come meet Chuck Schumer.'","We have to have legal immigration, which has to be something that benefits our country.","Looking at the history of our country, we have been and we are pro-immigrant, but we aren't going to be much of a country if we don't take care of our own people first and if we don't observe the rule of law.","The #NeverTrump crowd is running out of steam - and time. All of its attacks - that he's as liberal as Hillary Clinton, anti-immigrant, or a con man who will say anything to be elected - have failed.","If we can be sure of anything, it's that the immense challenges faced by our country and our nation cannot be solved by the same people in the same offices, casting the same votes for the same failed policies.","Judge Sotomayor is a liberal judicial activist of the first order who thinks her own personal political agenda is more important that the law as written.","Kirsten Gillibrand and I are very similar in our biographies. We're both mothers, we're both lawyers. But we couldn't be more different in our beliefs, in our principles, in our politics.","Whether it's federal highway funds for the Thruway or Tappan Zee bridge project or the corrupt Cornhusker deal, Senator Gillibrand is willing to sell out our hardworking families. She has failed to address the problem that taxpayers in New York send much more to Washington that we get back.","As New York's United States Senator, I promise to reinstate the Moynihan 'Fisc Report' and work every day to address the imbalance of payments, first by focusing on reducing the amount of taxes we send to Washington, and second, by ensuring that funding formulas don't disadvantage New York.","New York City is the financial capital of the world. The Dodd-Frank Act, I think, is going to change that. It's going to send jobs to London and Geneva and Hong Kong and Sydney instead of keeping New York the financial center of the world.","We are in desperate need of a return to limited, constitutional government.","With so many serious issues and responsibilities before the United States Senate, I think New York needs an independent senator who thinks for herself, not someone who just rubberstamps the Obama agenda or checks with Chuck Schumer and says, 'Me too.'","If you have empathy for both sides, then that's the same as having no empathy at all.","A judge is supposed to have empathy for no one but simply to follow the law.","The best way to have empathy for people and the best way to have empathy for our Constitution is to appoint judges who will rule based on the law and to have empathy, if you will, for the law only and to rule based on the law.","Lady Justice doesn't have empathy for anyone. She rules strictly based upon the law, and that's really the only way that our system can function properly under the Constitution.","Many Americans have sensed there is a very corrupt pay-to-play system going on in Washington.","Our government is corrupt.","Chuck Schumer is the face of the ruling class.","I'm here to speak for those who say the American Dream isn't working for them, because I know it isn't. I'm here to say it's not your fault: the ruling class... has failed you.","Having been on the front lines of the confirmation battles involving Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito, I know firsthand what is at stake when the Senate exercises its 'advise and consent' power over federal judges.","I will stand up for judges who faithfully follow the law as it is written.","The immigration laws of the United States should not be used to buy and sell political favors.","The whole idea behind the EB-5 visa was to help create jobs in economically disadvantaged areas. But where big bucks are involved, corruption soon follows, and with Chuck Schumer and the EB-5 visa program, you need to follow the money.","I would end the EB-5 program altogether, if we cannot establish that it can be used only to bring development to impoverished places where it otherwise truly would not occur under normal American market forces.","I guess I was a little idealistic and thought if you are honest and you're well-qualified and capable of waging a good fight, you can raise money. And what I learned is that our campaign finance laws are really a great big incumbent protection act.","The power of incumbency and the power of money is just overwhelming.","I think Republicans make a mistake when they seek to be 'Democrat light.'","New York voters agree on this: There is too much corruption in government - federal, state, and local.","We've always said a filibuster is not appropriate for judicial nominees. A filibuster is a legislative tool designed to extract compromises. A judicial nominee is a person. You can't take the arm or leg of a nominee.","I'm on the Trump team.","Paul Ryan has been a responsible legislator and public servant, almost alone among members of Congress in his belief that we need to strengthen and save our social entitlements.","Government has crowded out the role of many social institutions, including the Church, that have been a great force for good in public life.","How does a religious employer's decision not to offer health plans with abortion coverage dictate to anyone what to do with her own body?","I converted to Catholicism at age 35, after being raised as a Congregationalist in a New England Yankee family.","What I do know is that liberal Democrat policies in our big cities are not helping anybody, especially our big cities.","I've enjoyed the benefits of this country, which has been very good to me.","I believe in the idea of sacrifice and fighting for what's right and giving something back to the country that's given me so much.","I would drastically revise much of the Dodd-Frank financial-reform legislation, which I call the 'Bureaucrat Full Employment Act.'","Senator Gillibrand is good at saying things that sound nice but have little substance. I don't think we elect our public officials to avoid taking a stand or a difficult position on anything.","New York is a place where people have strong convictions.","Judges should follow the law in deciding cases - not their own values, good or bad.","Obama and Biden want a bench crammed full of liberal judicial activists, and it's up to the American people to tell them 'no.'","The American people have made clear that they want justices who have proven records of judicial restraint - exactly the kind of justices that Obama and Biden cannot abide.","Republicans can nominate bad Justices, too. Earl Warren, William Brennan, Harry Blackmun, David Souter... the list goes on.","Conservatives who care about nominations of judges who practice judicial restraint are, constitutionally, restrained people themselves.","The Supreme Court overrules, distinguishes, and upholds prior precedents. Sometimes it ignores them. But it does not - cannot - 'defy' them.","In a nation based on the 'consent of the governed,' judges are supposed to apply the laws the people have assented to.","Mainstream America, in the long run, will always stand for highly qualified, impartial judges and for a fair process and for senators who do their jobs and vote - not who unfairly smear good men like Judge Alito."],"Wendy O. Williams":["I'm trying to encourage more women to be themselves, rather than what men want them to be. I don't believe in patronizing either sex.","Basically, I hate conformity.

So-called normal behaviour patterns make me so bored, I could throw up!","I'm more interested in having a place to work out my voice and my body than I am in having furniture.","The important thing is to build up my cardiovascular system, so I have the stamina to do stunts. To me, stepping over the line, taking a chance and succeeding is the ultimate freedom, be it in rock and roll or when executing a really challenging routine.","Ever since I was little, I've always liked to smash things.","I never strike out at any life form. The only things I attack are icons of conspicuous consumption. People put objects in front of their life, in front of anything that has real importance.

I love stories of the underdog coming out on top and stories of survival.","I'm very easy going and low maintenance when it comes to my hair.","I love theatre because that is my foundation. So, if I had to make a choice in terms of where I get the most fulfillments, it would be theatre. The reaction is so immediate, unlike with TV and film.","There is always a new flavor of the month, especially in film.","I started in dance classes when I was, like, seven years old. And the arts in general, it kept me not only off the street, I grew up in South Central Los Angeles, so it kept my mind focused. It kept me passionate about something. So I wasn't easily distracted.","When I think of black television and history, I always use 'The Cosby Show' as the bar.","As of late, 'Boyz n the Hood' really impacted me because I grew up in that same neighborhood. It was the first time I saw a true reflection of me, my neighborhood and my surroundings."],"Wendy Robie":["When 'Twin Peaks' happened the first time, I was a stage actor in Seattle. I was called in for an audition for this pilot, and at that time, it was called 'Northwest Passage,' and nobody knew anything. I thought, 'Oh, okay, Lewis and Clark.' And from that moment, I fell down the rabbit hole.","When someone offers me a part, I say, 'Yes, please.'","I'm always glad to work.","The people of Butler Island spoke to me and demanded I bear witness for them.","I believe race is the great social problem of the 20th century.

Everything led me to the place where I am now.","Certain people have certain ways of focusing on things, and some arrange their lens to a pinhole in order to focus only on their goal. Others have a giant lens, and they take in the whole panorama. I was that pinhole kind of person.","Aging gracefully means being flexible, being open, allowing change, enjoying change and loving yourself.","The moment is everything. Don't think about tomorrow; don't think about yesterday: think about exactly what you're doing right now and live it and dance it and breath it and be it.","I've let my body soften. I've let it relax.","When you are a kid, you find so much comfort in dancing. I was comforted.","I've always felt like a different kind of ballerina.","I was dancing on Broadway for many years. Then everyone was either getting injured or retiring, and I was dancing with younger dancers.","You have to decide when it is time to move on.","I always looked at the process and the career of being a ballerina as sacred. It's a true gift to have this talent and perform these masterworks; it's sublime.","As I aged and I got stronger artistically, I really started to value my voice in performance - my 'voice' meaning my body, my technique, and my style. Then I started to really feel that flower as well. That's when I started to feel like, 'Wow - now I understand what my beauty is.'","So much is made about the beginnings of ballet careers, the rosebud, and then once the petals and leaves start falling off, is it beautiful anymore? Some people think it is; some people don't. The expectation is to focus on the very beautiful parts, not the ending.","I have a lot of energy, a lot of interest, a lot of desire.","I liked the structure of ballet.","Being a ballerina, you don't ever want to show yourself less than perfect, ever. That's what your goal is: 24/7 perfection.","I feel the ticking clock. And at times, I've said if I don't dance, I'd rather die.","I think the leotard for me became, after I retired, a sort of a symbol of the confines of still fitting into the ballet world in mind and body.","My art form is my child, and that's what I give my focus to.","I knew I wanted to be a ballet dancer, but what kind, I wasn't sure. My two dream companies had been New York City Ballet and American Ballet Theater.","Any time I've performed on one of the major stages, whether it be Covent Garden or the Paris Opera or the Bolshoi or the Mariinsky, those are really the top memorable moments for me.","I really only had one audition in my life, and that was when I was 14 or 15. When I was that young, I listened to what my teachers would say, like wearing a certain kind of leotard that you'll be noticed in.","A lot of my career and my drive and my passion and my striving to be better and better was built on insecurity.","I love that moment of, 'Remember when?' I love to waft.","There are many ways to lead a life. It would always be ideal to have a paycheck coming in. But I really love this fly-by-the-seat-of-the-pants approach. It's scary and wonderful at the same time. I feel very open to many possibilities.","I was so comfortable with my ballet power, my dancer power, that to have a voice, the comfort with having a voice, is slower to come to me.","I really miss dancing all day long. But something I really love is not dancing all day long. I love that I can't rely on dancing all day long to stay creative.","Sometimes I miss being en pointe, but not a whole lot. Every once and a while, I would love to float for a minute on a shoe. But for the most part, I did it long enough that it's OK.","As ballerinas, we don't use our voices. Our voice is the body and the movement quality."],"Wentworth Miller":["I feel extremely lucky, extremely grateful, and a little bittersweet, too.","A great book provides escapism for me. The artistry and the creativity in a story are better than any drugs.","I have very high expectations of myself. I'm a very competitive person but competitive with myself. I want to be the best that I can be and if that means that I'm eventually better than everyone else then so be it.","Prison has a universal fascination. It's a real-life horror story because, given the right set of circumstances, anyone could find themselves behind bars.","I'm a very competitive person, but competitive with myself. I want to be the best that I can be, and if that means that I'm eventually better than everyone else, then so be it. But I don't go around comparing and contrasting myself with other actors if I can help it. It's also, I think, the key to my success.","Confidence is at the root of so many attractive qualities, a sense of humor, a sense of style, a willingness to be who you are no matter what anyone else might think or say and it's true, I do have a certain fondness for women that have dark hair.","When I've had my periods of unemployment, I'll get these e-mails from my father: 'I've read that the LAPD has a reservist program. Perhaps that's something you'd be interested in taking a look at.'","You only cry for help if you believe there is help to cry for.","I'm kind of a dork. I don't have much game. I'm not particularly comfortable in bars or clubs. I much prefer being home playing Scrabble, having dinner with a couple friends, going to see a movie, or losing a whole weekend to Season 14 of Law and Order or The Simpsons.","There's so much we can't express in our day-to-day interaction with people because it's considered inappropriate. And acting is all about being inappropriate.","To be honest, I find going out pretty scary and intimidating. Got all those people checking you out, with only one purpose: hooking up. I'm quite the dork, I'd rather sit home and play Scrabble. But that doesn't get you a girl, does it?","Growing up, I was a target. Speaking the right way, standing the right way, holding your wrist the right way. Every day was a test, and there were a thousand ways to fail, a thousand ways to betray yourself, to not live up to someone else's standards of what was accepted, of what was normal.","Acting was something I needed like air. It wasn't something I could walk away from.","You have to love what you do, and you have to need it like you need air. And there's nothing else that would give me the same degree of satisfaction as acting, which is why I can't walk away from it.","There'll be moments when I'm out in the prison yard, chatting with the cast and the crew, getting ready to shoot a scene. And then I'll remember if I were actually an inmate, I'd only be out there an hour. The other 23 hours of the day, I'd be in my cell. It's kind of a downer.","My family put a lot of emphasis on homework, so there weren't too many comic books or video games for me, when I was growing up.","I'm pretty much a couch potato.","My encounters with racism are sort of second-hand situations where I might be standing around with a group of white friends and someone makes a comment that they wouldn't make at my family reunion.","I've been spared to a large extent the business end of the race stick.","I broke my nose in gym when a ball hit me. I took a girl to her debutante ball the next week wearing a tux and a big, honking bandage. Not the romantic night she had in mind.","I feel as though we're living in a time where there is very little distinction paid between the personal and the professional.","I think there's something about evil that is thoughtless and relentless and incredibly frightening because it can't be reckoned with, reasoned with or stopped.","I am a workaholic, have always been.","I noticed that I got a better space in the line in Starbucks when I had my tattoo. People associate tattoos with a certain edge. Then I open my mouth, and something completely different comes out.","Michael Scofield is someone everyone can relate to, but nobody would want to be in his shoes.","My definition of cool is finding your own definition of cool and not necessarily taking your lead from what other people tell you or from what you might read from magazines or see on TV.","A racial community provides not only a sense of identity, that luxury of looking into another's face and seeing yourself reflected back, but a sense of security and support.","Everyone has their challenges.","Four months of preparation and about 12 hours of shooting turned into about 30 seconds of screen time.","I've been spoiled by this project. I was given the script and went in to read, realizing that this was a powerful story and one that wasn't told very often.","I worked with the same trainer that worked with Denzel Washington in THe Hurricane. It was three months of training, five days a week, 4 to 5 hours a day. This was followed by a month of choreography.","If I were to wait only for roles that clarify my racial makeup, I'd be waiting for a very, very long time.","My father is black and my mother is white. Therefore, I could answer to either, which kind of makes me a racial Lone Ranger, caught between two communities.","Nobody's ever asked me to pay for a meal before I've eaten it, I've never been pulled over just because I was driving the wrong kind of car in the wrong kind of area at the wrong time of night.","There has to be a measure of faith. That's what this business is all about: trusting in something that may never show up, that you have no concrete proof of.","They told me at the end of that test that they wanted me to be a part of this project. I walked out and had a moment of clarity where I thought, not many people will ever have this moment.","This role is more visible, and I grew up without a lot of that sort of modeling so I'm relieved and proud to have done this film.","You're confronted with the quandary: do I grind things to a halt? Ideally you would, but I have better things to do than educate people.","I hadn't worked for a year when I had my Prison Break audition and it was the easiest audition I've ever had. I got the script on Friday, went to the audition on Monday and got the part on Tuesday. I was shooting the pilot a week later. I didn't have time to be nervous - it happened so quickly.","I have to laugh internally when I'm asked in interviews what nightspots I like to hit. I just don't have answers... so sometimes I make them up.","I made a decision not to work out because I'm lazy and also, the character is not a superhero. I didn't want him to be a buff guy with Jackie Chan moves because the point is he's smarter than your average Joe.","I want to aspire to something like what Denzel Washington does, which is try to find scripts written for white actors - or Jodie Foster, who reads scripts for male actors.","I'm neither sexy nor a star.","I'm very pleased with being a part of the Bean Pole family. It's a relationship that makes sense to me. I'm very pleased to have my name associated with Bean Pole Jeans.","I've never seen American Idol but I am grateful to them. That show is one of Fox's biggest moneymakers, and some of that money goes to pay for shows like Prison Break. Simon Cowell's been signing my paychecks and for that I say thanks.","In my career as an actor, there is a catchphrase that Scofield always says often in regards to his brother, 'Have a little faith.' In my own career as an actor, there were times when I was the only one who believed in myself in the face of the odds.","It was just expected that I would go to college. Both my parents are teachers and they tolerated acting, but I was going to go to a school of quality or bust. Which made my downshifting back to acting afterward a little difficult.","My character in 'Prison Break' needs to be formidable. In reality, I'm not very tough at all.","Prison Break is so far-fetched, I had to make viewers believe that Michael is capable of making the impossible possible.","When I got to college, acting suddenly seemed like a very risky proposition and all my friends were going to law school or med school or Wall Street.","I'm hoping that what I am or what I'm not ethnically doesn't limit me in anyone else's eyes. I guarantee you it doesn't in mine.","Entertainers are there to entertain. They aren't there to teach your children the lessons that you haven't bothered to teach them at home yourself.","I didn't come to Hollywood to get on magazine covers or start my Porsche collection or to enjoy that kind of lifestyle, to go to the right parties and meet the right people.","I spend my weekends sleeping and watching DVDs, and eating at restaurants within a 2-block radius of my apartment.","I think what you learn, working on a film or TV set, is how to tune certain things out. You've got 60-100 people swirling around you, each of them with a very important job to do.","It's the way the business works, you're not just an actor, you're a diplomat and a publicist and a politician, and there are certain expectations.","An actor's job is to embrace emotions and situations that in real life we spend all of our time running away from.","I surrender the idea of having some kind of control over the arc of my career a lot of the time because you never know what tomorrow's going to bring.","I think it's a very dangerous game to play when you assume that just because someone's an entertainer, they're automatically a role model. Entertainers are there to entertain. They aren't there to teach your children the lessons that you haven't bothered to teach them at home yourself. They're just doing their own version of entertaining.","I've never tried writing at a coffeehouse. I just know instinctively it's not for me.","I revise obsessively. It's important to me to have a clean page.","I've never read a book or attended a class on screenwriting. I'm not opposed to the idea, but I like what I've got going on naturally and want to protect that. The one question I will ask myself as I'm re-reading a script for the 60th time is, 'Am I entertained? Still?' If the answer is 'yes,' I'll assume other people will be, too.","There's nothing the Internet can tell me about myself that I don't already know. The rest is foolishness and people killing time.","My first gig in the business was a guest star on 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer,' so I'm neck deep in sci-fi. It's been a very good genre to me.","I wanted to be involved in TV and film in some capacity, so a compromise, because acting seemed unrealistic, and so risky, was to get into the production side. And it was a really fortunate, smart move looking back on it, because it gave me perspective on another side of the business.","I know what it takes to go from the point where someone's looking at a newspaper article, and thinking, 'Oh, this would make a great TV series,' to the point where you're actually on a set and there's a camera aimed at someone.","The mail amazes me. I sometimes get these letters that are ten pages, and handwritten, from women pouring their hearts out and, for security reasons, I can only respond with a headshot and 'Dear so and so, be good. WM.' It never feels like enough.","Unfortunately, I'm allergic to all animals and even some people.","I acted all the way up until Princeton. It was just one of my favorite extracurricular activities. Then I got to Princeton and had a really conservative vibe. All my friends were planning on law school, med school, or Wall Street, and suddenly acting seem like a really risky proposition.","I'm one of those actors who's going to have to create a space for themselves. It's very easy to be the young Tom Cruise, because Hollywood knows what to do with you. But if you're someone who's bringing someone slightly left of center to the table, you're not a sure thing.","I certainly learned how to break down a text at Princeton, which helps me break down a script - or at least that's the line I feed my parents when they start wondering where all that good money went.","Professionally speaking, the proudest moment was when I booked the 'Human Stain.' I knew it had Nicole Kidman, Anthony Hopkins, Ed Harris and Gary Sinise on board, and the director Robert Benton was an academy award winner for 'Kramer vs Kramer.'","I had a brief experience in the food industry. I was a bus boy in a Mexican restaurant in Arizona, scraping re-fried beans off people's plates. It teaches you a bit of humility and the importance of a good deodorant."],"Werner Arber":["From 1949 to 1953, I studied towards the diploma in Natural Sciences at the Swiss Polytechnical School in Zurich. It is in the last year of this study that I made my first contacts with fundamental research, when working on the isolation and characterization of a new isomer of Cl34 with a half-life of 1.5 seconds.","I was born on June 3rd, 1929, in Graenichen in the Canton of Aargau, Switzerland, where I went to the public schools until the age of 16.","On the recommendation of my professor in experimental physics, Paul Scherrer, I took an assistantship for electron microscopy at the Biophysics Laboratory at the University of Geneva in November 1953. This laboratory was animated by Eduard Kellenberger, and it had two prototype electron microscopes requiring much attention.","In the 1950s, the Biophysics Laboratory at the University of Geneva was lucky enough to receive each summer for several months the visit of Jean Weigle. He was the former professor of experimental physics at the University of Geneva."],"Werner Erhard":["Ride the horse in the direction that it's going.","Create your future from your future not your past.","You don't have to go looking for love when it's where you come from.","Your life works to the degree you keep your agreements."],"Werner Heisenberg":["Natural science, does not simply describe and explain nature; it is part of the interplay between nature and ourselves.","The solution of the difficulty is that the two mental pictures which experiment lead us to form - the one of the particles, the other of the waves - are both incomplete and have only the validity of analogies which are accurate only in limiting cases.","Whoever dedicates his life to searching out particular connections of nature will spontaneously be confronted with the question how they harmoniously fit into the whole.","It is seen that both matter and radiation possess a remarkable duality of character, as they sometimes exhibit the properties of waves, at other times those of particles. Now, it is obvious that a thing cannot be a form of wave motion and composed of particles at the same time - the two concepts are too different.","What we observe is not nature itself, but nature exposed to our method of questioning.","The German physicists knew at least so much about the manufacture and construction of atomic bombs that it was clear to them that the manufacture of bombs in Germany could not succeed during the war. For this reason, they were spared the moral decision whether they should make an atomic bomb, and they had only worked on the uranium engine.","If we made atomic bombs, we would bring about a terrible change in the world. Who knows what would happen from this?","The uncertainty principle refers to the degree of indeterminateness in the possible present knowledge of the simultaneous values of various quantities with which the quantum theory deals; it does not restrict, for example, the exactness of a position measurement alone or a velocity measurement alone.","I would say that I was absolutely convinced of the possibility of our making an uranium engine, but I never thought that we would make a bomb; and at the bottom of my heart, I was really glad that it was to be an engine and not a bomb.","Certainly, in the course of time, the splendid things will separate from the hateful.","It is true that in quantum theory we cannot rely on strict causality. But by repeating the experiments many times, we can finally derive from the observations statistical distributions, and by repeating such series of experiments, we can arrive at objective statements concerning these distributions.","The uncertainty relation does not refer to the past; if the velocity of the electron is at first known and the position then exactly measured, the position for times previous to the measurement may be calculated.","The single life is bearable to me only through my work in science, but for the long term, it would be very bad if I had to make do without a very young person next to me.","The problems of language here are really serious. We wish to speak in some way about the structure of the atoms. But we cannot speak about atoms in ordinary language.","It is generally believed that our science is empirical and that we draw our concepts and our mathematical constructs from the empirical data. If this were the whole truth, we should, when entering into a new field, introduce only such quantities as can directly be observed, and formulate natural laws only by means of these quantities.","There is a great difference between discoveries and inventions. With discoveries, one can always be skeptical, and many surprises can take place. In the case of inventions, surprises can really only occur for people who have not had anything to do with it.","Bohr's influence on the physics and the physicists of our century was stronger than that of anyone else, even than that of Albert Einstein.","If the lecture is good, then everything is too smooth. That's the same in music: if the performance is too good, you really don't enjoy it, because it just goes by, and you can never penetrate into the heart of it. Sometimes a poor performance is better for enjoyment, because you can look at those things that were wrong and analyze them.","This proving of such and such I found to be almost like cheating. You start somewhere, and then you go into a dark tunnel, and then you come out at another place. You find that you have proved what you wanted to prove, but in the tunnel, you don't see anything.","After I had written a paper or letter for Bohr, I always had the impression that I had learned something which I could use for my own work. And somehow, I never felt that I had too little time for my own work. I always found time.","The end of the First World War had thrown Germany's youth into great turmoil. The reins of power had fallen from the hands of a deeply disillusioned older generation, and the younger ones drew together in larger and smaller groups to blaze new paths or, at least, to discover a new star to steer by.","Every word or concept, clear as it may seem to be, has only a limited range of applicability.","The violent reaction on the recent development of modern physics can only be understood when one realises that here the foundations of physics have started moving; and that this motion has caused the feeling that the ground would be cut from science.","One may say that in a state of science where fundamental concepts have to be changed, tradition is both the condition for progress and a hindrance. Hence, it usually takes a long time before the new concepts are generally accepted.","I would like to mention astrophysics; in this field, the strange properties of the pulsars and quasars, and perhaps also the gravitational waves, can be considered as a challenge.","Although the theory of relativity makes the greatest of demands on the ability for abstract thought, still it fulfills the traditional requirements of science insofar as it permits a division of the world into subject and object (observer and observed) and, hence, a clear formulation of the law of causality.","In America, it was decided to attempt the production of atomic bombs with an effort that would constitute a large part of the collective American war effort. In Germany, an effort one thousandth the scale of the American was applied to the problem of producing atomic energy that would drive engines.","Reports in Washington show that our reasoning was just like that of your physicists. With all this information available, at least to privileged persons, I cannot understand why it is generally held in the United States that we completely missed the basic principle of the bomb until after Hiroshima.","I believe this uranium business will give the Anglo-Saxons such tremendous power that Europe will become a bloc under Anglo-Saxon domination. If that is the case, it will be a very good thing. I wonder whether Stalin will be able to stand up to the others as he has done in the past.","The Anglo-Americans want the balance of power in Eurasia. The only balance of power they can achieve now is the whole of Europe against Russia. The only choice for us is either to join this Western European bloc or join in with Russia.","I think that if a United States of Europe were to be formed, it would be in our interests to fight for it, as all our old traditions would remain in such a united Europe, whereas if we were to start now as part of the Russian Empire, everything that had ever been in Germany would disappear.","Our house was destroyed in 1943, and I moved the family to a cottage I owned before the war in the Bavarian Alps. This cottage was meant for a very few people, and at the end of the war, there were about 13 people in this very small house.","I had imagined doing nuclear physics and cosmic ray work in greater style in peace time. To do modern physics in a small way is of no use of all.","In 1924, I became a Dozent in Gottingen and worked out the quantum mechanics during a holiday stay on Heligoland.","For Germany, the war was like an end game in chess in which she possessed one castle less than her adversary. The loss of the war was as certain as the loss of an end game under these conditions."],"Werner Herzog":["Every man should pull a boat over a mountain once in his life.","The world reveals itself to those who travel on foot.","If you do not have an absolutely clear vision of something, where you can follow the light to the end of the tunnel, then it doesn't matter whether you're bold or cowardly, or whether you're stupid or intelligent. Doesn't get you anywhere.","Civilization is like a thin layer of ice upon a deep ocean of chaos and darkness.","Sometimes bad luck hits you like in an ancient Greek tragedy, and it's not your own making. When you have a plane crash, it's not your fault.","You must live life in its very elementary forms. The Mexicans have a very nice word for it: pura vida. It doesn't mean just purity of life, but the raw, stark-naked quality of life. And that's what makes young people more into a filmmaker than academia.","Life on our planet has been a constant series of cataclysmic events, and we are more suitable for extinction than a trilobite or a reptile. So we will vanish. There's no doubt in my heart.","I don't spend sleepless nights over getting very bad reviews.","I think it is a quest of literature throughout the ages to describe the human condition.","I despise formal restaurants. I find all of that formality to be very base and vile. I would much rather eat potato chips on the sidewalk.","I think the worst that can happen in filmmaking is if you're working with a storyboard. That kills all intuition, all fantasy, all creativity.","I prefer to be alive, so I'm cautious about taking risks.","Ambition is to be the fastest runner on this planet, to be the first on the South Pole, which is a grotesque perversion of ambition. It's an ego trip, and I'm not on an ego trip. I don't have ambitions - I have a vision.","I'm not into digital marketing, downloading, or streaming - I've always been a man of the theaters.","Yes, the pyramids have been built, but if you give me 300,000 disciplined men and give me 30 years, I could build a bigger one.","I'm not an interviewer. I have conversations.","The universe is monstrously indifferent to the presence of man.","You should bear in mind that almost all my documentaries are feature films in disguise.","Technology has a great advantage in that we are capable of creating dinosaurs and show them on the screen even though they are extinct 65 million years. All of a sudden, we have a fantastic tool that is as good as dreams are.","Perhaps I seek certain utopian things, space for human honour and respect, landscapes not yet offended, planets that do not exist yet, dreamed landscapes.","I travel without barely any luggage. Just a second set of underwear and binoculars and a map and a toothbrush.","The universe is not harmonious: you know that by looking outside.","I never have searched for a subject. They always just come along. They never come by way of decision-making. They just haunt me. I can't get rid of them. I did not invite them.","Film should be looked at straight on; it is not the art of scholars but of illiterates.","I live my life outside of the glitz and glamour of the red carpet events, and so you'll never see me there. I'm never at parties.","I could not become an American citizen. I would not like to become a citizen of a country that has capital punishment.","Why go to Antarctica, why do a film like 'Grizzly Man'? It's the sheer joy of storytelling - it's the urge.","I think there are specific times where film noir is a natural concomitant of the mood. When there's insecurity, collapse of financial systems - that's where film noir always hits fertile ground.","I think psychology and self-reflection is one of the major catastrophes of the twentieth century.","I think there should be holy war against yoga classes.","Let's put it this way: art house theaters are vanishing. They have almost disappeared completely, and that means there's a shift in what audiences want to see. And they have to be aware of that and be realistic. It's as simple as that.","I cannot work fast enough. I cannot cope fast enough, really. And just releasing a film is hard.","I know whenever it comes to be really dysfunctional and vile and base and hostile on screen, I'm good at that!","There are certainly laws and elements that make a film more accessible to mainstream audiences. If you've got Tom Cruise as a strongman, I'm sure it would have larger audiences, but it wouldn't have the same substance.","You should look straight at a film; that's the only way to see one. Film is not the art of scholars but of illiterates.","Facts sometimes have a strange and bizarre power that makes their inherent truth seem unbelievable.","I'm not a journalist; I'm a poet.","I'm a very professional man. I'm not out for the experience of adventure.","I'm simply not afraid. It's not in my dictionary of behaviour.","I'm politically interested, but I have no particular talent as a political beast, stepping out and running for office.","I'm not an activist.","I'm not very eager to sit and look at my films all the time.","I like and I love everything that has to do with cinema: writing, directing, editing, creating music, and even acting.","I'm the last one who would do self-analysis.","I find it interesting that there are impostors out on the Internet pretending to be Werner Herzog.","If an actor knows how to milk a cow, I always know it will not be difficult to be in business with him.","I have nothing against 3D films but I do not need to see them.","I work very fast and steadily, and I don't hardly ever notice that I'm working. It feels like just breathing or walking when I do films.","I do other sorts of things. I act in other people's movies. I direct operas. I write books.","I have a great map of the Tibesti Mountains in the southern Sahara or Northern Chad. It's a dream of mine to go there, but it's such a volatile area, you have to be prudent."],"Werner Klemperer":["You know, I find it so difficult being a... as a matter of fact, little do people know that most of the leading members of the cast have a background that they would never expect them to have, and play the show they did.","But when they offered this little situation for me to do this voice in this special segment, I found it so incredibly humorous that I said yes, and I enjoyed it. It was fun.","I think that's so strange, because they do know that we're all actors and we perform things that have not necessarily anything to do with us personally.","I'm very surprised at that, yes, because there were many chances for it to be in Germany once the syndication market started and it continually just did not happen.","The fact that I have such a problem that people... that that has to, you know, be on people's mind, what my personal background is. To me, to be very frank with you, is a totally irrelevant thing.","When you mean a show like this, you have to say to me a show exactly like this, the way it was done."],"Wernher von Braun":["Research is what I'm doing when I don't know what I'm doing.","I have learned to use the word 'impossible' with the greatest caution.","It will free man from the remaining chains, the chains of gravity which still tie him to this planet.","We can lick gravity, but sometimes the paperwork is overwhelming.","For my confirmation, I didn't get a watch and my first pair of long pants, like most Lutheran boys. I got a telescope. My mother thought it would make the best gift.","There is just one thing I can promise you about the outer-space program - your tax-dollar will go further."],"Wes Anderson":["There's no story if there isn't some conflict. The memorable things are usually not how pulled together everybody is. I think everybody feels lonely and trapped sometimes. I would think it's more or less the norm.","I have a way of filming things and staging them and designing sets. There were times when I thought I should change my approach, but in fact, this is what I like to do. It's sort of like my handwriting as a movie director. And somewhere along the way, I think I've made the decision: I'm going to write in my own handwriting.","Paris is a place where, for me, just walking down a street that I've never been down before is like going to a movie or something. Just wandering the city is entertainment.","That's the kind of movie that I like to make, where there is an invented reality and the audience is going to go someplace where hopefully they've never been before. The details, that's what the world is made of.","I wouldn't say that I'm particularly bothered or obsessed with detail.","The subject of an outsider who becomes obsessed.","When you're 11 or 12 years old, you can get so swept up in a book that you start to believe that the fantasy is reality. I think when you have a giant crush when you're in fifth grade, it becomes your whole world. It's like being underwater; everything is different.","I have always wanted to work in the theater. I've always felt the glamour of being backstage and that excitement, but I've never actually done it - not since I was in 5th grade, really. But I've had many plays in my films. I feel like maybe theater is a part of my movie work.","Usually when I'm making a movie, what I have in mind first, for the visuals, is how we can stage the scenes to bring them more to life in the most interesting way, and then how we can make a world for the story that the audience hasn't quite been in before.","Any romantic feelings for a 12-year-old are like entering into a fantasy world.","Sometimes when you're editing a movie, you have the thing that you don't expect - which is you make it longer and longer as you go along.","On Fantastic Mr. Fox, I got used to working with animated storyboards as a way of planning for the shoot. We did a lot of sequences that way with this movie. Partly as a result of that, I decided to build more sets in order to do certain shots.","I love working with actors. That's what the set really is, for me. It's my time with the actors.","One of the things I enjoyed the most is just working as an actor.","And Hackman had really choked up when he was telling it. It was very moving.","When I see the first dailies on any movie, I usually feel that I had no idea how this combination of ingredients was going to mix together, what it was going to produce.","Kids are always open to anything. It's very rare that a kid isn't extremely eager to make you happy.","I don't know what is in store for the movie business any better than anybody else does, but it does seem like my kind of movies are a little trickier than it used to be - or maybe a lot trickier.","I've never had a movie that got great reviews. I've had movies that got different levels of good and bad reviews, but you can more or less count on plenty of bad reviews.","My experience with casting children is that... the whole movie is going to rest on their shoulders, so you have to set aside time and wait for the perfect people to appear.","I will say that Edward Norton, who plays the scout master, would be a first-rate Eagle Scout. He's got all those techniques. If your plane crashes into the jungle somewhere, he would be the guy you would want to have with you.","Every time you do a take on a movie, you're not sure if it's going to succeed. Even if you have a great cast, like we had, every scene you're kind of waiting for the release. 'Oh, yes; it happened. We got it!' There's always the possibility that it's just not going to work.","I'd never heard anything about this at all.","I guess when I think about it, one of the things I like to dramatise, and what is sometimes funny, is someone coming unglued. I don't consider myself someone who is making the argument that I support these choices. I just think it can be funny.","Anytime I make a movie, I really have absolutely no idea how it's going to go over. I've had the whole range of different kinds of reactions.","I usually set aside a lot of time in advance of a movie with important roles for kids to search, but when you have great ones, they can be a real ace in the hole."],"Wes Ball":["I had this project called 'Ruin' in my head for six years or so. This really big, really ambitious sci-fi thing. It's kind of my 'Star Wars'. I'm trying to achieve what 'Star Wars' did for me as a kid.","We storyboard a lot, but I love when we are just going in there and just, almost on the fly, making stuff and discovering moments. It's just fantastic, where you can really go in there and be creative and everything.","The script is so key to making a good movie. But everything is against you when you're making a movie: the logistics of putting a crew out where you need to go, whether the light is fading; if the weather's not right, something's wrong.","For me personally, when I was a kid, that's like the stuff I wanted to watch - all the R-rated stuff.","'Jurassic Park' is probably the movie that got me wanting to make movies. It's fun, but it's not totally gruesome.","My job is to kind of nudge them. Who said it, where, like, '90% of the job is casting,' so all I do is try to come to set and focus on getting all the best shots to cover the story; that's really it.","I always wanted to do a very fun, adventurous kind of car chase, and the opening of 'Ruin' is essentially like the 'Star Wars' trench run.","My background is in VFX, and I know from experience that the best VFX are when you have something real in the frame that you can either extend or work off of. It was really important to get as much as possible in camera, for real.","I have a few filmmaker friends who are known for shooting super-fast, and they say that you don't have the time to over-think things and how that helps things out creatively.","When you keep things responsible and manageable, you can make some interesting movies that you maybe couldn't make otherwise.","Movies are made in the scriptwriting process and prepping and preparations for the shooting process.","When you're out there trying to still figure things out, it can just slow things down. So you have to kind of think on your feet, and it makes it kind of fun and exciting and challenging at the same time. But more time is always better for any movie. I think any director would probably tell you that. Any filmmaker, really.","You know, things that might work in a book just do not work in the visual medium of movies.","Everything is always against you when making a movie, and if you don't have a solid blueprint that the entire team can get behind and understand and then execute, then you're going to be lost on the set.","I always knew the script was important, but I didn't realize how important until you get out there and just deal with the issues of putting a movie together. It's amazing that anything works, to be totally honest.","In a book, you can kind of take time and have lulls in places."],"Wes Bentley":["Everywhere you turn in New Zealand, there's something exciting to do. It's the gem of the world. It's so far away from the madness, and so you get that element. It was just stunning.","After 'Four Feathers,' I quit then because I just lost faith. I didn't like how the business was.","You treat characters like people you meet in life-friends or mentors.","My imagination was really hyperactive as a child and animated. I had those elements, but as you live and go through the hardships, it fades. 'Pete's Dragon' reawakened that. It rekindled the feeling of the invisible dragon.","Growing up, I could never decide what I wanted to be because I wanted to be so many things.","A reflection of an exact image is the closest thing to you-so that you can see it-but it's far enough away so that you really understand it. There is real life in this movie, but it hovers just an inch above reality.","Both my parents are Methodist preachers, I grew up in a church.","Then my extended family, there are preachers and evangelists, former priests. So I have quite a bit of history with Church, religion and spirituality.","I still consider myself a very spiritual person but the structure of the church isn't really for me.","I didn't know anything about Opus Die except from pop culture, like Dan Brown novels, which I knew wasn't really knowing anything about Opus Die.","But as a kid, I loved 'Monty Python.' My Dad was a devout watcher. We used to watch it when we ate dinner!","I wanted fame, but I thought it would be incremental, and I became afraid of the overnight-sensation thing.","I live to experience different things. Part of what I love about acting is to live the lives of others.","Whenever I am applying myself to something, I can't help but be part of it.","Sometimes when you're doing fantasy, that's the most important thing, is to be a blank space, because the last thing you want to do ever as an actor is judge yourself or the character or the movie that you're in. You want to just play the moment as best you can. Juilliard helped me do that.","I always think about stuff I learned, in any scene. Juilliard taught me a lot.","The first year at Juilliard is, I think, the best. And partly why I left - I only went one year. Partly why I felt okay leaving is that the most important elements, I believe, happen in the first year. What they do is they tear down all your conceptions of acting, and they take away all your tricks that you've learned.","I went in and read for 'Maleficent,' and it was hard to get a concept of what the imagery would be like. So you have a hard time seeing how you'll fit in to the movie through the visuals.","As an actor, you always want to reach back to being a child and having the spontaneity and the imagination of a child.","A lot of actors like to get themselves worked up, and I think from what I saw from Mr. Redford, he goes the other way. He relaxes into it.","Being in New Zealand, which is incredibly beautiful - I think it's paradise - it's just the perfect place. Everything about it I love, and I would love to live there.","A lot of actors will complain about the green screen work, but what you do get to do is what you probably should have learned, from the beginning, on stage. You have to create it in your mind and really go there to bring it. Part of the fun of acting is those challenges. You feel goofy, but sometimes that's a good feeling.","As far as the creative side, the more I do this, the more I know that it's all about the writing. We don't always celebrate that enough, but without the writing, you can't do much. You got on a film sometimes, and it's sort of half-written, and they expect and think that the actor's job is to bring the extra part and the good part. It's not.","It's all in the writing. The writing has got to be there. Whether that's dialogue or character, or whatever, it doesn't matter. As long as they've done something special, than you can do something special.","I am aware of my film habits because I have for so long played guys who are darker or dealing with very complex issues, and they're dealing with their darker sides.","I'd like to play a guy who doesn't think so much. I'd like a character whose words come out before he thinks about it. I want a character who is just kind of dumb in that way. A guy who doesn't have too many dangerous, devious ideas. It would be fun to play a role like that."],"Wes Borland":["There may be something good in silence. It's a brand new thing. You can hear the funniest little discussions, if you keep turning the volume down. Shut yourself up, and listen out loud.","Real family values have gone down the drain in modern families.","We're gonna totally sell out and try to dominate the world.","Guys are idiots, till they're what, 40 years old.","I could have probably gone on and still played the part of the guitar player of Limp Bizkit, but musically I was kind of bored. If I was to continue, it would have been about the money and not about the true music, and I don't want to lie to myself, or to them or to fans of Limp Bizkit.","I don't feel like singing should be taken lightly. It's one of the hardest things I've ever done, but it's coming along.","It's weird to try to write lyrics for somebody else. They can't really get behind what you're saying or what you want them to say because they didn't experience it.","Music has completely taken over every aspect of my life and ruined everything.","It took me a long time to find my voice as a singer, and I'm happy that I did.","I would love to put out music that was just stunning or soul-baring or whatever. But I don't think I have the voice for it.","I don't feel there's any kind of pain in my life.","I have nothing to complain about.","All I want to do is write songs about funny characters I made up.","I've never been in a band where someone goes, 'Ah, I've got the perfect name! And it's because I climbed Mount Fuji, and at the top a golden dove came down...' It's always a bunch of guys sitting around going, 'How about Rotten Chipmunks?'","I'm too old to be farting around with stuff that isn't precisely what I want to do.","I almost shouldn't be in Limp Bizkit; it's like I got matched in the factory with the wrong band.","I've accepted the fact that Limp Bizkit is my band, one that I'm a part of, a band that I've built from the beginning. It does me no good to be in somebody else's band playing their music, like Marilyn Manson or Korn. Being in Limp Bizkit allows me to be myself.","Selling records is fantastic. But if you're not loving what you do, and if everybody is throwing knives at you, it can get old very fast.","It's always a pleasure when you can compose guitar parts from a strong vocal and not just put the melody on top of guitar riffs.","Limp Bizkit is my main priority, but my side project, Black Light Burns, is still a labor of love. We have a record written, so we'll see when that comes out. When we tour, we go out in a van and trailer with me driving.","I'm always looking at other artists and trying to get inspired by different things.","I've never really been schooled in music theory. I'm a guitar player, and I attack the guitar in a certain way that it not fully unique to me, but it's more unique that some other people.","I've always wanted to be a songwriter and a storyteller and somebody who conveys a feeling to the listener or the viewer.","When playing any song in front of an audience, you're watching them experience it, and it changes. In a lot of ways, it's almost like the music is just the background buzz to what's happening between you and the audience in the room."],"Wes Boyd":["The Democratic Party had no idea how to use the Internet. They treated it like free money and then kept on doing all the rest of the things they normally do.","The party currently is about fund-raising and occasionally blasting out ads.","The party has to be much more. It has to connect in a real way with rank-and-file members and be their voice.","I actually think that one of the most dangerous phenomena is the bowing to expertise, whether it's in international relations or how to use technologies."],"Wes Brown":["I was taking electives, and that branched into theater. Theater led to me taking a break during the summer between my junior and senior year. After I graduated, I ended up moving out to L.A. But in my senior year, I made it a part of my major.","Shonda Rhimes is at the top of television.","When I got back from shooting 'Deception,' I was under contract with NBC, so I can't really do anything.","Love the show 'Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives.' Being from Louisiana and a big outdoorsman, I'm a big fan of 'Duck Dynasty' as well."],"Wes Craven":["Some people ask why people would go into a dark room to be scared. I say they are already scared, and they need to have that fear manipulated and massaged. I think of horror movies as the disturbed dreams of a society.","You learn a lot more from those bumps than from when things are going great.","Stories and narratives are one of the most powerful things in humanity. They're devices for dealing with the chaotic danger of existence.","Everybody is afraid of the unknown. Everybody is afraid of the people that they've done terrible things to!","If I'm going to be a caged bird, I'll sing the best song I can.","All I'm doing is rearranging the curtains in the insane asylum.","A lot of life is dealing with your curse, dealing with the cards you were given that aren't so nice. Does it make you into a monster, or can you temper it in some way, or accept it and go in some other direction?","It's not an easy place to be - to write a horror film. You go down the stairs to the dark to find these characters. It's not a place anyone can go, and sometimes it's not a place that you want to go.","I think the experience of going to a theater and seeing a movie with a lot of people is still part of the transformational power of the film, and it's equivalent to the old shaman telling a story by the campfire to a bunch of people.","How can you have 'Scream' without Ghostface? It's like 'Friday the 13th' without Jason.","You don't enter the theater and pay your money to be afraid. You enter the theater and pay your money to have the fears that are already in you when you go into a theater dealt with and put into a narrative.","The first monster you have to scare the audience with is yourself.","I never went to film school, so I never had the chance to be rejected.","All of us have our individual curses, something that we are uncomfortable with and something that we have to deal with, like me making horror films, perhaps.","My brother and I both used to worry about dying at 40 because our father died at 40. That probably wasn't terribly rational, since my father led a rather unhealthy lifestyle, shall we say.","That's what's great about the horror genre is that you're getting a load of people together in the cinema at the same place and the same time, having them all experience extreme fear and come out alive at the end. It's an uplifting experience, and there's a sense of elation.","I didn't even know what a horror film was. I kind of made it up as I went along.","Basically, I've found that if you have two films that don't perform well, it doesn't matter that you've had a bunch of successful ones. The phone stops ringing, and after 'Deadly Blessing' and 'Swamp Thing,' that's what happened.","I learned to take the first job that you have in the business that you want to get into. It doesn't matter what that job is, you get your foot in the door.","I have a lot of fans who are people of color. I think, if nothing else, I kind of understand that sense of being on the outside looking in, culturally.","I came from a very strict background.","I've done a few interviews where I realized that 9/11 was the ultimate home invasion, not to be glib about it. You know, where the place that you think is safe and the people that you think are safe and far from evil are suddenly just slaughtered by it, and you have no control over it.","Whenever I go to have a meeting at Universal, the security guard just leaps to his feet and comes over, bumps my hand, and says, 'Thank you! Thank you - I love your films!'","If something comes along that is totally outside of horror, fine, but I find there's an immense amount of freedom within the genre.","I think everybody goes off and does their own vision. And I don't take responsibility for other people's work, frankly. It's bad enough taking responsibility for my own.","I was anathema in polite society after I made 'Last House.' People literally would grab their children and run from the room.","I've experienced a great deal of, you know, ostracism from the making of films.","The thing of sitting in an audience and going into a dream-like state with several hundred other people that are sharing exactly what you're feeling is a profound event.","I didn't see many films until I was in college teaching.","The 'Scream' series is unique in that it's an ongoing murder mystery, even though it's a different killer, so if you know who that killer is, then half of the fun of the movie is gone.","I like to think I'm making films in the film business where movies are making enough numbers for the studios to let me keep working, but you also want those films to have content that makes you proud you made the film. That's not easy, but it's a fun puzzle to figure out.","When you do a film like 'My Soul to Take,' and people think it sucks, that hurts. We put a lot of work into it, and it's a good film, but you go on.","The whole business is changing dramatically, and the way fans follow and participate in movies, and make their own movies to emulate those movies, is profoundly different.","When you have a name that means scares, you have to live with that.","Everybody's making horror films and, to me, not especially well.","Within the structure of 'Scream 4,' there is the film within a film, but that's been part of the 'Scream' franchise since 'Scream 2,' when you had the 'Stab' franchise.","In 'Scream,' there is very real drama that would be in almost any drama.","In general, I don't even have the luxury of rehearsal time on most films that I make. It is just a scene-by-scene full cast read through. It's very much just doing the rehearsal sometimes the day before, at the end of the day, but just on the spot as the scene unfolds.","I had been a college teacher. I had taught Greek mythology.","You have to be aware of what the audience's expectations are, and then you have to pervert them, basically, and hit them upside the head from a direction they weren't looking.","I was paralyzed from the chest down when I was 19, so I kind of put my head together about dying, and I think I've come to terms with it.","In the '60s, I was teaching humanities at a college in upstate New York and trying to publish a novel I'd written in graduate school. But nothing was happening. So I moved to New York City and got a job as a messenger at a place that made movies.","A friend introduced me to Bob Shaye. He was one of the most remarkable men I've ever met. He was a Fulbright scholar, an excellent chef, and very knowledgeable about the arts.","I couldn't find an actor to play Freddy Krueger with the sense of ferocity I was seeking. Everyone was too quiet, too compassionate towards children. Then Robert Englund auditioned.","My mother never saw any of my films until she was in her late 80s, and that was 'Music of the Heart' with Meryl Streep.","There was a period around Columbine when horror films were being kind of assailed by the government. The studios got very afraid that they were going to be sued, and studios at about that time were all being taken over by corporations.","I think I wrote the first draft of 'Nightmare on Elm Street' in '79. No one wanted to buy it. Nobody. I felt very strongly about it, so I stayed with it and kept paying my assistant and everything. At a certain point, I was literally flat broke.","I come from a blue-collar family, and I'm just glad for the work.","I can see that I give my audience something. I can see it in their eyes, and they say 'Thank you' a lot. You realize you are doing something that means something to people.","I had a musician friend once tell me that it's not in the orchestra that you get the true test of the musicians but in the little trios and quintets where you really get to see if they've got the stuff. And the composer.","I'm the kind of director, at any given moment, an idea occurs to me, I'll just do it.","A businessman can be as military as any politician.","A big part of directing is being strong in certain circumstances and taking the gamble and hope you don't get fired.","I went to a Christian college. You would be expelled if you were caught in a movie theater. It was ridiculous.","My goal is to die in my 90s on the set, say, 'That's a wrap,' after the last shot, fall over dead, and have the grips go out and raise a beer to me.","You want to give the person as much freedom as you can within the boundaries of being a responsible producer with a contract to a studio. It's about giving as much freedom as you can, and the more the filmmaker proves he or she is on the track that you feel good about, then you just kind of watch dailies.","My whole background was in voracious book-reading.","My mother wouldn't even let me read DC Comics. I came from a very strict background.","'Last House' offended a lot of people. The results in the theaters, even in Boston, reminded me a bit of things from when I was studying Theater of the Absurd, and the rise and the appearance of Ionesco plays, and things like that.","I don't know, I always had an active dream life, and there's something so profound and wonderful about a movie. It's so alive. It's so shared. The thing of sitting in an audience and going into a dream-like state with several hundred other people that are sharing exactly what you're feeling is a profound event.","I did many things in my life - I painted, and I'd play guitar, and wrote and did many things. But it all seemed to come together in making movies, and almost accidentally.","I think being Jewish has been covered really well but almost nothing about being fundamentalist Protestant. For years, I've had a movie in my mind called 'Total Immersion' that looks to my life as a kid where you're immersed in this different worldview from almost everybody around you.","In high school, we would give away rulers to our friends that said, 'Jesus loves you.' I couldn't put together the concept that Jesus loves you, but if you don't love him back, you'll burn in hell forever. I worried, 'I'm rejecting the Holy Spirit, so I'm definitely going to burn in hell.'","I remember going to a funeral at a very fundamentalist church, and I just had to get out of there. I went out in the parking lot and just sobbed. I think there was a sense of loss of that little boy not knowing if he was right or wrong. Everything I grew up with I had to walk away from.","'To Kill a Mockingbird' was so important because it was such adult film-making - to see something that dealt with such an important issue and had such an enlightened outlook on the world.","You just find the best actors that you can. There's an inherent drama within the framework of scares and killings and all that. In 'Scream,' there is very real drama that would be in almost any drama.","I was always told that films were evil and such, but I started to realise what a load of crap it was that something this good should be forbidden. I had been allowed to read as much as I wanted when I was younger, so I recognised great art when I saw it; I just didn't realise it would be at the cinema as well.","Hawks is great, 'The Treasure of Sierra Madre,' 'The Big Sleep'... He could do the Salt-of-the-Earth very well. He was a very smooth director; a very good film architect in terms of his storytelling.","Looking back now, if I went to film school, it probably would have helped knowing what the best of the best of foreign films were, but that wasn't the case. In some ways, I think that led to my originality, because I hadn't seen anybody else.","There will always be times where you think, 'What went wrong? Why wasn't that one more popular?' You can't always figure that out, especially if you think you've done the best job you can do and was interesting to you. I mean, 'My Soul to Take,' I thought should have done much better, and I still like that film a lot.","Great horror films don't win Academy Awards.","A friend, Sean Cunningham, who went on to do 'Friday the 13th,' was given a small budget to produce a scary movie, and he told me to write something. I'd never seen a horror film in my life; I'd fallen in love with Fellini.","'Nightmare on Elm Street' wasn't that big. Over a long period of time it did very well, but this was different. 'Scream' didn't have a strong first weekend, and it went down the second, but then it kept going up.","At this point in my career, 'Scream' is one of the longest running stories I've told. It's fascinating to still have actors who are very much into continuing their roles and have great chemistry.","It's great to be thought of as the master of anything. Even idiocy. Master of idiocy, Wes Craven. But if it's master of horror or fear or whatever, that's great."],"Wes Montgomery":["A lot of places we go, when they see the organ coming in, they're expecting rock and roll, but after they hear us play they like it. To me, guitar cuts through-it carries more than organ. But organ has got more guts.","I've really gone into business since I got the 6 string, which was like starting all over.","Well, I got pretty good and went on the road with a group. We starved. At that time I didn't realize that you'd work one gig in Kansas City, the next in Florida and the next gig will be in Louisville. You know, a thousand miles a night. That was really rough, man."],"Wes Studi":["Irony is one of my favorite aspects of life.","I'm Cherokee, and there were times when social expansion was something that is needed by a cultural group or a national group.","I like to be able to raise people's consciousness, yes. And to remind that those of us involved in the receiving end of the oppression, we have a duty."],"Wes Welker":["To tell you the truth, I thought I would be returning kicks and punts my whole career. I thought that was going to be my deal, and I was fine with that.","I think the older you get, the more you realize how important life is, the more you think about your family.","I grew up playing soccer and always loved playing it.","I can't say Boston is 'home-home.' It's definitely a place I'm growing accustomed to. It's such a great sports town.","Just because I'm undersized and under-this and under-that, I've still been a good football player since I was little.","You always think you're one of those players who will be in one place the whole time, one of those guys they'll never let leave because you play hurt, do what it takes. But it's a different age. A lot of coaches, they like having younger guys.","When I'm answering questions from the Denver media, I'm not worried about what the Broncos' people are going to think. I'm worried about what Belichick will think. Isn't that crazy?","When I first came into the league, I was with Tim Dwight in San Diego, and a guy named Eric Parker, who really showed me the work ethic it takes to be an NFL receiver, and I've really tried to keep that with me.","I go out there with whatever the coaches call, and whatever they do, I just go out there, and I'm the player. Coaches coach, and players play.","I take really good care of myself, and I make sure that my body's in tip-top condition, and I stay on top of everything - eat right and do everything else to make sure that I can play for a long time.","Basically, I really like to train. That's what keeps me busy during the offseason - just training and getting my body right and getting ready for the next year."],"Wesley Clark":["I remember in the spring of 1971, a hundred thousand people converged on the Pentagon in June of 1971. They threw blood; I guess it was goat's blood or something, on the steps to the Pentagon. People were being accused of being murderers and baby killers. You just can't imagine the civic outrage.","For the United States to be a global leader, we have to have a very tight relationship with Europe. And we've held that relationship since 1949 when we established the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, NATO. NATO is the bond. It's a security bond.","Next to upholding the Constitution of the United States, the president's highest duty is to protect the security of this country - our national security.","The truth is, about the Middle East is, had there been no oil there, it would be like Africa. Nobody is threatening to intervene in Africa.","The American public should simply accept no distractions. In our democracy, it is our duty to hold our elected leaders accountable. We do it at the ballot box.","What I learned in the military is that gossip starts early and it stays forever.","What I did warn about when I testified in front of Congress in 2002, I said if you want to worry about a state, it shouldn't be Iraq, it should be Iran. But this government, our administration, wanted to worry about Iraq, not Iran.","George W. Bush has helped those who have most, hurt those who have least and ignored everyone in between.","As president of the United States, my top priority will be to keep America safe. We're going to go after the terrorist networks. We're going to go after Osama bin Laden. We are not going to live in fear in this country.","I think we're at risk with our democracy. I think we're dealing with the most closed, imperialistic, nastiest administration in living memory. They even put Richard Nixon to shame.","Europe and America must act together in the face of evil. It's high time for Americans and Europeans to restore that unity and be able to take actions collectively together.","Veterans have had a long record of leaning towards the Republican Party. I think that's changing. I think that President Obama has the strongest record with veterans among any president in my lifetime.","Everybody in the military has a reputation, and usually it doesn't come out to the public.","You have to be true to what you believe in and do your duty.","I like Hilary Clinton. I think she's - she's a fantastic leader.","Russia and China, when they were communist-like adversaries, they didn't participate. They're participating now in the world with us. They're trading monetary instruments. We're buying and selling goods back and forth, trading oil and so forth.","Turkey's a NATO member. If Turkey gets attacked, we have to help defend Turkey.","The Ukrainians don't have the military means to stand up to Russia, but we haven't helped them militarily, either.","In the 1950s, Pakistan allied with the United States in something called the Central Treaty Organization. We were lined up with, at that time, Iran, ruled by the Shah, and Pakistan and Turkey as a southward shield against Soviet expansion toward the warm waters of the Indian Ocean and the Persian Gulf. It was part of the containment strategy.","China invaded India, and there was a war between India and China in some of the disputed terrain in 1962, and India got hurt by that.","I worked for the troops my entire time in the United States Armed Forces because we know in the United States Armed Forces that it's not the generals and the colonels that win battles, it's the soldiers: it's the people at the front, the mechanics with their wrenches, the drivers moving the logistics back in the rear.","When Bill Clinton ran in '92, and I listened to him, and I had of course known of his record from Arkansas, I found him extraordinarily inspirational, and I voted Democratic.","When we started after Osama bin Laden, we really decided to go after the Taliban. And we seemed to be content to kick the Taliban out of Kandahar. And then we let Osama bin Laden escape from Tora Bora.","Ukraine is a big country. It is 45-46 million people. It has got a lot of modern industry; it also has a lot of very key resources. There is no reason for it not to be one of the leading countries of Europe.","The purpose of the European Union expansion is to bring stability to the East, and ultimately, that stability will come to Russia. There is no long term reason that Russia can't be part of the same peaceful community of nations.","One of the things I learned in the military is sometimes you don't know what mistakes you make for a long time. But as you go through a campaign, there's lots of decision points you make, and you don't know whether those are gonna be the right decision points or not.","I always said I would vote for a resolution that gave the president the leverage to go to the United Nations, and then come back to the Congress for the authority to go to force.","People make mistakes. And one of the mistakes that the United States consistently made was that it could intervene and somehow adjust people's governments, especially in the Middle East.","My mother told me once that she and my father agreed that I would not be brought up Jewish in Chicago. She had me going to a Methodist church.","Once I started first grade, I started going to Emmanuel Baptist Church regularly. I went to Sunday school. We had Bible readings and things like that.","Gert was always of the mind that she wouldn't go to another church except the Catholic Church. So when I would date her in New York City, and later when we went to Oxford before we got married, we always went to the Catholic church.","I said the rosary, and I said the Our Father, as they call it in the Catholic Church. One of the things I learned in the conversion process was to say the rosary, and I had a set of rosary beads. So I said 'Hail Mary, full of grace.'","In my experience, in bringing coercive diplomacy to bear against Slobodan Milosevic, no bomb strike was more important than maintaining NATO's cohesion.","A commander in chief with military experience might be able to prod a conservative military into thinking more imaginatively.","Slobodan Milosevic was just as smart as a five-year-old. Five-year-olds have an uncanny way of getting into your psyche, your self-esteem.","Our men and women fighting in Iraq are held accountable for their performance and their conduct. On duty and off, twenty-four hours a day. They're fighting for us, for our safety, our rights, and our freedoms."],"Wesley Morris":["'The Tree of Life' is a collection of conversations that lost souls and true believers have with themselves while keeping their heads to the sky. But the movie is church via the planetarium.","The bravery of Stanley Kramer's 'Guess Who's Coming to Dinner' amounted to two Hollywood legends - Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy - telling the world that a black son-in-law is something they can live with, and so should you, especially if he looks like Sidney Poitier and has degrees.","Poor decisions and bad luck are contingencies of most horror films.","'Polisse' is the sort of cop thriller where people do things like angrily bang on a desktop or sweep everything off it. If it happens once, it must happen six times. But every time it did, I wanted to stand up and cheer, which I've never wanted to do for any such thriller.","'The Dictator' lands somewhere between wan Mel Brooks and good Adam Sandler, whose 'You Don't Mess With the Zohan,' about an Israeli Special Forces soldier at a hair salon, manages to strike better contrasts with vaguely similar culture differences - it's a nuttier movie, too.","In movies, there are some things the French do that Americans are increasingly incapable of doing. One is honoring the complexities of youth. It's a quiet, difficult undertaking, requiring subtlety in a filmmaker and perception and patience from us.","Movies are visual, aural, they involve people, and life, and ideas and art, they are so elastic. They can hold anything, withstand everything, and make you feel anything. Other arts can do that, but movies are the only ones that can incorporate other media into cinema.","Anyone who watches a lot of television, or listens to pop music, is familiar with a certain vision of America. If not exactly colorblind, this America is one in which different races easily interact, in which a white person might have an Asian boss, Hispanic stepson, or African-American frenemy.","Sidney Poitier became a star in part by helping black and white Americans negotiate their new relationship in the post-Civil Rights era.","The enormous success of 2009's 'The Blind Side,' in which Sandra Bullock makes a black teenager one of the family, demonstrates that America isn't post-racial. It is thoroughly mired in race - the myths that surround it, the guilt it inspires, the discomfort it causes, the struggle to transcend it.","Sometimes a movie knows you're watching it. It knows how to hold and keep you, how, when it's over, to make you want it all over again.","Computers are scary. They're nightmares to fix, lose our stuff, and, on occasion, they crash, producing the blue screen of death. Steve Jobs knew this. He knew that computers were bulky and hernia-inducing and Darth Vader black. He understood the value of declarative design.","Most Pixar films are better than most live action films.","In the Mac vs. PC ads, Apple bills itself as the antidote to Microsoft. To love Apple wasn't to sell out. It was to buy in. Most people use PCs, but Apple has the mindshare.","Standing beneath the white light of an Apple store is like standing on a Stanley Kubrick movie set. His '2001: A Space Odyssey' predicted Jobs and a future where technology was our friend. Kubrick, of course, didn't like what he saw. And occasionally, I have my doubts.","Sidney Lumet's chief preoccupation wasn't art. It was right and wrong in the American city, nearly always in New York.","Robert Pattinson has the face of a film-noir dupe. It's a face that is searching and open and kind. It's a face that a certain type of woman might want to fool because, in its intensely old-fashioned kindness, the face says, I love you. Fool me.","There comes a point in your moviegoing life where you look at the screen and then you look at the world and you ask, 'What is going on?' You want the movies to show you the chaos and mess and risk and failure that are normal for a lot of us. Generally, the movies hide all of that.","No, I don't know why Bobby and Peter Farrelly bothered with a 'Three Stooges' movie, either. But if they're anything like some men I know, their love for Moe, Larry, and Curly (and an assortment of fourth bananas) is deep, abiding, and unembarrassable. In other words: How could the Farrellys not?","My father didn't do a lot of direct education. My mother was the direct educator. She would put on these movies on American Movie Classics when we got cable, after my parents got divorced, which took like four or five years.","I feel like I've always approached criticism with a degree of morality, right? Like, not as a moralizer, but just as somebody who wants to make sure that the culture we're getting is at least morally aware of how it's functioning.","The difference between me and, say, the opera critic is that I'm charged with thinking about the world beyond opera. I could go see 'Die Fledermaus', for instance. I've never done any of this, by the way. I've never written about one opera since I've had this job.","I don't see a lot, but I think what the movie studios know and what they always know but they kind of ignore, which is that a there's an audience for movies like 'Get Out,' and 'Hidden Figures,' and to some extent 'Moonlight,' which made a lot less money than 'Hidden Figures' did.","If Judge Steven T. O'Neill sent Mr. Cosby away for the rest of his life, that sentence couldn't undo what he's convicted of having done to Andrea Constand, his accuser in two trials. It also can't undo what he once did for me, which was to make me believe in myself.","'America's Dad' is what we called Bill Cosby. And we called him that because, well, what a revolutionary way to put it. Through him, we were thumbing our noses at the long, dreary history for black men in America by elevating this one to a paternal Olympus. In the 1980s, he made the black American family seem 'just like us.'","The Huxtables laughed and bonded and debated and lip-synced. They were glamorous and simple and extraordinarily human. And affluent. And educated. And so many different kinds of black. You'd think that all of that would make them the Howard University of African-American family life. But white people wanted to matriculate, too.","I couldn't have known how vertiginous the entire Huxtable project was. I was, like, 10, 13, 15 years old when the show was a thing. But eventually, I could see that Cliff became a play for respectability. 'This is how you comport yourself among white people, young black child. Take a little bit of Howard with you on your way to Harvard.'","Nudity has never seemed to bother Grace Jones. Her art has thrived, in part, on a physical candor that both shocked people and redrew the boundaries of taste, beauty, and eroticism around her masculinity, ebony skin, and unrelenting intensity.","'Bloodlight and Bami' delivers. Ms. Jones shucks her own oysters - stressfully. She does her own make up and performs her own vexed yet amusing contract negotiations.","'Bloodlight and Bami' is all verite. The director Sophie Fiennes began filming Ms. Jones in the mid-2000s and simply observes her on stage and off. She follows her home to Jamaica, where the diva mellows, almost unconsciously, into a daughter, sister, and parishioner.","The relief of 'Grace Jones: Bloodlight and Bami' is that it seeks to square the person with the provocateuse.","This country is rich with awful things to say about everybody. There's a slur for you and a slur for me - more than one. And because we're terrified of dealing with them head on, we've made them just as easy to warp and defang.","'Savage' is a trait that might get you into business school or retweeted 10,000 times. It's what a kid might say after somebody does something awesome or gnarly or fierce: 'Oh, that's savage!' It's the skate park. It's the high-school cafeteria. It's the YouTube comments section.","American popular culture has long been marked by an absence of empathy for American Indians. Westerns doubled as a campaign against so-called savages in a way that desensitized us to the savages we'd become.","When a black person is acting up or showing off, somebody might say she's 'wilin' out.' In sports, an athlete who really takes it to another level has entered 'beast mode,' which happens to be the nickname of the former Seattle Seahawks superstar Marshawn Lynch.","Movies and television have a way of using a soundtrack not just to create a mood but to literalize it. You could always count on a master class in splitting the difference between artistry and obviousness during the so-called Blaxploitation era.","The reason to do any barking - well, the reason for me - is that 'Three Billboards' feels so off about so many things. It's one of those movies that really do think they're saying something profound about human nature and injustice.","'In Bruges' featured two hit men on a chatty stroll in Belgium, and certain people's passion for it is fit for Valentine's Day. But it was Tupperware Tarantino to me.","My favorite bad thing about 'Three Billboards' is its ambition to play around with America's ideological and geographical toys.","'Three Billboards,' which is not based on a true story but does have some reality flavoring, must appear worthy of elected office in some way. This was, at first, the illusion presented by the people running the campaigns and, in turn, over the years, has become the custom for lots of us.","I like Rob Morgan in 'Mudbound.' Most of the attention being paid to this movie has focused on Rachel Morrison's cinematography and Mary J. Blige's stiff but intensely stoical performance.","'Lady Bird' probably doesn't need more attention than it has gotten. It's a perfect movie, and some of its perfection is in its casting, but this is a movie crammed with wonderful work by people who aren't Laurie Metcalf and Saoirse Ronan: people like Lucas Hedges, Tracy Letts, Stephen McKinley Henderson, and, yes, that Timothee Chalamet.","Lesley Manville comes at 'funny' from a totally different direction in 'Phantom Thread,' using snootiness and froideur. The effect of her performance - as the difficult manager of her difficult brother's couture dress business - stems in part from the chill she puts into her line readings.","What about Hong Chau? In typical supporting-part fashion, she shows up halfway through 'Downsizing,' already shrunk, an imperious Vietnamese house cleaner with a limp and sharp angles. The movie's satirical cleverness upstages its rage; then Ms. Chau proves she's capable of managing both.","Every once in a while with Twitter, you find something that breaks through the bilge and recrimination. Or sometimes, something finds you. One night, 'The Mechanics of History' found me.","There is a tragic kind of joke. You really can't keep a man down - good but often otherwise - because history's mechanics are built to keep him climbing toward the top. Somehow, Icarus gets to be reborn as Iron Man.","Part of what's mesmerizing about 'The Mechanics of History' is its physical eloquence - how dancerly it is. The men don't fall; they float. And when the trampoline restores them to the staircase, they move at a half speed. Cinema, they say, is 24 frames per second.","In 'The One Who Falls,' three women and three men, in everyday clothes, negotiate each other while moving, often in unison, on a giant spinning tile.","Jordan Peele is famous, in part, for imitations - of rappers and dingbats and the 44th president of the United States. But he would be impossible to imitate. He isn't ribald. He's droll. Sometimes he's not even that. Sometimes he's quiet. Sometimes he's sitting across from you expecting you to hold up your end of a conversation.","'Get Out,' of course, is the surprise hit movie that Peele wrote and directed about a black man named Chris, who discovers that his white girlfriend's family is running a nasty racist conspiracy.","Racism is old, but Peele found a poetic new way of talking about it. He gave us language we didn't know we lacked.","Sunken-place entrants include Clarence Thomas, Ben Carson, Tiger Woods, O.J. Simpson, sometimes Kanye West, and any black person with something nice to say about President Trump. It's more generous than 'sellout' and less punitive than 'Uncle Tom,' a dis and a road to redemption.","One result of moviemaking - and a side effect of moviegoing - is familiarity. If an actor is particularly good, familiarity opens into something deeper: care, concern, identification, empathy. Yet even those concepts can feel inadequate for some actors.","Ms. Sciorra is a member of a dwindling fleet of actors who actually sound like they come from somewhere. In her case, 'somewhere' is Brooklyn. In most movies, and perhaps especially in a handful of singeing 'Sopranos' episodes, 'somewhere' makes her vital. She's what you'd call an around-the-way girl.","Suddenly, stories of abuse and harassment are being believed; abusers and harassers are being toppled. Yet, at the same time, one of the top movies in the country right now is 'Daddy's Home 2,' which has a biggish, comedic part for Mel Gibson. He's the man whose anti-Semitism and racist rants became part of the cultural lore.","I don't like turkey. I mean, I do. But I don't like it on Thanksgiving. I don't need it. There are about 20 other dishes that get put on a table or a counter or that stay warming on the stove that I'd rather eat than turkey.","A week before Thanksgiving, my mother bought the turkey, frozen. Then she froze it some more. Then she let it thaw and cleaned it - and I mean really cleaned it, because nobody wanted a 'dirty bird.' She salt-and-peppered the turkey, buttered, paprika-ed, and nominally stuffed it.","My mother very rarely skipped a Thanksgiving turkey. And yet, none of them ever tasted quite the same, landing somewhere on a sliding scale of succulence. She'd try new methods.","We don't yet call it 'Thxgvng,' because any holiday whose centerpiece sits in an oven for four to six hours, after having sat out for as long to reach room temperature, must be spelled all the way out. Cook a turkey. You'll see. This is to say that you're not just roasting a turkey, obviously.","Spare a thought for 'Suburbicon' as it swiftly vanishes from America's megaplexes. This is George Clooney's movie about - well, I'm not sure. It's supposed to be the sort of movie that doesn't get made much anymore: starry, not that expensive, 'middlebrow.'","'Suburbicon' feels like a last gasp of some kind of middle. It thinks it's both frivolous and serious. But, for that, you need a touch that George Clooney's never had.","Anytime a movie or television show retreats into certain American pasts, I'm both annoyed and relieved.","Mr. Clooney has directed six movies; five are set in the middle of the previous century. And 'Suburbicon' clarifies why. Race is a blind spot.","'Playboy' operated with a patina of civility that granted the average man a presumption of pleasure that went one way - his. And that permission flourished in the psyches of all kinds of men.","When Oliver Stone and Woody Allen came forward to express sympathy for Mr. Weinstein, everybody rolled their eyes at them, too.","You didn't have to read 'Playboy,' visit the mansion, wear pajamas, or even be straight: The effects of its ideas about women on the American psyche were totalizing. Women were inferior to men because, for 'Playboy,' they were scenery - pretty, passive, usually white, often blonde, there.","There's power in turning to the past to illuminate the current state of things."],"Wesley Ruggles":["A figure with curves always offers a lot of interesting angles.","One figure can sometimes add up to a lot."],"Wesley Schultz":["When I was a kid, award shows were super-interesting for me. But when I started making music, it was kind of hard to watch because I believed in what I was doing and yet knew I didn't really have a shot.","But the Grammys is just not something I can take too seriously. It would be a mistake to hinge my happiness on something so completely out of my control.","The basic idea is always constructed around piano or guitar and a voice, that's what we live and die by, because if you build up from that foundation, it's going to be strong.","I thought music could take you to a place where you didn't even feel ownership of it, you just felt lucky you were there. It's like church without God, or something. It's about feeling, hope and catharsis and things that are nurturing.","I've always had service-industry jobs, because those were the easiest to quit or take time off from.","I think the death knell for any musician is getting a job that you like and pays enough that you just stay there forever.","There are a lot of obligations when you put out a record and it does well. People want to talk to you, which is nice. So then you make sure you do that.","I was born in New Jersey, but it doesn't sound like I'm from a certain region."],"Wesley Snipes":["I don't see myself as extremely handsome. I just figure I can charm you into liking me.","I think of myself as a young prince from a long line of royalty.","Nobody wants to get locked up, although 'locked up' is a matter of perspective. There can be people who are out who are in prison mentally and emotionally and worse off than those who are behind bars.","I like science fiction and physics, things like that. Planets being sucked into black holes, and the various vortexes that create possibility, and what happens on the other side of the black hole. To me it's the microcosmic study of the macrocosmic universe in man, and that's why I'm attracted to it.","So don't send me up the river yet.","I have a whole other side that has yet to be seen on screen.","My sign is Leo. A Leo has to walk with pride. When he takes a step, he has to put his foot down. You walk into a room and you want people to know your presence, without you doing anything.","I think that all of us, as Americans, are due due process and have a right to a fair trial, and have a right to be considered innocent until proven guilty. I think that is the American way and it's the foundation upon which this country was built.","We're conditioned in this country to believe that if there's a problem, the black man is usually the culprit.","I've reduced a lot of the stress in my life. I've gotten rid of a lot of things. The light was turned on and a lot of the cockroaches started spinning. I swept them out the door. And sometimes you just have to throw things out because they carry a certain energy.","I think I have kind of a natural magnetism.","I used to do puppet theatre and also mime and musical theatre in Florida for competitions and festivals, which was great. I was very much involved in theatre when I was in college.","I had acne late, in college. My skin used to be really flawless. Went to college, became a vegetarian, ate a lot of cheese - big mistake. Here I am trying to be healthy and I'm eating grilled cheese sandwiches and french fries every day, having mad eruptions all over my face.","I've come to the conclusion that beautiful women in the West aren't comfortable finding strength in their femininity. They want to do masculine-oriented things to establish their femininity. It's a contradiction.","I was never charged with tax evasion. I've never been a tax protester.","I never really planned on making action films. It just kind of happened.","I grew up in the Bronx. The Bronx teaches you to survive. It's like, 'Bring it on!'","I'm proud to be an American. I'm proud to be an African American in America. I've had some interesting experiences: some great, some not so great, but I love it here.","I mainly buy books in my free time.","Lot of the scripts I've been in with other non-white actors haven't been great. Lot of non-white actors ain't all that great.","Certain roles are more challenging than others, but I haven't come across one yet that I can't tackle.","I didn't defraud the government by taking money that was not mine.","I come out of repertory theatre so I've been working under pressure my whole career.","My mother was pretty much on my case all the time.","There is a bit of arrogance with 'Hollywood' types that doesn't sit well with game developers.","Personally I find there is just as much if not more creativity among game makers as there is among feature filmmakers.","I've been trying to keep the private life private. Not being savvy or trained on how to do good interviews like a politician, I thought it was wiser to follow my mother's advice: If you have nothing good to say, don't say anything at all.","There are so few guys who do action and do it well. Even fewer who are African-American. Even fewer who have classical-theater training. So a cat like me coming in, I'm bringing all of that to an action movie.","Internationally, I have as large of a fan base - if not larger - than I have domestically.","I think any man would be nervous if his liberty is at stake.","I've been a law-abiding citizen ever since I grew up in the Bronx, New York.","I have some cops in my family. I understand the predicament that they're in. Sometimes they go into it just to pay the bills or because they don't have other choices, or sometimes they just want to get the gun.","I didn't go into this business to do action because I'm a classically trained actor. But I'm good at kicking and punching.","No one can train you to be famous. How do you deal with the loss of anonymity, the loss of privacy? You have to be disciplined.","I've always been paying my taxes and I've always been trying to comply.","We should be able to go to our government and get clear answers.","The first time I jumped from a plane, I screamed like a woman. I was two miles up and you could hear me clear as day. Now I love it.","If a woman decides she likes me, it would behoove her to take into consideration that my art has had a strong influence on the type of person I am.","I was very short when I was little, so I probably had - and there may be a residue of it now - that Napoleon complex. Wanting to be as big and as powerful as the big guys.","A lot of people now don't know I've been on Broadway.","I like to read about different religions - Judaism, Islam, Christianity, Hinduism and Buddhism.","I love being a dad, it keeps me fit and inspired and children are so funny. They always supply you with acting material!","I was convicted of three misdemeanors of willful failure to file a form.","Well, I'm an artist to the core. And my objective has always been to use my talents and my skills to elevate humanity through my art.","I had faith in the concept and the theory that all Americans are endowed with the right to a fair trial and I would be fairly judged and fairly tried.","I'm a good mimic.","A lot of the cats I grew up with in the South Bronx found themselves in sticky situations.","I'm a physical type of actor and love projects in which I can get physical. The more action, the better.","I'm not looking at an action movie as something where I just jump around and look beautiful and show my muscles. Since there are so few people that do this and have that pedigree, people disregard their contribution."],"Wesley Willis":["Schizophrenia demons live in my head.","Quit shouting those rerun songs at me.","I'm not gonna be warded off the joy music bus."],"Westbrook Pegler":["I am a member of the rabble in good standing.","Golf is the most useless outdoor game ever devised to waste the time and try the spirit of man.","My hates have always occupied my mind much more actively and have given greater spiritual satisfactions than my friendships."],"Whit Stillman":["There's the right person, or right people, for each other. There is that order that's searching to be found but, I think, it's not as if everything is going to be automatic. So, people could really be meant for each other and its goes awry; or they could have to learn or develop and grow up together. Grow to be right together.","I think my favorite two words are 'true blue.' I think those words are really important, and the spirit of them has been lost.","The worst thing is the blank page at the start. Then the horrible things written on the blank page. Then deciding whether or not to throw out those horrible things: lame scenes, lame characters, bad ideas.","I'm a late bloomer. Even in high school, everyone else was charging ahead, and I didn't come into my own until very late. I feel that's true in cinema, too. I didn't even start 'Metropolitan' until I was 37.","Paris is the destination for brokenhearted American women. I think men go there and have their hearts broken, but women come there with their hearts broken.","Sometimes, people who are very fastidious about what they're going to do in their work are not very fastidious in their private life. I'm like that. I love it when people do really nice things around me, but I don't have time to do it for myself. It's very hard for me to even buy a new pair of trousers.","I have to embrace the fact people find me divisive, but I find it remarkable. I was very disturbed by the hatred 'Damsels in Distress' received.","I think when my parents were together, my family was too prosperous for our psychological health. Not that they were that rich, but I feel that usually inherited wealth causes psychological problems.","I'm anti-verite. I think the verite style is a completely false thing. Most things are false to arrive at a truth; verite is falsity without acknowledging its falsity.","I've learned that I really want to shoot short films on a short schedule. There can be very good films that run 110 minutes, but 90 minutes is beautiful.","The 'Damsels' crew was low-budget, young people who were doing their first thing almost. A lot of it. It felt like Pied Piper or Rumpelstiltskin or whatever: it was me and people thirty years younger or more. But it was great; it was really fun.","A lot of people in the film industry are fatalists who think a worthwhile film will always achieve its destiny, and the films that aren't worthwhile won't. It's all sort of pre-determined, etc. And I don't think that's true at all.","So much of selling a film in the industry is about creating a fulcrum where all the pressure comes to bear, and something seems suddenly valuable and approved by an audience. It's amazing how people could pick up tons of films on the cheap, but they don't because they wait until everything is laid out for them.","Oddly, in a sense, I still have more confidence as a director than my ability as a writer. Somehow, directing is just really easy. It's just about being really honest about how you feel about what you're seeing.","One of the downsides of money is if there's no money, there are very few real jerks who are attached to your project. And if there is money, you do attract some very difficult, unhelpful people.","Coming out of university, one of my obsessions was that in the novels I was reading, they seemed to be portraying a world that had a social fabric. People knew each other in 'War and Peace.' They went to all the same balls. These were societies with tightly wound, woven, social textures.","I don't think there's anything cliche feminine about Jane Austen. And, anyway, her earliest champions were Sir Walter Scott and the Prince Regent.","When you're doing the work, film and TV are exactly the same. TV is just film in reduced pieces.","Making a show is such a long process. You go through a TV production house that will commission scripts, and if they like what you've written, they take it to a network and sell it to them. It has always felt very far away from something that's actually real.","My biggest false steps have actually been when I tried to do very different projects. I found I was getting people saying, 'Why does Whit Stillman think he can do a film about blacks in early '60s Jamaica? Or the Chinese and the cultural revolution?' Those were the two biggest failures I had getting off the ground.","The usual key to getting films made seems to be a producer's terrier-like determination not to let it go. Unfortunately, such producers often seem prone to sinking their claws into mediocre projects.","The dull externals of the screenwriter's working life are well known: We are the people taking up too much table space at cafes.","Paris is a Roach Motel for top American journalists: They check in, having won the plum foreign posting, but never leave.","Happy is the small business that can hire additional employees besides the proprietor; rare is the indie-film enterprise that can be happy in this way. The norm is an unpaid principal with no employees between productions.","What I like and find liberating in dialogue comedy is that the characters, and what they say, are not me. These are fleeting thoughts and observations and not presented as truths but as something that illuminates the character and the dynamic between the characters. This kind of dialogue is thesis and antithesis - and we never get to a synthesis.","In Mexico, wealth and poverty live next to each other and are cordial with each other - in my experience.","I didn't realize how limiting an R rating is. I made 'Disco' as a cautionary tale for 14- and 15-year-old girls, and those girls were not allowed to see the film by their parents.","I'm not sure what my material would have been if I'd have started earlier. I probably would have started with 'Damsels in Distress' kinds of films because that's the kind of comedy I was writing in college. So I didn't really have any life experience to work off of.","I read one Jane Austen in college and didn't like it at all and told everyone how much I disliked it. I read 'Northanger Abbey' sophomore year in college and hated it. I didn't read good Austen until after college, maybe a couple years out.","I learned that you have to say that you're a filmmaker. You're not a screenwriter; you're not a director for hire. You've got to take charge. You're a filmmaker, and you're going to make a film.","You have to constantly work on your script if it needs it. You don't accept, 'Oh, I did a draft and...' No, it's your responsibility to work on the script as much as possible and make it better and better.","I remember when I was trying to do 'Metropolitan,' in breaks I would read a page of two of Jane Austen as a palate-cleanser.","Coming out of college, back to New York, where I didn't really know that many people, I thought our world was very atomized.","If you're sort of interested in politics but sort of upset about contemporary politics, it's kind of wonderful to read about periods who were very eloquent and admirable - generally. People are articulating ideas you can sympathize with or understand both sides of. Or at least feel like one side is saying the right things.","I can fake decent penmanship, but generally, it's really just terrible. And, unfortunately for me, maybe fortunately for the reader, it's very often illegible. If I get an idea, and if I do remember to write it down, which is rare, I write in such a way that I can't read a letter.","There's so much of this thing now, where you're supposed to do all the work before you get the commission. I think it's really good to try to resist that. If you just have a week to come up with a pitch for something, your ideas aren't going to be very good. Get your income from somewhere else, and keep your writing not tied into these contracts.","That's why I hate the outlines and treatments, because all you get are cliches. If you put things down on paper as your plan, it's very hard to get those ideas out of your head and do something better.","I had, in college, a professor called Walter Jackson Bate, and he taught a course called The Age of Johnson. It's about Samuel Johnson and his period, 18th-century British writing. So we all got to endure Samuel Johnson, and Boswell's 'Life of Johnson' is now my favorite book. I read it all the time I can; it's great for going to sleep.","I was in Paris for nine years, starting in '98. One of the great things when I was first there were these wonderful CD collections, selling for almost nothing. For ten euros, you'd get three CDs of all the Gershwin songs.","Whether for company or isolation or just to make it a pleasurable experience, I have music in my ears all the time. I tend to listen to the same things, so I don't really pay too much attention to it. But it's there, and it's nice, and I do pay more attention to it than I probably should. I think, 'How can I use this music in something?'","The great thing for me is how Hitchcock uses guilt so well. He implicates the spectator in the character's field, and you really feel it, and there's incredible relief when it comes out right - if it does come out right.","I like to allow a story to arise as I'm writing scripts. I find it horrible when I try to think of something for the plot without really being on the ground and seeing where it goes.","My family was entirely political, all the time, on the left. The opposite of that is not to be political on the right. It's trying not to be - politics is not everything. There's life other than politics. Politics intrudes.","At the New York Harvard Club, they've moved the memorial for those who died in World Wars I and II up to an obscure little hallway; they used to be in the main hall, in the most prominent location. The sacrifice of those young people I always found so stunning and so admirable.","There's something really admirable about French culture and an attraction in how independent it is from our own. So, it's odd that in other countries that are very American-influenced - who seem to care more about the Oscars than anyone here does - there's both anti-Americanism and also too much America.","It's intimidating for guys to hear women complain about their boyfriends. Guys imagine that girls are thrilled to have them around, and this is what they really talk about.","With all my films, the pace is not very fast, and so people get bored with them and comment that they're just people talking in rooms and all that.","I've gotten to really, really like being back in the States. It's so easy being in your own country, and I really like Americans - typical American towns and provincial college towns are my ideal place to be.","I feel that if you want to make films, you have to be willing to make it without a fee. You get a deferment, I guess.","My friends in Paris are writers, or something like that, whereas my friends in New York are doing cool stuff in finance and living very different lives. In writing, it's pretty solitary, so it doesn't really matter who's around.","What I find remarkable is that so much of the 18th century literature that I read is more accessible than reading your alternative weekly from ten years ago. People really aspired to write clearly.","I love making cheap films. I really do. What I've found is that I work better when it's both a fairly low budget and a short schedule. It focuses the mind, and it's a better atmosphere.","I'm totally devoted to '30s cinema.","I think one of the saving illusions of the film business is everything seems like it's about to happen. It's always about to happen. It's only looking back that you see the wasteland.","Generally, I like people's trunk projects, the things they were working on before anyone knew who they were. I think when people run out of their trunk items and they start doing stuff just to do a film next year, the quality goes down, the interest goes down. Maybe it feels commercial or something.","My whole career, only one person has stepped up to back me. All these people say they like your films. They say this and they say that, but no one actually does anything.","I think sometimes it's the things you don't like that give you inspiration.","I'm the ayatollah of the Jane Austen fan base! I want to lead the fan base, not be attacked and devoured by the fan base.","Oscar Wilde was sort of my first love as a young reader. And then I went on to love Jane Austen's wonderful - this sort of comedy coming from her. I mean, all of her books are comic.","The cinema I particularly love is the cinema of the golden age of the studios in the 1930s. One of the really nice things about it was the way teams of actors and directors and crew people worked together again and again.","It's really important to have subjects that people all over the world are familiar with, and the Disney films are really great that way.","There's certain key dance crazes that are just so much fun - wouldn't that be a great thing to do, to invent a dance?","Really, having a show freely available online is like having your book in the library. It's wonderful; it's ideal.","I always wanted to direct and write a movie, but I thought that I didn't really have it in me. I tried to write fiction and humorous short stories, and some were considered successful, but it was always a huge effort for a small reward. I was always intimidated by the process.","I remember trying to write at 1, 1:30 A.M., and just sort of falling asleep. And I think that was actually a good creative state for weird ideas. I shifted to a morning schedule once I had two kids, and I still found that if I slept badly, I actually had better ideas.","When you're trying to force things in a script, it seems like it's getting somewhere, but it isn't real or interesting. All the bad material you've written becomes an albatross around your neck. So I really don't like writing a lot of bad stuff, I prefer to just keep narrowing it down to stuff I think is solid.","When people are telling stories on screen, you can show the reactions of people, play it off those reactions, and it can be fun. But when it's someone just giving an opinion on things, even if the opinion is kind of interesting, that is potentially deadly. It has to be really quick.","My theory in the '90s was that I didn't want to take a Jane Austen book I loved and reduce it to a 90-minute movie. The Emma Thompson-Ang Lee 'Sense and Sensibility' was beautiful, but other ones, I didn't think justice was being done. It's not a slam dunk to adapt these books.","I identify entirely with Jane Austen's point of view, on everything.","You can be an American or an Englishman or Canadian and be a Parisian. It's a very admirable culture, and people want to identify with it.","I'm very troubled when editors oblige their film critics to read the novel before they see the film. Reading the book right before you see the film will almost certainly ruin the film for you.","I thought I was going to make bigger films for mass audiences. And I wanted that. I actually had in mind a James-Bondian thriller.","I find it preferable not to have public opinions about anything. It's good for me to shut up.","I'm very concerned about the countries bordering Russia. But let's stay off that stuff.","I like things that are sort of comic and humorous rather than satirical.","I really like the short stories that Melissa Bank writes. I think she's sort of channeling the female version of J.D. Salinger in more recent days.","So much of artistic creation is just exclusion. It's not creating things; it's just excluding things that really aren't going to be helpful.","What frustrates me a lot about some aspects of filmmaking is people thinking everyone is really dumb and that we have to make everything really obvious.","I remember going to one party of this preppy, bourgeois crowd, and there was some obnoxious character there, really bad news, and saying, 'Oh my God, so the caricature you always see in films actually exists.'","There are bad preppies and bad priests and bad humanitarians. Any group can have its bad apple.","I love writing novels, but I'm very fearful about writing something from absolute scratch. I kind of don't have the time to write something from scratch. I think when my knees completely give out, and I can't make films anymore, I would try to write novels from scratch.","The only way to end up in the perfect future is to invent it yourself.","I think that, in terms of mainstream storytelling, the rebel gets off way too easy. We're way too hard on the insiders and way too soft on the outsiders.","The thing that was most harmful was that there was always something that was about to happen. So I found myself indulging in the writer's luxury of doing another draft, another idea. If this project isn't happening, then I'll shelve one script and start writing another. And in that way, the years go by, and there's very little money coming in.","Producers have a tendency to put you in a pigeonhole: 'What does this white, middle-aged preppy know about 1960s Kingston?'","I don't like the word 'perfectionist,' because it's self-flattering. It's tooting your own horn and implies that you actually can achieve perfection. I prefer 'particularist.'","A very sad moment for me was when my parents separated - a lot of crying, 'It's tragic, we're now a broken family, blah blah blah blah blah' - although my psychological problems stopped. I actually felt healthier.","I don't think you change from the time you're 16 until you die. Maybe your body changes, and you have different experiences, but I think you become a fully conscious soul with full abilities. Souls are eternal, and if you keep your marbles until you croak in your 90s or your 100s, you're the same.","My guilty pleasure is watching the Investigation Discovery channel.","A brief experience with a Radcliffe girl got very bad very quickly. I was so destroyed by it that I left and went to Mexico for a semester, where I have cousins. I learned how to speak Spanish, which was really important for my life. It was wonderful going to Mexico, learning another culture and a language.","I fell for a Spanish woman and followed her to Spain. We got married there, and then I got involved in the Spanish film industry and got the material for 'Barcelona.' It was my way of breaking into the film industry.","Some critic complained about how many small films are released in New York... it annoyed me. Those small films that are lucky to get two weeks are often my favorite films of the year.","Categorizing people economically and hating them because you think they're this way is a prejudice.","It's a challenge for any writer to write beyond what he knows. You get material, adapt it, and do the best you can with it.","When I'm writing fiction, I read nonfiction or biographies. Now I'm watching very old movies or old foreign films. I don't immerse myself in whatever's going on in whatever area I'm working in.","I kind of put people from the past up on a pedestal; I don't think, in a lot of ways, that we're at their level.","If you're mostly a writer - if your point of departure is writing something - which for a writer/director is sort of where you start, you're really influenced by the writers you love one way or another.","Before, I was writing a script to make a movie. At a certain point, I became A Writer in Film and Television. So I got TV deals to write stuff, film deals to write stuff. But it's dangerous. I got into the WGA, and I became kind of, you know, a slave! They just pay you to write a script, and it's hard to make the movies.","I think one thing that makes me delay projects more than other people is, I see this silver lining in a turn-down. Maybe if I just wrote a script and then pounded my head against all the doors, I would be shooting more films.","One of the reasons it's important to make a new project is it always seems to improve the reputations of the previous one. Whatever you did before is better than what you've just done, apparently. But I've had to follow the first rule of journalism: Never read the comments.","I really like working with people again and again, and I don't know why everyone doesn't do it. Because you already know them, and you know how good they are."],"Whitey Ford":["The way to make coaches think you're in shape in the spring is to get a tan.","Hell, if I didn't drink drink or smoke, I'd win twenty games every year. It's easy when you don't drink or smoke or horse around.","Army life was rough. Would you believe it, they actually wanted me to pitch three times a week.","You would be amazed how many important outs you can get by working the count down to where the hitter is sure you're going to throw to his weakness, and then throw to his power instead.","You kind of took it for granted around the Yankees that there was always going to be baseball in October.","I know Koufax' weakness. He can't hit.","I never threw the spitter, well maybe once or twice when I really needed to get a guy out real bad.","Sooner or later the arm goes bad. It has to... Sooner or later you have to start pitching in pain.","There's no easier pitch to hit than a splitter that doesn't do anything."],"Whitey Herzog":["You sweat out the free agent thing in November then you make the trades in December. Then you struggle to sign the guys left in January and in February I get down to sewing all the new numbers on the uniforms.","Baseball has been good to me since I quit trying to play it.","I'm not buddy-buddy with the players. If they need a buddy, let them buy a dog.","Some people asked me if I would be interested in managing the A's. I said a definite no thank you. At night, that place is a graveyard with lights.","The only way to make money as a manager is to win in one place, get fired and hired somewhere else.","The rules are changed now, there's not any way to build a team today. It's just how much money you want to spend. You could be the world champions and somebody else makes a key acquisition or two and you're through.","We need just two players to be a contender. Just Babe Ruth and Sandy Koufax.","We need three kinds of pitching: left handed, right handed, and relief.","What counts aren't the number of double plays, but the ones you should have had and missed.","The only thing bad about winning the pennant is that you have to manage the All-Star Game the next year. I'd rather go fishing for three days."],"Whitfield Diffie":["Without strong encryption, you will be spied on systematically by lots of people.","Lots of people working in cryptography have no deep concern with real application issues. They are trying to discover things clever enough to write papers about.","Cloud computing is a challenge to security, but one that can be overcome.","It isn't that secrets are never needed in security. It's that they are never desirable.","One of the things that characterizes good intellectual work is a certain self-importance.","I certainly enjoy going on stage and lecturing and talking to Congress. That's a personality explanation. And given government proposals, I thought I had a clear view that they were antagonistic to human freedom.","If you depend on a secret for your security, what do you do when the secret is discovered? If it is easy to change, like a cryptographic key, you do so. If it's hard to change, like a cryptographic system or an operating system, you're stuck. You will be vulnerable until you invest the time and money to design another system.","I thought cryptography was a technique that did not require your trusting other people-that if you encrypted your files, you would have the control to make the choice as to whether you would surrender your files.","If you have ambition, you might not achieve anything, but without ambition, you are almost certain not to achieve anything.","Two people can work on a problem better than one.","We in science are spoiled by the success of mathematics. Mathematics is the study of problems so simple that they have good solutions.","I liked Berkeley tremendously, Berkeley was a very leftist campus. I came to love that city as much as I love Paris or the south of France or New York.","Some people make sharp distinctions sort of between their recreational musings and their professional work. I don't make that distinction very much.","I understood the importance in principle of public key cryptography but it's all moved much faster than I expected. I did not expect it to be a mainstay of advanced communications technology.","People meet in bars after work all over the world and talk about the great problems of life and death and the world and politics and they don't take themselves seriously. They can do nothing else except chat about these things in bars after work.","I thought of computers as very low class. I thought of myself as a pure mathematician and was interested in partial differential equations and topology and things like that.","I really believe in the radical viewpoint. And I have always believed that one's politics and the character of his particular work are inseparable.","I guess, in a very real sense, I'm a Gnostic. I had been looking all my life for some great mystery... I think somewhere deep in my mind is the notion that if I could learn just the right thing, I would be saved.","No right of private conversation was enumerated in the Constitution. I suppose it never occurred to anyone at the time that it could be prevented.","If you are designing cryptosystems, you've got to think about long-term applications. You've got to try to figure out how to build something that is secure against technology in the next century that you cannot even imagine.","I call up Amazon. It seems to me they do a major thing wrong, right. I mean, they protect me against the loss of a $50 liability I have of something on my credit card, but they do nothing to protect me against somebody who is watching to see what books I'm interested in, what new perversions I've developed.","I was, from early on, interested in science. And my parents were very obliging about that. My father used to take me to the museum of natural history, and I knew much more scientific stuff early on. From the time I was 11 or 12, I wanted to be a mathematician.","Intellectual work is essentially a lonely process, and if you can find a way of doing something so that you're in company without being disturbed, that, for me, is the critical thing. I often get to feel isolated so often if I'm sitting either where there aren't people or isn't a view.","Cloud computing means you are doing your computing on somebody else's computer. Looking ahead a little, I firmly believe cloud - previously called grid computing - will become very widespread. It's much cheaper than buying your own computing infrastructure, or maybe you don't have the power to do what you want on your own computer.","People constantly face problems they've never seen before, and they have to solve them somehow. So a million people come up with a million solutions that are just a little bit different. If computing is being done by fewer resources, there will be enormous security gains by pushing things into standard practices.","In a sense, communications networks can be defined entirely by who has cryptographic keys, and I think a lot of networks will work that way in the future.","I think that the people who are trying to shut down WikiLeaks are going to have to accept this as a fact of reality that cryptography allows you to do this kind of thing.","It's simply unrealistic to depend on secrecy for security in computer software. You may be able to keep the exact workings of the program out of general circulation, but can you prevent the code from being reverse-engineered by serious opponents? Probably not. The secret to strong security: less reliance on secrets.","The decisions we make about communication security today will determine the kind of society we live in tomorrow.","I am not convinced that lack of encryption is the primary problem. The problem with the Internet is that it is meant for communications among non-friends.","We have experienced an utter explosion in investigative techniques. Walk the streets, look at the cameras! They are now recognising people automatically from photos; we have DNA fingerprinting, infrascan photos that can identify you from the veins in your face.","People are leaving trails everywhere they go; automated web crawlers tell you an awful lot about their social activities. The flow of information in fundamentally unobtrusive ways into social control organisations has risen dramatically.","I think, and I've thought this for a long time, that we live, roughly speaking, in the last generation of human beings.","The most important impact of technology on communications security is that it draws better and better traffic into vulnerable channels."],"Whitley Strieber":["Every time someone ends a prayer in the Western world they say Amen - that is the name of an Egyptian god associated with completion. So we're still praying to their gods.","I put the copy of 'A Christmas Carol' that my grandfather had first read to me 60 years ago on my desk, and I began to write. The result, for better or for worse, is the 'Christmas Spirits.' I plan to read it to my grandson.","I've always been interested in definitions, because in the Bible, the Ten Commandments are there but there's no real clear definition of what sin is, in a fundamental sense - how we can use the words to evaluate our lives as we go along: Am I doing something that is ethically good? Am I being worthwhile in my life at this moment?","Every Christmas now for years, I have found myself wondering about the point of the celebration. As the holiday has become more ecumenical and secular, it has lost much of the magic that I remember so fondly from childhood.","The interesting thing about fiction from a writer's standpoint is that the characters come to life within you. And yet who are they and where are they? They seem to have as much or more vitality and complexity as the people around you.","I'm not so sure that horror should be dismissed as something less than literature.","The truth is, everything ultimately comes down to the relationship between the reader and the writer and the characters. Does or does not a character address moral being in a universal and important way? If it does, then it's literature.","I've got lots of books sitting here that have never been published because nobody could make any marketing sense of them."],"Whitney Cummings":["After school, I'd wait for someone to pick me up and no one would, so I'd be like, 'I guess I'll walk home.' I had to be a hustler, because nobody did anything for me.","I was joking the other day about how my real life feels like a TV show, and my TV life feels real - because, to be on Thursday nights on NBC, which is what I grew up with, has been such a big part of inspiring me. To be part of that tradition is really completely surreal, and I'm so grateful.","I think that we're in a really amazing time, where there are really a lot of really fantastic female actresses and comedians. I imagine there's just a lot of opportunity for women to have powerful roles. Or it's just that there's more women writing TV. Women tend to maybe write strong women.","I feel like, in a lot of shows where the woman is in charge, the woman is this ball buster and the guy is sort of weak and spineless. And that's never been my experience in a relationship. I think it's much more interesting that the guy is the boss. And there are stakes.","I don't think that women necessarily always write like women. I was a writer on the 'Comedy Central Roasts' for a while, and I always wrote the jokes that people assumed the men would write.","There was a time in L.A. when I drove to 7-Eleven to go grocery shopping, and I locked my keys in my car, which wasn't insured. My wallet was in there, and I couldn't call AAA, because I only had $7 in my bank account. It was one of those moments where I was like, 'O.K., I literally have nothing right now.'","I'm the one who's dating the craft-service guy instead of the producer. Plus, if a producer is going to date a hot young thing, I'm probably not the first person on their list - the weird, quirky, funny girl.","Saying women aren't funny is now like saying Asians can't drive or saying black people have bad credit. It's just really, like, so obsolete.","I did some pretty embarrassing modeling, like catalogs and QVC. I know there's probably a stereotype where all pretty girls think they're unattractive, but modeling is the worst thing for your self-esteem, because you're never pretty enough, you're never thin enough.","I guess the verdict is in - I am not a sociopath. It's not effective or productive not to be nice. It would undermine the goals I want to achieve on any given day.","I remember my agent at ICM at the beginning of my career telling me that I wasn't pretty enough, that I was always going to be a quirky sidekick. And he was an ogre of a man. He should have been carrying a torch. If he was in a bar, he couldn't have come near me, and then he was deciding my fate.","I don't want to look at myself - ever. All I see is that my face is a problem. It's asymmetrical. I get terrible bags under my eyes."],"Whitney Houston":["I have priorities. Maintaining my daughter is my first.","I finally faced the fact that it isn't a crime not having friends. Being alone means you have fewer problems.","I decided long ago never to walk in anyone's shadow; if I fail, or if I succeed at least I did as I believe.","My daughter is my greatest inspiration.","I'm older, I'm matured... I'm looking forward to the years to come. Good years.","I'm just fiercely protective. It's like, that's my lair and nobody messes with my lair.","I like being a woman, even in a man's world. After all, men can't wear dresses, but we can wear the pants.","From the beginning, the camera and I were great friends. It loves me, and I love it.","I'm either my best friend or my worst enemy.","When I decided to be a singer, my mother warned me I'd be alone a lot. Basically we all are. Loneliness comes with life.","God gave me a voice to sing with, and when you have that, what other gimmick is there?","I'm a person who has life and wants to live, and always have.","I'm the kind of person, if, if I have a day that is nerve-wracking, or my week has been bad or something's going down, I won't eat. Some people eat, I don't eat. And it shows in my physical frame.","Loneliness comes with life.","You can fool people. You can fool anybody anytime of the day, but you can't fool yourself. At night, when you go home, you've got to be straight up with you.","When I heard Aretha, I could feel her emotional delivery so clearly. It came from down deep within. That's what I wanted to do.","I've always been a thin girl. I'm not going to be fat, ever. Let's get that straight. Whitney is not going to be fat, ever. Okay?","What's in your soul is in your soul.","In grammar school some of the girls had problems with me. My face was too light. My hair was too long. It was the black-consciousness period, and I felt really bad.","I am not self-destructive. I am not a person who wants to die.","I'm not crazy about arenas just because I can sell them out. It doesn't do anything for my ego at all. I want to play places where people don't have to sit in the nosebleed seats and wonder what the hell is going on.","I believe that children are our future. Teach them well and let them lead the way. Show them all the beauty they possess inside.","I've got some good saints out there - that's right - that pray for me constantly. You've gotta have that! You do.","I wanted to be a teacher. I love children, so I wanted to deal with children. Then I wanted to be a veterinarian. But by the age of ten or eleven, when I opened my mouth and said, 'Oh, God, what's this?' I kind of knew teaching and being a veterinarian were gonna have to wait.","Being around people like Aretha Franklin and Gladys Knight, Dionne Warwick and Roberta Flack, all these greats, I was taught to listen and observe.","No one makes me do anything I don't want to do.","My mother taught me that when you stand in the truth and someone tells a lie about you, don't fight it.","I think over the years, being a mother, I've matured in so many ways.","I love to sing, but it's just not fun anymore.","I'm good where I am at this moment.","I would stay in my room for days, for days at times, just trying to get it together, to know what my next phase was going to be.","I almost wish I could be more exciting, that I could match what is happening out there to me.","Nobody likes to be picked on. Nobody.","I've turned down a lot of arena dates because I've done the big-arena thing. Now, I want to do something where people can feel me and I can feel them.","I have a mother that's very strong and family that surround me and constantly tell me they love me.","My mother was the first singer I had contact with. She sang constantly to us around the house, in church.","When I decided to be a singer, my mother warned me I'd be alone a lot. Basically we all are."],"Whitney M. Young":["Support the strong, give courage to the timid, remind the indifferent, and warn the opposed.","I've been on so many blind dates I should get a free dog.","Our ability to create has outreached our ability to use wisely the products of our invention.","Liberalism seems to be related to the distance people are from the problem.","The hardest work in the world is being out of work."],"Whitney MacMillan":["Food has become such an interesting issue in the nation and the world.","How many soaps does P&G make? In a sense, they're all the same. Can you tell me the difference between trading soybeans, cotton and rubber? They're all soaps to us.","We don't look at what happens in our business in six-month periods."],"Whitney Tilson":["I think that most people who complain about our government have no idea what they're talking about because they've never been to a country with a bad government.","Parents are, of course, most important in shaping their children's lives, but teachers are critically important as well. Who among us doesn't look back on a few great teachers who inspired us, opened up new worlds, and helped make us who we are?","There's a real company in Facebook and then a lot of pretenders riding their coat tails.","While there's always plenty of room for improvement, our government is actually quite effective and efficient. Our military and judicial systems and national parks are the best in the world. Unlike in countries where government corruption is rampant, I've never once been solicited for a bribe.","The mark of a wise person isn't never making mistakes - everyone makes plenty of them. Rather, it's the ability to quickly admit - and fix - them!","While I take no pleasure in others' misfortunes, we've historically made most of our profits from other investors behaving in a panicked and irrational fashion and selling us certain stocks at prices far below their intrinsic value. More volatility equals cheaper stocks, which equals higher returns.","In life, an abundance of confidence gives us higher motivation, persistence, and optimism and can allow us to accomplish things we otherwise might not have undertaken.","My advice to most people is don't short stocks. It's a very, very difficult business. And you can really get clobbered.","If I bring to light a company that's poisoning customers, defrauding investors, or something like that... there just aren't enough regulators in the world to keep up with all of the fraud and malfeasance that goes on out there, particularly in the little nooks and crannies of the market.","When high-growth companies slow down, growth and momentum junkies often sell indiscriminately, which can create great opportunities for value investors. Just be careful not to anchor on the stock's previous price or earnings multiple, which are no longer relevant.","Because I'm a very public figure, everybody knows what my returns are.","Shorting saved my butt in 2008... Shorting kept me in the game. It generates cash when the market's crashing. And that's what you want when the market's crashing - cash.","I am part of the 1 percent of the 1 percent. By that, I mean that I am fortunate to be a wealthy American, and I say, 'It's okay to raise my taxes.'","I think most people agree with the idea of shared sacrifice, but for many, when push comes to shove, that principle goes out the window.","The deal machinations many companies put themselves through, while certainly a bonanza for investment bankers, can confound the typical investor.","Mueller is the leading North American provider of water infrastructure and flow control products - things such as fire hydrants, valves, pipes, fittings, and couplings. While this is no doubt a mundane business, it is also an excellent one.","Pence is far too conservative for me, but by all accounts, he's an intelligent, experienced, decent man with no skeletons in his closet.","In the game of politics, both parties are sometimes guilty of passing really stupid laws that, in reality, are purely symbolic and have no real impact on anyone.","I believe our schools will actually get better if layoffs are done carefully, such that only the very worst teachers are let go.","I love and celebrate good teachers, and it's critical that we do more to identify them and keep them happy and motivated.","There are far too many ineffective teachers and, in particular, far too many truly terrible teachers who are harming children and poisoning the system.","My experience is that very few people have what it takes to be a successful investor, as I discussed in The Arrogance of Stock Picking.","Nirvana, to a value investor, is paying a cheap price for a company that is growing in value every year at a nice rate - this largely explains why today we own stocks like Berkshire Hathaway, McDonald's, Wal-Mart, Microsoft, Costco and Anheuser-Busch.","There is no sure-fire way to get rich quickly. In fact, the pursuit of that usually leads to ruin.","The best way I know to get rich long-term is to invest prudently and conservatively and not try and get rich quick but try and get rich slowly, basically.","The exact details of how you practice value investing will vary investor to investor, but the fundamental principle of scouring the world, looking for dollar bills that you can buy for 50 cents or at some big discount - that is universal to value investing.","I'd say the general outline of a sound investment approach is, first of all, you have to decide are you going to try to be an investor yourself? The answer for most people is probably they shouldn't try. You should put your money in index funds and not try to be a stock picker.","Netflix is a better company with more upside than we had given it credit for than when we shorted it.","I have never believed that large-cap stocks are too well followed to be anything but efficiently priced.","Small-company stocks, like any asset class, can get picked over from time to time, but there are fundamental reasons why diligently mining them with an eye for unrecognised value can get market-beating returns.","The potential rewards of small-cap investing do not come without risk.","The relative illiquidity of small-company shares - which often contributes to their being undervalued - also increases their volatility.","I have long believed the corporate world is plagued by poor capital allocation decisions.","Most chief executives rise to that position by being good operating managers. Few have extensive experience or training with capital allocation. What CEO wants to return excess cash to shareholders when it could be used to expand his or her empire?","My portfolio consists of many companies I find fundamentally undervalued in which I expect activism to play a role in the value being realised.","Well-managed companies with independent boards have nothing to fear from activist shareholders.","The key thing when you short is to make sure you're not wrong on the fundamental intrinsic value.","Early in my career, we were just pure bottoms-up stock pickers.","If you look at the history of technology gadget makers, hardware makers, it's littered with the corpses of Palm and RIM and companies like that.","We call ourselves 'opportunistic value investors.'","We like to say we pray in the church of Graham, Dodd, Buffett, and Munger.","Investing is a probabilistic business. Every once in a while, it's sort of like you're throwing six-sided dice, and anything except a one or a two, you're doing well. Statistically speaking, you throw the dice enough times, you're going to throw a one or a two five times in a row, and you're going to look pretty foolish, right?","You just have to approach every day and say, 'If you were starting fresh today, what would my portfolio look like?' So that's how we think about it.","Humans are hard-wired to be irrational when it comes to financial decisions. We must understand that so we don't become the sucker at the poker table.","It's human nature: for most investors, the pain of stocks going down is more tangible than the joy of when they go up. The common impulse is to do something - anything - to minimise the pain.","One of the best places to look for value is what I call 'babies thrown out with the bathwater' - in other words, scour the most out-of-favour sectors for good companies whose stocks have been crushed due to overblown concerns about the industry that do not, in fact, have an impact on the company.","Even the greatest companies encounter problems or otherwise fall out of favour.","It's difficult to fix a truly broken business, but when it happens, the returns can be extraordinary.","Many significant stock-price inefficiencies can occur when a company is spun off.","When it comes to owning stocks of the best-known businesses in the world, value investors usually feel like children looking through the window of the candy store, unable to afford the treats inside because they refuse to pay the prices such high-quality franchises typically bear.","I have encountered thousands of value investors over the years and am constantly struck by their differences - and their similarities.","There is a natural tendency for investors to devote a significant majority of their time to finding new ideas. After all, uncovering great companies selling at great prices is the lifeblood of successful investing. But in the never-ending quest for the next great idea, investors often give short shrift to their existing investments.","While everyone would love to have that perfect portfolio of stocks that can be bought and held forever, it usually does not work out that way. Markets, technology, and businesses change too quickly to put portfolios on autopilot.","When reviewing one's portfolio, it is important to be aware of common mental mistakes that may lead to bad decisions. The most powerful is commitment bias, which, as manifested in investing, is the tendency to fall in love with one's stocks.","Assessing management quality is clearly one of the most important aspects of an investment decision.","To a large extent, equity investors put their hard-earned capital into the hands of management and count on it being employed skilfully and honestly. When that doesn't happen, losses typically follow.","One can't be a successful investor without a healthy dose of confidence. To commit your own and others' hard-earned capital requires conviction, and conviction requires confidence. But as with fine brandy or coffee ice cream, too much of a good thing can be problematic.","The consequences of overestimating a company and your ability to analyse it are greatly diminished when you're paying a lot less for it than your analysis shows it is worth.","It's critical to have a disciplined investing approach and stick with it.","As in most subjects relating to money management, there's a wide diversity of opinion on portfolio concentration versus diversification.","Without doubt, timely and democratic access to financial and market information contributes to smoothly functioning financial markets.","No one would suggest completely ignoring news about your investments. Enron investors, for example, would have been well served to sell once early reports of accounting irregularities surfaced. But the key is to keep news in context and act only if further reflection or study indicates that the core thesis for an investment has changed.","Dealing with uncertainty is always a key challenge for investors. But dealing with uncertainty doesn't mean avoiding it - on the contrary, it is often fuzziness about a company's future that creates the type of opportunity bargain-hunting investors cherish.","Wall Street, in the main, hates uncertainty, which manifests itself in depressed share prices of companies whose prospects lack 'visibility.' But where the market can err is in confusing uncertainty with risk.","Just because a company's future is highly uncertain doesn't mean an investment in it is risky. In fact, some of the best potential investments are highly uncertain but have little risk of permanent capital loss."],"Whitney Wolfe":["Life is about perspective and how you look at something... ultimately, you have to zoom out.","Feminism is not about girl power. It is about equal power.","There is no better way to create a confident and meaningful connection with someone than to be self-assured and true to yourself. Remember, you want someone to truly appreciate you for you, not for your best side. There is only one you. Be proud of that and own it.","The men who use Bumble appreciate a confident woman, a woman who has a voice. A lot of men suffer from insecurity and fear rejection, too. Bumble removes that fear, as they don't have to make the first move, so it benefits both men and women.","Have a dream, chase it down, jump over every single hurdle, and run through fire and ice to get there.","I am a huge advocate for anti-bullying in our youth. What I have seen with the rise of social media is that children are not facing bullying on a playground, they are facing it on their cell phones.","If you're in a job that you hate, don't be scared of seeking out something that might be riskier. Anything can turn into something with passion and hard work.","Being able to put your blinders on, ignore negative opinions, and follow your strong intuition is what's validating to me. It's a great feeling to know you can trust your gut.","In real life, we are all on our devices. We might go to a place where we fit the crowd and could meet someone. But, because we are all on our phones, you might not notice the cute boy behind you in line for coffee, and he's not going to notice the gorgeous girl sitting outside. So, we might as well notice them on our phones, on Tinder.","How does a queen bee behave? However she wants to. But please don't wait for someone to hold the door open for you when your own arms work perfectly fine - do it yourself.","We are becoming so fickle and self involved. Always looking for the next best thing - especially when it comes to people. We spend hours buried in our phones trying to keep up with the social lives of people we may not even know. Envy and the fear of missing out have taken over. Yet we are all still longing for human connection.","In our digital age, the Golden Rule is not enforced online.","Look at what is broken in society, figure out how to make it better, and then, around that, formulate a business.","Now, women are expected to be equal to men in so many capacities - financially, career-wise, in education - yet the one disconnect was, and is, with relationships.","I was always extremely creative. I was very artistic and never strong with numbers or science. I wanted to be an artist or a fashion designer. I wanted to be something that allowed for a lot of imagination.","Who asks who out on the date? Who's supposed to pay for dinner? Who chooses where you go? Both partners should be involved in these discussions. If we want to be treated as equals, don't put yourself in a position where you set yourself up to not be equal.","I really try to ask myself the question of nine. Will this matter in nine minutes, nine hours, nine days, nine weeks, nine months or nine years? If it will truly matter for all of those, pay attention to it.","I truly believe that what we're seeing with online dating is very similar to what happened with the Myspace-Facebook era, where Myspace was once this place for online connecting for a very select group of young people. And then Facebook kind of hit at this moment where it was acceptable for everybody to do it.","Anyone can replicate a product. There are lots of brilliant minds out there that know how to code, but there's unique DNA to a brand. You cannot have a brand without people. That is the most important asset you will ever have.","After graduating in International Relations in 2011, I turned down safe, corporate job offers and instead accepted a position at an 'incubator' in L.A. - a tech word for a team of people who are funded by investors to create apps. I knew the future was digital and that I had to take a risk.","My best advice for a new Tinder user is don't just start swiping left or right. Take a moment and really evaluate everyone's photos before you say 'yes' or 'no.' Sometimes people don't know what they are doing when choosing photos.","I am a firm believer that the only person who can make you feel inferior is yourself.","The beauty of Bumble and this world of online connecting is it gives you access. Going down to the bar, what is your access? What is the access you're gaining there? Really, only a few people.","Safety is something you should never have to pay for. If you're abusive or, say, not who you say you are on Bumble, you're gone. We have a zero tolerance policy.","I have so many girlfriends who are powerhouses: They have big careers, are fearless in traveling in third-world countries or a launching non-profit. But they won't text a guy for fear of being perceived as desperate. That is broken.","I realized that there's a big world, and really, the only way you can make a critical impact on something greater than your own little world is through technology.","I personally have always hated dating. I was never vulnerable or insecure in any part of my life, but I would become that way with a guy because they have control, according to society, when it comes to dating.","There's an assumption that women don't start companies that earn more than X amount of dollars, or that have more than X amount of users, and Bumble is now really growing into one of the main players if you look at all the mainstream social-media platforms.","I'm very artistic and creative, disorganised - ambitious, I would say, if that even makes sense. I'm definitely not the most mathematical person in the world; not scientific. I can't even work out a tip; it's really sad. But I've always thought, play up your strengths and let someone else handle your weaknesses. It's OK. Work together.","Usually, it's men who run these big monster companies, and girl companies are usually much smaller - it's like an unwritten tech-industry stigma.","I can guarantee that back in the day, if a woman was left alone and she needed to eat, she would have to hunt. It's not biological imperative that says men have to ask us out; it's social conditioning. And we can change it.","Books such as 'The Rules' and 'He's Just Not That Into You' need to go out of the window.","Every point in your career is a learning lesson - I learned a lot about how much work is required to grow a user base and create a new product. I also learned that things take time and extreme hard work and passion.","Bumble really sets the stage for an empowered and modern way to connect, which educated and forward-thinking groups of people have really gravitated to.","Don't be afraid to let someone go if it's not working. You're not a bad boss. You're not a bad CEO.","You have to accept people for who they are. You can guide. You can give people chances. But you cannot hold on to people in fear that you are bad because you can't keep everyone you've hired.","Online, I would never friend a random cute guy on Facebook or start liking his pictures on Instagram - even if I had a crush on him. But with Tinder, it's like following or friending each other at the same time. The risk of revealing your feelings is removed.","Be genuine. Put out what you want to receive; that's the same for real life and Tinder.","When you accept that failure is a good thing, it can actually be a huge propeller toward success.","When you can look at failure and say, 'What is the worst case scenario,' it's not as bad as it seems.","Failure's a marker of success in its own right because you went out and tried something... If you really don't want to fail, go find a comfortable chair and stay there. Just don't go out and do anything.","My goal is not to overtake Tinder or compete with Tinder. To be fully honest with you, I think Tinder is a great product. It's still my baby at the end of the day. So I wish it continued success. I still have equity in Tinder.","I just hope that more women realize that if your gut tells you you're doing a good job, you're doing a good job.","I remember, when we were starting Tinder, we were like, 'We're going to be the next Instagram!' I remember sending my parents emails being like, 'We got 300 members!'","I sleep with the drapes open to rise with the sun. I think that's a healthy thing to do because even if you don't like to wake up early, your body does adjust.","What I have found is that the best way to unwind is cooking. You only have two hands. If you are chopping veggies, you are forcing yourself to put the phone down or step away from the computer. It's extremely relaxing.","I'm going to be honest. Up until I started work on Bumble, the 'f-word' scared me. People would ask me if I was a feminist, and I didn't know how to respond. The word seemed to put guys off, but now I realise, who cares?","Everyone in the dating business wants to know what women want - it's the billion-dollar question. But it's simple: put one in charge, and you find out.","When I first got started in this whole world of online connecting, we were combating this antiquated stereotype of who used online dating, and we really set out to make it popular with millennials. What I find to be so fascinating now is, I'm seeing an inverse in that trend.","When I left Tinder, I had no intention of getting back into the dating industry. What I ultimately wanted to do was start this contagious complimentary social network, where kindness was at the helm.","I'm a pretty private person. I live in Texas, and I like my small network.","I cannot compare and contrast Tinder and Bumble directly, but I will say that we have a very impressive, forward-thinking user base.","It's an epidemic. Instead of socialising and having proper conversations, we're staring at pictures of models in bikinis and wondering how they look like that. It's like self-loathing.","I worked all day, every day. I thought about Tinder in the shower and dreamed about it at night. It wasn't just my job - it was my life.","I guarantee that if you threw 100 people into a room, the first three questions they would ask each other are: 'Where did you grow up?,' 'Where did you go to school?' and 'What do you do for a living?' Most people on Bumble are looking for a life partner, and those things have a huge impact on compatibility.","One of the biggest things I tell women is not to lose themselves in a relationship. If you're willing to alter yourself to find somebody, it'll never work.","If you truly want to find a meaningful relationship, you've got to find yourself first and learn to be confident in your own skin. Don't sacrifice anything about who you are to be with someone. That's setting yourself up for failure.","There's nothing wrong with taking yourself out of the dating pool. You don't need to be in a relationship because that's what society expects of you or because your grandmother thinks you need to be married by a certain date. Those days are over. Instead, take a step back and say, 'I'm OK alone.'","Always know your merit and how special you are, and don't let someone else's qualifications make you feel small. If you stick to this, you will always deserve their respect.","We have all been there: we see that gorgeous person across the room, and we want to go and speak to them so badly. However, the 'rules' of society mean we usually don't end up doing it, despite our friends' best efforts to convince us to. Time for a change. Be empowered and say hi! It's proven that people really like it when you take initiative.","When you're setting up your dating profile, choose the photos according to who you are today. A variety of recent shots that are a true representation of your character.","I think that a big shame of how women are approached in business is they're oftentimes looked to for perspective and not implementation.","My biggest struggle being a woman in the workforce has not only been with my mother, my grandmother, and a lot of my girlfriends. When I'm working late hours, I'm almost punished for it by them. It's almost absurd that I would prioritize work over catching up with my girlfriends. If I were a man, that would just come second nature.","If we want to create change, we all have to be feminists - men, women, everyone needs to acknowledge that. Sometimes I have more in common with the man than I do the woman in the room.","Honestly, I'd rather hug than shake hands. I don't know where those hands have been!"],"Whittaker Chambers":["Every man is crucified upon the cross of himself.","The chief fruit of the First World War was the Russian Revolution and the rise of Communism as a national power.","Tragedy occurs when a human soul awakes and seeks, in suffering and pain, to free itself from crime, violence, infamy, even at the cost of life. The struggle is the tragedy - not defeat or death.","I do not know any way to explain why God's grace touches a man who seems unworthy of it.","For in this century, within the next decades, will be decided for generations whether all mankind is to become Communist, whether the whole world is to become free, or whether, in the struggle, civilization as we know it is to be completely destroyed or completely changed.","I see in Communism the focus of the concentrated evil of our time.","My children, as long as you live, the shadow of the Hiss Case will brush you. In every pair of eyes that rests on you, you will see pass, like a cloud passing behind a woods in winter, the memory of your father - dissembled in friendly eyes, lurking in unfriendly eyes.","It is popular to call it a crisis of the Western world. It is in fact a crisis of the whole world. Communism, which claims to be a solution of the crisis, is itself a symptom and an irritant of the crisis.","On a scale personal enough to be felt by all, but big enough to be symbolic, the two irreconcilable faiths of our time - Communism and Freedom - came to grips in the persons of two conscious and resolute men.","The Communist vision is the vision of man without God.","On that road of the informer, it is always night. I cannot ever inform against anyone without feeling something die within me. I inform without pleasure, because it is necessary.","When you understand what you see, you will no longer be children. You will know that life is pain, that each of us hangs always upon the cross of himself. And when you know that this is true of every man, woman and child on earth, you will be wiser.","A man is not primarily a witness against something. That is only incidental to the fact that he is a witness for something.","A witness, in the sense that I am using the word, is a man whose life and faith are so completely one that when the challenge comes to step out and testify for his faith, he does so, disregarding all risks, accepting all consequences.","At issue in the Hiss Case was the question whether this sick society, which we call Western civilization, could in its extremity still cast up a man whose faith in it was so great that he would voluntarily abandon those things which men hold good, including life, to defend it.","At issue was the question whether this man's faith could prevail against a man whose equal faith it was that this society is sick beyond saving, and that mercy itself pleads for its swift extinction and replacement by another.","Human societies, like human beings, live by faith and die when faith dies.","Political freedom is a political reading of the Bible.","A nation's life is about as long as its reverential memory.","In 1937, I began, like Lazarus, the impossible return.","I know that I am leaving the winning side for the losing side, but it is better to die on the losing side than to live under Communism."],"Whoopi Goldberg":["That's the thing about Mother Nature, she really doesn't care what economic bracket you're in.","I am the American Dream. I am the epitome of what the American Dream basically said. It said you could come from anywhere and be anything you want in this country. That's exactly what I've done.","I used my imagination to make the grass whatever color I wanted it to be.","When you are kind to someone in trouble, you hope they'll remember and be kind to someone else. And it'll become like a wildfire.","Normal is nothing more than a cycle on a washing machine.","I don't really view communism as a bad thing.","If every American donated five hours a week, it would equal the labor of 20 million full-time volunteers.","I don't look like Halle Berry. But chances are she's going to end up looking like me.","I'm a big old egotistical baby and that's okay. I can accept it.","I am where I am because I believe in all possibilities.","An actress can only play a woman. I'm an actor, I can play anything.","We're born with success. It is only others who point out our failures, and what they attribute to us as failure.","Most of all, I dislike this idea nowadays that if you're a black person in America, then you must be called African-American. Listen, I've visited Africa, and I've got news for everyone: I'm not an African.","I think the idea that you know who your inner self is on a daily basis, because... you know. What's good for you 25 years ago may not be good for you now. So, to keep in touch with that, I think that's the first ingredient for success. Because if you're a successful human being, everything else is gravy, I think.","It's being willing to walk away that gives you strength and power - if you're willing to accept the consequences of doing what you want to do.","I don't have pet peeves; I have whole kennels of irritation.","I have the strangest time to get cast in anything. 'Ghost' was the same thing. Six months I had to wait for them to decide they had seen everybody possible. Why not? What limits me? I'm black? Oh, am I black?","For some reason, all artists have self-esteem issues.","I grew up in a time when it would never have occurred to anyone to tell me there was anything I couldn't do.","You know, be an actor because you love to act. Don't be an actor because you think you're going to get famous, because that's luck.","I am an artist, art has no color and no sex.","I'm fighting the label of 'Black' actress simply because it's very limiting in people's eyes, especially people who are making movies.","My family is Jewish, Buddhist, Baptist and Catholic. I don't believe in man-made religions.","I'm as American as Chevrolet.","All I really want to do is just keep acting, and some of it will stink, and some of it will be really good, and maybe when I'm 85 and presenting an Oscar like Bette Davis did, I can look back and say, 'It was okay, I did all right.'","Just call me black, if you want to call me anything.","Normal is in the eye of the beholder.","And I don't believe that I have to stay on one side of the fence or the other. I don't believe that there is any good career move or bad career move. I believe there are only the things that make me happy.","Born ham, that's basically me.","Sitting at the table during Color Purple and looking up and suddenly realizing I was acting in front of Steven Spielberg, was pretty cool. It was pretty good.","Things happen to you out of luck, and if you get to stick around it's because you're talented.","When I started, I knew I didn't fit any visual that anyone was going to lie down and take their clothes off about. Work doesn't come to me; I go out and look for it.","The art of acting is to be other than what you are.","I want Carl Sagan to explain the sky to me.","You've got to vote for someone. It's a shame, but it's got to be done.","When I listen to these women, it makes what I thought were my hard knocks feel like little nudges.","The Africans know I'm not an African. I'm an American.","Actors have no color. That's the art form.","It bums me out tremendously what the church has become, and if it's got me bummed, imagine what Jesus Christ must be feeling.","When I was doing ensemble theater and comedy work, I felt I had some talents. But when I started doing my shows in Berkeley and found that I could be funny on my own, I was shocked.","Everything for me is visual. That's just how my head works.","I don't have to be bam, bam, bam, funny when I'm working. I can tell stories, and there's some funny in them.","If I was doing a talk show, I would do the kind of show that comes on just once a month, with amazing guests.","There are roles I am never considered for. Meryl Streep roles, let's say. Why not? I really wanted to do 'Ironweed,' for example, because the depression era in this country was one of the best for multiracial people, because everybody was poor. Everybody lived in the tents, and under buildings, and under gratings, together."],"Wietse Venema":["Lack of documentation is becoming a problem for acceptance.","One bug in an SMTP server can open up the whole machine for intrusion.","My reply is: the software has no known bugs, therefore it has not been updated.","The challenge with Postfix, or with any piece of software, is to update software without introducing problems.","This will surprise some of your readers, but my primary interest is not with computer security. I am primarily interested in writing software that works as intended.","Defect-free software does not exist.","As of today, the Postfix mail transport agent has almost 50,000 lines of code, comments not included.","However, writing software without defects is not sufficient. In my experience, it is at least as difficult to write software that is safe - that is, software that behaves reasonably under adverse conditions.","Writing software that's safe even in the presence of bugs makes the challenge even more interesting.","When I write software, I know that it will fail, either due to my own mistake, or due to some other cause.","In a previous life I wrote the software that controlled my physics experiments. That software had to deal with all kinds of possible failures in equipment. That is probably where I learned to rely on multiple safety nets inside and around my systems.","Coming back to the topic of computer security, the TCP Wrapper is an example of such a safety net. I wrote it when my systems were under attack by someone who appeared to walk through walls.","I was going to visit IBM for six months as a visiting scientist. Now, six months is a lot of time, so I came with a whole list of projects that I might want to work on.","At the time the Sendmail program had a very poor reputation with respect to security, with four root vulnerabilities per year for two successive years.","The Postfix security model is based on keeping software simple and stupid.","I want to avoid locking people into solutions that work only with Postfix. People should have a choice in what software they want to use with Postfix, be it anti-virus or otherwise.","Qmail out of the box works fine, so people will want to use it regardless of licensing restrictions, even when the software does not ship with their system software.","Like all software, Qmail can survive only when it keeps up with changing requirements.","Most of the effort in the software business goes into the maintenance of code that already exists.","Adding functionality is not just a matter of adding code.","Windows favors multi-threading, which means that a service is implemented by one single process.","Postfix keeps running even if one Postfix process dies; Windows requires that someone restarts the service.","I don't expect an overnight change of all desktops to what the US Military used to call B3 level security. And even that would not stop users from shooting themselves into the foot.","For many people my software is something that you install and forget. I like to keep it that way."],"Wil S. Hylton":["Desertion is the army's dirty little secret. Since the beginning of the Iraq war, more than 20,000 American soldiers have given up the fight. Most of them disappear while at home on leave, fading into a network of family and friends, and the army does not typically chase them down.","Apart from the most obvious cases, like the Oriental Bittersweet vine, escaped from private gardens and smothering the mountains one acre at a time, the most painful proof of man's destruction is not what you can see right in front of you; it's what you will never see again.","If Yucca Mountain had not been designated as a dumpsite for radioactive waste in 1987, it might easily have become a scenic overlook on the long drive between Tonopah and Las Vegas.","Way up high in the Shenandoah Mountains where I live, it is difficult to maintain illusions about the natural world. It is dying.","The park lies directly downwind from a slew of coal plants. Virtually all of the major contaminants in the local air and water are direct results of coal emissions. Coal produces ozone, which kills trees. Coal produces sulfates, which kill fish. No other park in the country has more ozone or sulfates than Shenandoah National Park.","I have never considered myself anything other than an environmentalist. I have spent the better part of my life either in the wilderness, or trying desperately to get there.","The tension between public and private science is powerful.","During the Vietnam era, more than 30,000 draft dodgers and deserters sought harbor in cities like Montreal and Toronto, where public opposition to the war was strong and most residents didn't question their motives.","The tragedy of Eliot Spitzer is almost Greek: Ascendant son of wealth and privilege dedicates his life to social justice, warns of the corruption lurking among us, and falls victim to his inner demons at the very moment of vindication.","Many experts are concerned that the parents who need safe havens the most are the least likely to use them.","Exactly who does use the safe-haven laws is difficult to discern. Most states make no effort to study the cases or compile any data, and the anonymous nature of the process makes outside research nearly impossible.","In an instant, the law was transformed: from the last passenger on the safe-haven bandwagon to a pioneer into uncharted territory. For the first time in American history, it was not only legal to relinquish a baby; in Nebraska, it was okay to abandon any child of any age for any reason at any time - with the full protection of the law.","Since losing his reelection in 2002, Barr has lost not only his power but also many of his friends. It doesn't help that after alienating nearly every Democrat with impeachment, he spent the next five years alienating his fellow Republicans - railing against the invasion of Iraq, the PATRIOT Act, and the Bush administration in general."],"Wil Wheaton":["It's nearly impossible to enforce actual consequences in video games at the moment, but at a table, sitting face-to-face across a tabletop game, or even playing at a LAN party, sportsmanship matters.","I fell in love with Dungeons & Dragons, and the storytelling of it, and the weird dice, and the fact that it didn't use a traditional board. It felt like I was a part of something special and almost kind of like a secret club because a lot of people didn't know what it was and didn't understand it.","Anonymity, in some cases a key civil liberty, also enables society's worst actors.","It probably wasn't until I was a freshman in high school and I met the people who became my gaming group that I finally found people who were weird like I was: that loved reading and playing games and not just watching a science fiction or fantasy movie but talking all about it.","When a person makes fun of you, when a person is cruel to you, it has nothing to do with you. It's not about what you said. It's not about what you did. It's not about what you love. It's about them feeling bad about themselves.","I really try my best to be the person I want other people to be.","I think the default position of humans is to be terrible, and we have to train it out of our children. That's just part of survival, right? Predator animals don't survive by being nice; humans are basically predator animals.","I spent a lot of my childhood not fitting in, in a lot of different ways.","I was obsessed with 'Ghostbusters.'","'Ghost Adventures,' 'Mountain Monsters,' weird alien UFO shows like 'Ancient Aliens.' The people who are self-appointed experts in these fields are really a series of national treasures.","Even when I was little, people would always ask me if I wanted to be a movie star, and I would always say, 'No, I just want to be an actor.'","If the world were a bar, America would currently be the angry drunk waving around a loaded gun. Yeah, the other people in the bar may be afraid of him, but they sure as hell don't respect him.","I'm guess I'm up to about 70% of normal, which is a real relief. My doctor gave me clearance to go out in public again, so I've been able to go to the store and help out a little bit around the house.","I would love to find myself in a position where I have to decide, 'Gosh, do I want to be on a series?'","Even when I was little and going on auditions, it was clear who was there because they wanted to be there, and who was there because their stage parents were making them be there. There was a major difference.","When you get a group of kids together, especially boys, the psychology of those kids requires that they find a weak kid or a sensitive kid or a soft kid.","I've done a lot of geeky things in my life, but I think the geekiest of all was my first effort to build props and cosplay, when I was about twelve years-old.","People who don't want to give a creator money are never going to give a creator money.","When you say a 'former child star,' you may as well say 'failed child star.'","One of the things that drives me crazy is the belief in Hollywood that bittorrent exists solely for stealing things.","Some ISPs are blocking all BitTorrent traffic, because BitTorrent can be used to share files in a piratical way. Hollywood lobbying groups are trying to pass laws which would force ISPs to block or degrade BitTorrent traffic, too. Personally, I think this is like closing down freeways because a bank robber could use them to get away.","Someone who I would describe as a 'geek' or 'nerd' is a person who loves something to its greatest extent and then looks for other people who love it the same way so they can celebrate loving it together.","I'm basically a professional nerd, and I'm still not cool. I'm around people who are cool sometimes, and I know I'm not them. But that's OK; I don't care.","To be sure, anonymity online has it uses and is very important. Governments hoover up people's telephone and e-mail records without oversight, and companies track astonishingly granular personal information.","I love tabletop and video games, which should be open and inclusive to everyone.","Paranormal reality shows are some of the best unintentional comedy in the history of recorded entertainment.","I was lucky to have been a seven-year-old kid when I saw 'Star Wars.'","To the best of my knowledge, a lot of people who play video games also play tabletop games and vice versa.","One of the things that I've never seen in tabletop gaming is this juvenile notion that the existence of a game that I don't like, or the existence of a gamer who's different than me, threatens my very existence and the very existence of my hobby.","I go around the country, and I speak to colleges, conferences and thousands of people at a time, and I'm like, 'Great. Fine. Whatever.' Coming to speak to about 60 kids, I am scared to death.","I'm very lucky in that I was inspired by science fiction while I was a little kid, and I was interested in science and technology and was encouraged to pursue those interests.","To understand a field, you look at its arts. Arts can be cautionary as well as inspiring.","I obviously pursued a career in the arts but always wondered if I had just been supported a little more in math, as opposed to it being 'a thing I had to learn,' how that would have changed things for me.","I want people to understand and embrace that the art that inspires our technological dreams is just as important as the tech it helps us create.","When I was a boy, I was called a nerd all the time - because I didn't like sports, I loved to read, I liked math and science, I thought school was really cool - and it hurt a lot. Because it's never OK when a person makes fun of you for something you didn't choose. You know, we don't choose to be nerds.","I'm privileged to occasionally stand on a table, and people listen to what I say, and in those moments, it's important to me that I have something to say and that I honor it.","One of the things that I'm very proud to stand up and yell about is that we need to end gatekeeping in our society. We need to stop people from saying, 'You need to pass the test if you're going to come in here and do this.'","Being a nerd is not about what you love; it's about the way you love it."],"Wilbur Mills":["What I wanted to do was see if we couldn't balance the budget.","President Johnson had a habit of throwing dollars at a question and the question would disappear.","We wanted to be certain they didn't have a bigger deficit, and Kennedy agreed with me."],"Wilbur Ross":["It's important to have a sound idea, but the really important thing is the implementation.","The one term I don't like to be called is a 'vulture.' Because to me, a vulture is a kind of asset-stripper that eats dead flesh off the bones of a dead creature. Our bird should be the phoenix, the bird that reinvents itself, recreates itself from its ashes. And that's much closer to what it is that we really do.","You cannot just keep borrowing more and more and keep spending more and more without eventually having a day of reckoning.","I see myself as a private-equity investor that helps rebuild companies. Restructuring is a cottage industry in that there aren't that many serious practitioners.","The fact that you're successful doesn't mean that you can't relate to working people.","I think what we have to do is figure out how to make sure we get the benefits of improved technology and yet cope with the dislocation that it will inevitably produce in certain industries.","The E.U., China, and Japan all talk free trade, and they all practice protectionism.","Everybody talks about tariffs as the first thing. Tariffs are the last thing. Tariffs are part of the negotiation. The real trick is going to be increase American exports. Get rid of some of the tariff and non-tariff barriers to American exports.","Banking, I would argue, is the most heavily regulated industry in the world. Regulations don't solve things. Supervision solves things.","I don't think there's anything inherently wrong with a bank being big. In fact, there are some good arguments about universality of geography that in theory, if you have all your eggs in one little community, and some big employer goes out, that could be your downfall.","My wife Hillary sometimes accuses me of trying to reinvent the 19th century. In some ways she's right because I like things that I can understand and that aren't too complicated.","To me, the most terrifying form of warfare would be if there was some simultaneous cyber attack on our grid, on the banking system, and on our transportation system. That would be quite a devastating thing, and yet in theory, absent some real protective measures, that could happen.","We are the world's biggest importer. We need to treat the other countries as good suppliers.","The whole idea of a trade deal is to build a fence around participants inside and give them an advantage over the outside. So there's a conceptual flaw in that, one of many conceptual flaws in NAFTA.","I think at the end of the day, the real sick man of Europe is liable to turn out to be France, not Greece, not Portugal, not Spain, not Italy. The reason is France is very uncompetitive to begin with on a global scale, and the measures that Hollande has been putting in have been very, very negative from the point of view of economic growth.","The fundamentals are the U.S. is going to end up being a net exporter of natural gas. That's going to be wonderful to help our balance of payments, reduce our dependence on a lot of countries that aren't so crazy about us, and change many, many parts of what goes on here.","The problem with regional trade agreements is you get picked apart by the first country. Then you negotiate with the second country. You get picked apart. And you go with the third one. You get picked apart again.","I believe in the two-party system.","NAFTA is an ancient treaty.","Believe it or not, Mexico has better treaties with the rest of the world than the Unites States does.","The rules of origin in NAFTA need some tightening. Rules of origin are what let material outside of NAFTA to come in and benefit from all the taxes and tariff reductions within NAFTA.","In many critical things, such as the very high purity of the aluminium we need in aerospace, we only have one producer. That's not a good formula.","We're in a trade war. We've been in a trade war for decades. That's why we have the deficit.","Confrontational things, admission of error, admission of defeat, restructuring, laying people off - those are not American ideals.","China is the world's biggest exporter, but they're also the people with one of the highest tariffs on imports in the whole world. That seems a little bit oxymoronic.","Generally speaking, companies get into bankruptcy as a kind of meritocracy. Somebody made some sort of big mistake, to get into bankruptcy, and very often, a part of the mistake is too much leverage.","Between the Community Redevelopment Act, requiring banks to make what I would call very weak loans, and specific quotas that the Congress imposed on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, that created the market demand that really led to the subprime phenomenon.","I think it's natural for any manager to want to grow his business. The question is at what rate, and in what direction, and in what format?","Shipping has a great oversupply of vessels that came from over-ordering a few years back. We think 2014 may be when it turns around.","Shale gas, if left to flourish, could create several hundred thousand more jobs.","The typical big Japanese company has somewhere between a third and 40 percent of its revenues coming from developing countries, and about a third of Japan's exports are also to the emerging countries, so in a strange way, Japan, which has very little internal growth, its big companies are a good way to play the emerging markets.","There is no evidence that more regulation makes things better. The most highly regulated industry in America is commercial banking, and that didn't save those institutions from making terrible decisions.","Each weekend I play at least one and maybe two sets of tennis a day. My doubles team was in the finals recently at my tennis club in Palm Beach and lost a tiebreaker after a three-hour match. I must confess, by the end of the three hours, I was relieved it was over.","Ships are a strange kind of commodity because they're very lumpy, very big individual units, but they're commodities.","If you want to do something to destroy consumer spending, just eat away at the middle class because the other problem we have is the structural problem of middle class America.","Mexico has 44 treaties with other countries that make it very advantageous to do international shipping from Mexico rather than from the United States. Believe it or not, Mexico has better treaties with the rest of the world than the United States does.","Many of the smaller banks have had to get to the point where they now have more compliance people than they have lending offices. That's crazy.","Part of the reason why I'm supporting Trump is that I think we need a more radical, new approach to government - at least in the U.S. - from what we've had before.","If you add up all the promises any politician makes, the math doesn't work. Hillary Clinton's math doesn't work; Donald's math probably doesn't work. I think you have to listen to their campaign pitches more as symbolic, more as metaphors.","Washington, D.C., is the new Wall Street. No significant financial transaction of any consequence occurs without it.","Regulations don't solve things. Supervision solves things. If we could figure out that the subprime thing was a train wreck that was coming, where were the regulators?","We think, over the long term, the real key to value of a bank is does it have true deposits from true long-term customers? People who actually know the bank, live in the neighborhood, work there, maybe have a mortgage there, credit card... That, to us, is the key to a bank.","There isn't a bank in the world that could withstand a run. They all borrow short and lend long, regardless of what they say.","If you think about it: a big bank in any country, what is it? Really, as an investment, it's a warrant on economy.","One of the problems with industries that have been in relatively long-term declines is that, very often, the managements in those industries develop a kind of loser mentality. And when you ask them what's wrong with the business, they'll point to extraneous forces.","Absent some international interruption, there's no real justification for oil being more than $90 or $100 a barrel.","I think there's a big difference between the impact of trade agreements on corporate America and the impact on Mr. and Mrs. America. Corporate America has adjusted to them by investing lots of capital offshore... What we're doing is we're exporting jobs and importing products instead of exporting products and keeping jobs.","Hillary Clinton can't tell a good trade deal from bad one.","China is the most protectionist country of the very large countries. They talk more about free trade than they actually practice.","I am not anti-trade. I am pro-trade. But I am pro-sensible trade.","I'm a very big proponent of cloud. We've used it a lot in private sector, and as far as we can tell, it is not only more efficient, it's probably also more secure for lots of very complicated technical reasons. I think it's a very important thing for government to do, and also to have systems that talk to each other.","Barring some national security concern, I see no valid reason to keep peer-reviewed research from the public. To be clear, by 'peer review,' I mean scientific review and not a political filter.","The reality is if something were to happen that cost China jobs - like, if they upwardly revalued the currency a lot - those jobs aren't going to come back to the U.S. They would go to Vietnam; they would go to Thailand. They would go to whatever country was the lowest cost.","The way we'll get more jobs is by creating new industries, new companies, businesses that are higher tech and therefore can compete.","The United States is the least protectionist country in the world but has the largest trade deficit, while other countries are highly protectionist and have huge trade surpluses. This cannot continue.","If you add up all the promises any politicians makes, the math doesn't work.","My obligation is to disclose companies in which I'm an officer, a director, or an investor.","A company not under sanction is just like any other company, period.","Enforcement is a very important part of the administration strategy. We think that even our friendly nations should live by the rules, and if they don't, we will intend to enforce things against them.","We'll be aggressive on trade because we know that deals that have been made historically have resulted in the great loss of manufacturing jobs, a great amount of closed manufacturing businesses. We don't want that to continue.","Mexico has 44 treaties with other countries that make it very advantageous to do international shipping from Mexico rather than from the United States.","There's trade, there's sensible trade, and there's dumb trade.","I believe if we and the Mexicans make a very sensible trade agreement, the Mexican peso will recover quite a lot.","If people know you have the big bazooka, you probably don't have to use it.","There are deep value opportunities in insurance stocks, which were beaten down because of their exposure to the subprime crisis, annuities, and commercial real estate.","I still like TIPS (Treasury inflation-protected securities), and I think a big opportunity is coming in the municipal bond market.","I think partly the decline in the peso was due to worry about renegotiation of NAFTA, but I think we also need to think about some other mechanisms for making the peso/dollar exchange rate a bit more stable.","If trade deficits are good, why is China so pleased that they run a huge trade surplus? It's perfectly obvious that if China hadn't been such a huge net-exporter, it never would have grown at the rate that it did.","The E.U. is one of our largest trading partners, and any negotiations legally must be conducted at the E.U. level and not with individual nations."],"Wilbur Smith":["Quite frankly, I think political correctness is the worst form of censorship. You're not allowed to speak your mind unless you're black, or unless you're a terrorist, or unless you're an Arab or a minority people. Then you can say what you like. But if you are like a lot of us you are not supposed to say certain things.","At the age of 12 I won the school prize for Best English Essay. The prize was a copy of Somerset Maugham's 'Introduction To Modern English And American Literature.' To this day I keep it on the shelf between my collection of Forester's works and the little urn that contains my mother's ashes.","I wanted to be a great white hunter, a prospector for gold, or a slave trader. But then, when I was eight, my parents sent me to a boarding school in South Africa. It was the equivalent of a British public school with cold showers, beatings and rotten food. But what it also had was a library full of books.","My father was my god. His approval was so valuable to me.","I love the sea as much as I love the veldt of Africa.","I think one of the most poignant things is unrequited love and loneliness.","I'm not a prophet; I can only use historical reality to come to a view of the future, and my view is that Africa will return to being African and not European. The advent of colonialism was foreign to the country itself, but it will return to what it was before the Europeans arrived.","I'm not a good father and they're not children any more; the eldest is in his fifties. My relationship with their mothers broke down and, because of what the law was, they went with their mothers and were imbued with their mothers' morality in life and they were not my people any more.","I've eaten lion, leopard, crocodile, python. I don't recommend lion. It tastes exactly like when a tomcat comes into your house and sprays. Snake and crocodile are great - a cross between lobster and chicken.","As regards to personal safety, you do have to be careful not to put yourself at risk when travelling in South Africa. You don't want to go out exploring at night, for example.","The really disturbing thing about Somalia is that in a country where there are few economic opportunities, pirates are perceived as glamorous and are held in awe by young boys who aspire to their lifestyle.","What I like about writing is the sense of godlike power it gives you.","I don't know how many lions and leopards I've shot. I've shot two elephants, which was enough - never again. It's a melancholy and moving thing to hunt an elephant. It's like shooting an old man.","My mother-in-law speaks not a word of English. I speak not a word of Tajiki. So I smile at her ingratiatingly and she fixes me with a beady eye.","My mama loved books; I became fascinated by the wonderful stories that came out of these things she held in her hand - and started to make them up myself.","Despite the fact that I spend a lot of time in London, Switzerland and New York, Africa is the place I know and love best, and my heart will always lie here.","The mistake the apartheid government made was they gave the black people nothing, so they had nothing to lose. But now a lot of the former freedom-fighters are big-time capitalists. They've been given directorships in every major company. They're billionaires!","I live in Cape Town but my favourite holiday destination is Hermanus, a little seaside town about a 90-minute drive away, over the pass and down to the sea, on the sunshine coast. It's where I love to escape to with my wife for a weekend every now and again.","For the past few years my fans have made it very clear that they would like to read my novels and revisit my family of characters faster than I can write them. For them, I am willing to make a change to my working methods so the stories in my head can reach the page more frequently.","The first story I ever sold was to 'Argosy' magazine, which no longer exists. That issue also contained work by several other more celebrated writers, like Ray Bradbury - so I felt I had at least one toe on the ladder.","I never set out to write literature; I set out to tell stories. And some of my work may be very raunchy and very bloodthirsty - but life, for me, is a violent thing.","My first novel was rejected by some of the most eminent publishers in the world. Starting again was a real wrench.","I have never had too much trouble for creative ideas to spring up in my mind.","They say I'm worth either €200 million, €100 million, €50 million or €10 million, but that's something between God, the HMRC and myself.","I'm not perfect and I know it. I've done all sorts of things that are frowned upon these days - big-game hunting, fishing. I still enjoy fishing but I don't kill warm-blooded animals any more - I make an exception with birds sometimes.","I've been associated with Macmillan for over 45 years. I'd like to thank them for their continued commitment to my backlist and I look forward to continuing to work with them as they publish my next novel, 'Vicious Circle' in 2013.","My family wasn't terribly affluent and looked upon money very carefully as something that had to be saved, not spent. My father built the ducting that took air into the copper mines and made about 6 d a yard in the Thirties, which was good money back then.","I shot my first lion at the age of 14 when a pride threatened my father's livestock while he was away on holiday.","I think money is essential to happiness and right now I wouldn't want to be anyone other than Wilbur Smith - I've had a fantastic life, rewarded far more heavily than I deserve. Maybe I'd like to be J. K. Rowling, but I'll settle for second best.","There is no quick way of making money. People come to you with tips for the races or offer the latest Ponzi scheme, but I can see them coming a mile off. I just go with the adage that if it sounds too good to be true it probably is.","This first print run of the first edition of my first novel, 'When The Lion Feeds.' back in 1964, is so rare it can fetch several thousand pounds at auction. I always wanted to be an author, and I decided to write about what I knew.","It's probably true that everyone has a book in them, although it may not be a very good one.","Herbert, my father, was born in Britain but went out to Africa in his teens to join his father and built up an 18,000-acre ranch in what was then Northern Rhodesia, providing work for the locals. He was my hero when I was a boy.","My absolute favorite pieces are 'Rhapsody in Blue' and 'Begin the Beguine.' I play these when I am working.","Usually halfway through a book I have a serious depression, so I go on safari on my ranch in South Africa, or fishing off my island in the Seychelles. When I come back and re-read it, I think: 'What was all that about, Smith? It's fine, just get on with it.'","They say if you drink Zambezi water with your mother's milk, you are always a slave of Africa, and I am.","Cape Town's beaches are superb and while the water on the Atlantic side is damn cold, it's very pleasant on the other side. Bring your golf clubs if you play - Cape Town has some fabulous golf courses.","The whole structure of African government, as far back as we know, was based on tyranny. One guy ran the show. Chiefs like Chaka and Mzilikazi committed terrible atrocities. That is the tradition from which modern African rulers spring. It won't change easily overnight.","There's nothing so aphrodisiacal for a woman as money and success.","Many people have compared me to the Victorian adventure writer, Rider Haggard. I accept that as a compliment. As a boy growing up in Central Africa I read all Haggard's African novels.","I have been blessed in many ways, and one of those is to have been born in Africa, for me a great treasure house of stories. I have been researching it since my infancy; reading about it, talking to men and women who have spent their lives in this land, living it as I have and loving it as I do. I write almost entirely from my own experience.","Literature throws us many great heroes. Real life invariably outdoes them.","I work on my novels wherever I have a PC, and I have four or five places around the world where I do have a PC. These days you can just slip a little flash drive into your top pocket, fly for 12 hours, come to another place, plug it into a computer and you are away again.","I write my books in my head, and not in a specific study with a view. The view is from my inner eyes.","You know that feeling when you finish a final exam and you think, 'I never want to do that again'? Well I have the same feeling when I finish a novel. Each time I say, 'I think I may retire now' and then after six months the ideas start to churn again. I could never stop.","I read all of Rider Haggard's books. For me he had the romance of Africa with a little bit of mysticism. I'm delighted to be looked on as his heir and be categorised as an adventure novelist because that's exactly what I am.","Write for yourself, not for a perceived audience. If you do, you'll mostly fall flat on your face, because it's impossible to judge what people want. And you have to read. That's how you learn what is good writing and what is bad. Then the main thing is application. It's hard work.","To me, my characters are more real than most people I meet.","I am a closet birdwatcher. I can identify Southern African species, but it irks me I can barely tell a jay from a blackbird in the U.K.","There are people out there with an eye on my hard-earned cash who think that I am a pushover. I am not!","When I vacate this sack of old bones I won't care what you do with it. Bury or burn it but don't make much fuss.","Real men read my books.","I used to own an island in the Seychelles and had a big boat there and one day I came across some Somali pirates who were passing by on their way to re-provision their boat. They didn't even acknowledge me - which is unheard of among sailors - and it was like looking into the eyes of a black mamba.","I'm a feminist. The women in my books in recent years have been powerful characters and I love to see a woman with a cute bottom walking past.","Politicians all over the world cater to domestic vote banks. They will spend only on what their constituents want. So unless there is a grass root green movement in a nation the politicians will not be willing to spend money on curbing emissions. More awareness is needed amongst the people to effect the real change in how governments spend.","Authors can only soft sell the environment. Create a wonderful story around the environment involving the characters that leaves a lasting impression on the reader's mind.","People don't really know themselves until they're 30. Like most people nowadays, I went to university, got a degree and wandered for a bit. I trained to be a chartered accountant, which I didn't much enjoy, and it was only slowly that the idea of becoming a creative writer gelled.","The first novel I wrote was a monster - clocking in at 180,000 words - but it died a death, a death it deserved. It was called 'The Gods First Make Mad.' It was a good title, but it was the only good thing about the book. I didn't let that put me off.","I put my soul into every book I write.","I still get enormous pleasure and a sense of fulfillment out of writing a book that I'm proud of. I see myself as a bit like a jewel-maker who can sit back and admire his work.","All my characters have got a big slice of me in them. A big piece of me, because it's my dialogue and this is the way I think and talk.","I want to be seen as a good storyteller. I'm a manipulator as well.","I hate politics. I like to write about it, but to get involved in it, to try and make a lot of ignorant people do what you want them to do, waste of time. Go and write a book. It's more important and it'll last longer.","I believe that a healthy body breeds a healthy mind. I am 74 years old now and my wife, Niso, is 38 years younger than me. She absolutely insists that I take regular exercise with her.","Every time one of my books sells a million copies in paperback, Pan Macmillan gives me a gold statuette of Pan. I have about 20 of them.","I have done everything I have ever wanted to do. I have swum with tiger sharks, been charged by lions and elephants. I have been shot three times, chased by crocodiles and, God be praised, I've made enough money that I can continue to do all the things I want to for as long as I am able.","I don't want children. Why should I let some strange little monster into my life to destroy what to me is a perfect set-up?","You don't turn out as many books as I did then by sitting around, being cozy with the family.","I grew up in Rhodesia on my father's ranch and every year he used to take us on safari in some remote area of the wilderness.","I go on a hunting safari at least once a year to Botswana, which is fantastic because we have a huge area of wilderness entirely to ourselves. My island covers roughly 55 acres, which again I have to myself, with nearly half a kilometre of private beach with my own jetties and boats.","I read a lot of biographies and books with an African background.","I know it's politically incorrect but I enjoy things like the kick boxing and cock fighting."],"Wilbur Wright":["It is possible to fly without motors, but not without knowledge and skill.","I confess that in 1901 I said to my brother Orville that man would not fly for fifty years.","The desire to fly is an idea handed down to us by our ancestors who... looked enviously on the birds soaring freely through space... on the infinite highway of the air.","Men become wise just as they become rich, more by what they save than by what they receive.","The fact that the great scientist believed in flying machines was the one thing that encouraged us to begin our studies.","I am an enthusiast, but not a crank in the sense that I have some pet theories as to the proper construction of a flying machine. I wish to avail myself of all that is already known and then, if possible, add my mite to help on the future worker who will attain final success.","We could hardly wait to get up in the morning."],"Wild Bill Hickok":["My dearly beloved if I am to die today and never see the sweet face of you I want you to know that I am no great man and am lucky to have such a woman as you.","I have never insulted man or woman in my life, but if you knew what a wholesome regard I have for damn liars and rascals, they would be liable to keep out of my way.","I have quit chewing tobacco and don't touch any lager beer, and I don't speak to the girls at all. I am getting to be a perfect hermit; my fiddle, my dog, and my gun I almost worship.","Agnes Darling, if such should be we never meet again, while firing my last shot, I will gently breathe the name of my wife - Agnes - and with wishes even for my enemies I will make the plunge and try to swim to the other shore.","I never, in all my life, took any mean advantage of an enemy.","Harness mules and oxen, but give a horse a chance to run.","When the war closed, I buried the hatchet, and I won't fight now unless I'm put upon.","I know my Agnes and only live to love her.","I don't like to talk about that McCanles affair. It gives me a queer shiver whenever I think of it, and sometimes I dream about it and wake up in a cold sweat.","How to get over the river was the bother. At last, after thinking a heap about it, I came to the conclusion that I always did: that the boldest plan is the best and safest.","I have a mother back there in Illinois who is old and feeble. I haven't seen her this many a year and haven't been a good son to her, yet I love her better than anything in this life.","This circus that's advertised to show and furnish a little amusement for us heathens is owned by a woman, one whose pluck catches my sympathy every time.","There has been two awful fights in town this week. You don't know anything about such fighting at home as I speak of; this is no place for women and children, yet, although they all say it is so quiet here... if a man fights in Kansas and gets whipped, he never says anything more about it. If he does, he will get whipped for his trouble.","If I've got any authority in Hays, Mrs. Lake isn't going to pay this town a cent of license for showing, and if any man attempts to stop this show, then just put it down that he's got me to fight."],"Wiley Wiggins":["I'm ready to deal with somebody else's baggage. I'm sick of mine.","If I had a job pitching for the Giants, I probably wouldn't be manning my own Twitter account.","My pitching in 'Dazed and Confused' was so bad that they had to use cut-ins with a stunt double, and I spent most of that filming night being ruthlessly mocked by a team of Little League extras."],"Wilford Brimley":["I live on a ranch in Utah for now, but I'm gonna move. I've got another ranch to move to, but its location is a secret.

Modern science can acknowledge no other than this epistemological stand-point.","If we conceive all the changes in the physical world as reducible to the motion of atoms, motions generated by means of the fixed nuclear forces of those atoms, the whole of the world could thus be known by means of the natural sciences.","Ancient metaphysics underwent many changes at the hands of medieval thinkers who brought it in line with the dominant religious and theological movements of their day.","A knowledge of the forces that rule society, of the causes that have produced its upheavals, and of society's resources for promoting healthy progress has become of vital concern to our civilization.","Any theory intended to describe and analyze socio-historical reality cannot restrict itself to the human spirit and disregard the totality of human nature.","From the perspective of mere representation, the external world always remains only a phenomenon.","However, the sciences of society and of history retained their old subservient relation to metaphysics for a long time - well into the eighteenth century.","On the other hand, for the whole human being who wills, feels, and represents, external reality is given simultaneously and with as much certitude as his own self.","The existence of inherent limits of experience in no way settles the question about the subordination of facts of the human world to our knowledge of matter.","The individual always realizes only one of the possibilities in its development, which could always have taken a different turning whenever it has to make an important decision.","The knife of historical relativism... which has cut to pieces all metaphysics and religion must also bring about healing.","The lived experiences which could not find adequate scientific expression in the substance doctrine of rational psychology were now validated in light of new and better methods.","The sciences which take socio-historical reality as their subject matter are seeking, more intensively than ever before, their systematic relations to one another and to their foundation.","Thus, in accordance with the spirit of the Historical School, knowledge of the principles of the human world falls within that world itself, and the human sciences form an independent system."],"Wilhelm Frick":["As far as the charge against me is concerned I have a clear conscience.","By the fulfillment of my legal and moral duty I think I have earned punishment just as little as the tens of thousands of dutiful German officials who have now been imprisoned only because they carried out their duties.","My whole life was service to people and the Fatherland."],"Wilhelm Keitel":["If I had known it I would have told my son, I'd rather shoot you than let you join the SS.

they deal with the facts of life at large, and in particular with the facts of human life.","From the standpoint of observation, then, we must regard it as a highly probable hypothesis that the beginnings of the mental life date from as far back as the beginnings of life at large.","Hence, wherever we meet with vital phenomena that present the two aspects, physical and psychical there naturally arises a question as to the relations in which these aspects stand to each other.","Hence, even in the domain of natural science the aid of the experimental method becomes indispensable whenever the problem set is the analysis of transient and impermanent phenomena, and not merely the observation of persistent and relatively constant objects.","Philosophical reflection could not leave the relation of mind and spirit in the obscurity which had satisfied the needs of the naive consciousness.","Physiological psychology is, therefore, first of all psychology.","Child psychology and animal psychology are of relatively slight importance, as compared with the sciences which deal with the corresponding physiological problems of ontogeny and phylogeny.","The results of ethnic psychology constitute, at the same time, our chief source of information regarding the general psychology of the complex mental processes.","In Aristotle the mind, regarded as the principle of life, divides into nutrition, sensation, and faculty of thought, corresponding to the inner most important stages in the succession of vital phenomena.","In the animal world, on the other hand, the process of evolution is characterised by the progressive discrimination of the animal and vegetative functions, and a consequent differentiation of these two great provinces into their separate departments.","Now, there are a very large number of bodily movements, having their source in our nervous system, that do not possess the character of conscious actions.","On the other hand, ethnic psychology must always come to the assistance of individual psychology, when the developmental forms of the complex mental processes are in question.","Physiology seeks to derive the processes in our own nervous system from general physical forces, without considering whether these processes are or are not accompanied by processes of consciousness.","The general statement that the mental faculties are class concepts, belonging to descriptive psychology, relieves us of the necessity of discussing them and their significance at the present stage of our inquiry.","The materialistic point of view in psychology can claim, at best, only the value of an heuristic hypothesis."],"Wilhelm von Humboldt":["True enjoyment comes from activity of the mind and exercise of the body;

Certainly one of the perks of doing an animated film is that you don't have to go and get ready and wear wardrobe, and you just show up in whatever you're wearing.","The voice for 'Surly' is, of course, very close to my own voice, but it's informed a lot by this story, by the arc and the animation and working with the whole creative team on 'The Nut Job' in finding what really works."],"Will C. Barnes":["'Mustanging' was like trout fishing. It is always the big ones that get away. When you did get a bunch of them into a corral, you found they did not look half so large and handsome as when they were first sighted on the prairie.","Every author believes that the book which he is placing before the public will 'fill a long-felt want,' and success or failure depends very much on how closely he has been able to gauge the nature of the 'long-felt want.'","Man's greed to obtain something for nothing has never yet been able to content itself with a moderate profit.","Once, no self-respecting puncher considered himself dressed for work until he had his feet inside of a pair of $15 boots made by one of the favorite boot-makers, whose merits they discussed about the camp fires night after night."],"Will Carleton":["Over all our happy country - over all our Nation spread, Is a band of noble heroes - is our Army of the Dead.","Worm or beetle - drought or tempest - on a farmer's land may fall, Each is loaded full o' ruin, but a mortgage beats 'em all.","But I have learned a thing or two; I know as sure as fate, when we lock up our lives for wealth, the gold key comes too late.","I've watched my duty, straight an' true, an' tried to do it well; Part of the time kept heaven in view, An' part steered clear of hell.","If there's a heaven upon the earth, a fellow knows it when He's been away from home a week, and then gets back again.","Things at home are crossways, and Betsy and I are out.","To appreciate heaven well, it's good for a person to have some fifteen minutes of hell."],"Will Carling":["Success in management and success in sport are derived from the same basic principles.","This work is the result of a meeting of minds from two of the most successful men in their respective fields.","People have to understand how important it is for the players to let off steam, switch off and relax.","People complain professional sportsmen are locked away but when they get out and enjoy themselves, people have a go.","I certainly look at the modern guys and think they are a different species to when we played. They are fitter and their conditioning is extraordinary."],"Will Champion":["Optimism is the key.","I think hopefully we've got enough brain cells left to decide if our music is really worth something.","The first time we all played as a band, I think it was in January 1998, in Jonny's bedroom.","Two weeks later, we played our first concert and had 100 people there. It was pretty cool.","Coldplay are just four friends trying to make great music.","At the end of the day, we're just trying to prevent each other from going mad.","A lot of the time there is a lot of melancholy in the lyrics.","We're also passionate about music and very critical about the music that we listen to.","When you write something it has to hit the level that you accept as being good.","I can't do all that riddly diddly stuff. I'm not good enough. It's all about not playing."],"Will Champlin":["I chose 'The Voice' because I knew they had a lot more respect for each artist, as opposed to the other shows. They don't get it. I don't think those shows ever got it. I was turned off by some of the other shows and how they did things.","I'm very hands-on with my own music.","I've seen a lot of my friends go through different reality shows, and they just get caught up in a lot of stagnant positions, unfortunately.","I'm definitely a fighter, like Christina Aguilera would say.","Competition is all in numbers; it's a numbers game, but I looked at it like it's a passion, and it's art.","Own every note I sing and sell it. Make a connection to the audience. That's what it comes down to, you know?","It's liberating and rewarding to see your own ideas coming to fruition.","Being yourself is the most important element for me, because, if you're trying to be something you're not, the audience will pick up on that.","I just wanted to keep consistent and keep true to America and not seem contrived. I didn't want to seem contrived at all with any song choice that might be a detriment to my journey on 'The Voice.'"],"Will Chase":["In acting, you have to know that you are worth something. I knew I had some talent somewhere.","Over the years, I've had to learn to play. For example, when 'Lennon' was on Broadway, I learned my way around the guitar chords because originally we were all going to play the instruments without a band.","I would say that I don't look for musical things.","The thing I like about 'Nashville,' it just happens to be about musicians, and all the music is practical, meaning it's performed at a concert or during a rehearsal.","It might be odd for people to hear this, but honestly, you know, when you're on stage, I don't think people realize how grueling eight shows a week is. And as far as jobs go, being a Broadway actor, it's hard. It's fun, but it's hard.","I play enough guitar to get by. I don't like to play guitar live.","I would love to do a political drama. I'm a 'West Wing' fanatic.","I played more performances of 'Chris' in 'Miss Saigon' than anyone else.","I loved being on stage with heroes of mine, like Gregg Edelman and Jimmy Walton, and the lovely Chita Rivera and Stephanie J. Block.","'Miss Saigon' taught me what it means to help carry a big show, and it had some of the most gorgeous songs wrote.","Flops are always disappointing, but 'High Fidelity' was devastating. Not that I thought it was going to make me a big star, but I did think it was going to run longer than a week and a half.","I don't read reviews until after I'm done with a production, but when I do finally get to them, I'm always sort of floored by what the bad ones say.","'Story of My Life' was essentially a two-man musical play. In hindsight, I don't know if there was room for a two-man musical on Broadway.","Being exposed to the diversity of music I was as a kid made me the actor I am today. As an actor, you have to adapt and do so many different things.","Look at Greg Jbara! I've watched him work for years, always switching. He's literally a different human being when he's onstage in 'Billy Elliot.' That's the fun of what we do."],"Will Cotton":["People's love of sweets and guilty feelings about overindulgence are pretty universal.","In a gallery, there's an expectation of high prices and a somewhat elitist atmosphere.","Smells are so powerful and evocative, sometimes stronger than visual cues.","When I first started painting candyland imagery, I was looking for the best possible metaphor for everything that is pleasure, desire and insatiability.","The goal of art-making in general is communication.","As an artist, it's possible to get tired of yourself.","In terms of the class structure that you see so much in European portraiture, I don't think one feels that in America in the 21st century. But we have these other kinds of social structures now, like celebrity, who establish new hierarchies.","There's something of a painting of a woman that represents all women - and by extension, all of humanity - that I just find very exciting. It's a nice distillation, I think, of what it means to be alive."],"Will Cuppy":["Etiquette means behaving yourself a little better than is absolutely essential.","The Dodo never had a chance. He seems to have been invented for the sole purpose of becoming extinct and that was all he was good for.","Aristotle was famous for knowing everything. He taught that the brain exists merely to cool the blood and is not involved in the process of thinking. This is true only of certain persons.","The trouble with the dictionary is that you have to know how a word is spelled before you can look it up to see how it is spelled.","Some people lose all respect for the lion unless he devours them instantly. There is no pleasing some people.","I don't like to boast, but I have probably skipped more poetry than any other person of my age and weight in this country.","Just when you're beginning to think pretty well of people, you run across somebody who puts sugar on sliced tomatoes.","Caesar might have married Cleopatra, but he had a wife at home. There's always something.","If an animal does something, we call it instinct; if we do the same thing for the same reason, we call it intelligence.","It's easy to see the faults in people I know; it's hardest to see the good. Especially when the good isn't there.","If a cat does something, we call it instinct; if we do the same thing, for the same reason, we call it intelligence."],"Will Durant":["We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.","Civilization begins with order, grows with liberty and dies with chaos.","Knowledge is the eye of desire and can become the pilot of the soul.","Civilization exists by geological consent, subject to change without notice.","When liberty becomes license, dictatorship is near.","The political machine triumphs because it is a united minority acting against a divided majority.","Our knowledge is a receding mirage in an expanding desert of ignorance.","Education is a progressive discovery of our own ignorance.","It may be true that you can't fool all the people all the time, but you can fool enough of them to rule a large country.","History is mostly guessing; the rest is prejudice.","To say nothing, especially when speaking, is half the art of diplomacy.","To speak ill of others is a dishonest way of praising ourselves. Nothing is often a good thing to say, and always a clever thing to say.","The love we have in our youth is superficial compared to the love that an old man has for his old wife.","Tired mothers find that spanking takes less time than reasoning and penetrates sooner to the seat of the memory.","The family is the nucleus of civilization.","We are living in the excesses of freedom. Just take a look at 42nd Street and Broadway.","Education is the transmission of civilization.","Inquiry is fatal to certainty.","There is nothing in socialism that a little age or a little money will not cure.","Nature has never read the Declaration of Independence. It continues to make us unequal.","Truth always originates in a minority of one, and every custom begins as a broken precedent.","The trouble with most people is that they think with their hopes or fears or wishes rather than with their minds.","We Americans are the best informed people on earth as to the events of the last twenty-four hours; we are the not the best informed as the events of the last sixty centuries.","In my youth I stressed freedom, and in my old age I stress order. I have made the great discovery that liberty is a product of order.","Science gives us knowledge, but only philosophy can give us wisdom.","If man asks for many laws it is only because he is sure that his neighbor needs them; privately he is an unphilosophical anarchist, and thinks laws in his own case superfluous.","Woe to him who teaches men faster than they can learn.","The most interesting thing in the world is another human being who wonders, suffers and raises the questions that have bothered him to the last day of his life, knowing he will never get the answers.","Every science begins as philosophy and ends as art.","Moral codes adjust themselves to environmental conditions.","Every form of government tends to perish by excess of its basic principle.","The ego is willing but the machine cannot go on. It's the last thing a man will admit, that his mind ages.","One of the lessons of history is that nothing is often a good thing to do and always a clever thing to say.","I am not against hasty marriages, where a mutual flame is fanned by an adequate income.","Sixty years ago I knew everything; now I know nothing; education is a progressive discovery of our own ignorance.","As soon as liberty is complete it dies in anarchy.","A statesman cannot afford to be a moralist.","There have been only 268 of the past 3,421 years free of war.","Man became free when he recognized that he was subject to law.","Civilization is the order and freedom is promoting cultural activity.","Bankers know that history is inflationary and that money is the last thing a wise man will hoard.","Most of us spend too much time on the last twenty-four hours and too little on the last six thousand years.","Every vice was once a virtue, and may become respectable again, just as hatred becomes respectable in wartime."],"Will Durst":["Comedy is defiance. It's a snort of contempt in the face of fear and anxiety. And it's the laughter that allows hope to creep back on the inhale.","I'm glad Reagan is president. Of course, I'm a professional comedian.","How did sex come to be thought of as dirty in the first place? God must have been a Republican.","I hate the outdoors. To me the outdoors is where the car is.","There is humor in the specter of the worst disaster in our nation's history. All I have to do is sweep away the debris of shock to find it.","Men are superior to women, for one thing they can urinate from a speeding car.","It's okay to laugh in the bedroom so long as you don't point.","Well, we won the war. You know what that means. In twenty years, we'll all be driving Iraqi cars."],"Will Eisner":["A key to my thinking has always been the almost fanatical belief that what I was engaged in was a literary art form. That belief was compounded out of ego and necessity, I guess, a combination of the two.","Humor has historically been tied to the mores of the day. The Yellow Kid was predicated on what people thought was funny about the immigrant Irish. When you're different in a society, you're funny.","I want to point out to adults that there is a world of good material available to you now in comic form - in this medium - and learn to give it your support because the more you support it, the better the material will be as it comes out."],"Will Estes":["I'm into all that sappy stuff - a surprise picnic, nice dinner, or traveling. I'm kind of an old romantic.","My dogs are a priority and a big responsibility... but the payoffs are well worth it.","I think education is one of the greatest tools for most kids not only to expand their book knowledge, but their ability to experience new things - I think it opens more doors than any other experience I can think of.","A lot of directors are great and they are fine but you know I think that Harry really takes a special point to really engage the actors and really make it feel like a safe place for them to explore whatever it is they want to explore in whatever scene with their character.","But, on another level it's really sort of this really cool coming of age story, it reminds me of like The Breakfast Club or something like that, if I can be so bold to associate with The Breakfast Club.","For me, one I love the 80's, I love 80's music, I'm sort of a baby of the 80's, I grew up in the 80s.","I don't really get a chance to watch much television. I mostly watch BBC Worldwide and repeats of Seinfeld and Everybody Loves Raymond.","I guess growing up I realized that there is really this huge epidemic in a city like Los Angeles, and many other cities, where they put down thousands upon thousands of animals every day.","I had a director who told me a story about a fan who had commented on how nice it was to see her sister laughing and how happy the show made her. I like to make people happy and make them laugh.","I love the music, I love the times, so to me that was exciting personally just to play something that starts in 1986 with graduating high school, we've got a great soundtrack in the pilot.","I loved doing sitcoms.","I've always been an animal lover. I've grown up with dogs my whole life. I think that is what helped me get the role on 'Lassie', I was comfortable around the dog, where many of the kids were afraid or intimidated by Lassie.","It's drama, it's a lot of things, but you know it's always about every movie or every TV project ever made is meant to be watched. If people like it and support it, that's what it is all about, really it's sort of the important part about it.","It's real time intensive so there's not much time for goofing around, but we are really close and we have a good time with each other. It's a great group.","That's a tough question; I've been acting since I was 10. My dad was an entrepreneur, so I guess something along those lines. I wouldn't want a 9-5 job.","You get to actually see the music video on the TV in the pilot and we have the soundtrack playing at this big party. I thought that was sort of a cool moment, to actually have the A-Ha video is pretty cool.","You know how most dogs lick you on the cheek? If you're sleeping and not ready for it, my dog, Joe, will get his tongue inside your mouth. It's by far the worst kiss I've ever had.","I've been acting since I was 10. My dad was an entrepreneur, so I guess something along those lines. I wouldn't want a 9-5 job.","I'd say you have to be really committed to the field, show up for every audition and to be aware that very few make it in this field.","I'd love to learn to cook. I think the ladies like a guy who can cook. Also, there are lots of available ladies at cooking classes. Can you tell I'm single?","I wish I knew at 14 not to put much thought into what other people my age said to me, cause we were all looking for the answers. So I wish I knew that other people really don't know any more than you do!"],"Will Ferrell":["When I was a kid, 'Land of the Lost' was my favorite show, just because it was - in the landscape of Saturday morning cartoons - it was so unique. It was a live-action show and kids were in it, these creatures, these Sleestaks and dinosaurs. Every week was a different adventure. I couldn't wait. I loved it so much.","I don't know about living on an automatic pilot, but I've had times where I've decided to just test myself and my mettle, and for no good reason other than it's what life is. Even before I was acting, I had, like, one day in high school I decided to just show them my pajamas, just for no good reason.","I've always wanted to sail around the world in a handmade boat, and I built a boat.","A lot of people have gotten into comedy because of certain influences in their lives or events that were painful, and I really have wracked my brain to figure it out. I pretty much have had a normal childhood. Maybe it was too normal.","Saturday Night Live is such a comedy boot camp in a way, because you get to work with so many different people who come in to host the show and you get thrown into so many situations and learn how to think on your feet, so filmmaking actually feels slow, in a good way.","If you are going to wrestle a bear, try to stay away from all fish oil products, you know. I mean it's tough for me, because I love to rub myself with salmon oil every day - it's a great conditioner for the hair, skin.","It's very easy for me to play silly, but to reveal something closer to you, that's so much harder.","I'd love to become like Bill Murray, who was so funny on 'Saturday Night Live' and has gone on to do some of the landmark comedies people like. And then to add this whole other phase to his career with 'Lost in Translation' and 'Rushmore.' I always felt to be able to have something similar to that would be great.","The funny guy doesn't get the girl until later in life. High school, college, everyone still wants the brooding, dangerous guy you shouldn't have.","I was a strange kid in that, while most kids hate school and want to turn 18 or 21, I loved high school.","I've never had a yard sale, ever, in my life. I don't know if I ever thought about stuff I would get rid of.","I know the nature of comedy, and you never know what will happen with the next movie or whether people will find it funny.","I left 'Saturday Night Live' without a film to go to, and I'd filmed 'Old School' while I was in my last season of the show, and that hadn't come out yet. I was a free agent, in a way, but I knew it was time to leave the show and test the water.","I'm a bit of a gourmet chef. I love cooking - mostly Thai food.","My kind of wanting to be funny didn't come from need, necessarily. The closest I can analyze it is that it was an easy way to make friends, I found out. It was just a great kind of social tool.","I've got no dark secrets, I wasn't beaten up, my parents were kind to me and there was a low crime rate where we lived. Maybe that's where the comedy comes from, as some sort of reaction to the safe, boring suburbs.","I think anyone who has, you know, is in any sort of artistic pursuit, kind of goes up and down with the way they feel about their work. And I, for the most part, am pretty happy person. But, yeah. I go through definite periods of time where I'm not funny. I'm not good. I'm - I don't feel original.","Molly Shannon and I used to always talk about that we really felt strongly that we were comedic actors, that we weren't comedians. You just played things real and the comedy came out of the context.","I've never been a conceited person or cocky, never felt boastful, but I always had a sense of self-worth; I always had a real sense of myself.","Oftentimes, even as a little kid, I would get up before anyone else. My brother would still be sleeping, my mom would still be sleeping, so I would literally play 'Monopoly' by myself. I would play board games; I would do things by myself.","There's always going to be someone as funny as you or funnier.","I'm a Cancer; I'm music-passionate. I like long walks on the beach.","I was never a class clown or anything like that, but I do remember being in the first grade and my teacher, Mr. Chad, told the class one day that we were going to do some exercises. He meant math exercises, but I stood up and started doing jumping jacks. To this day, I don't know what possessed me to do that, but all my friends cracked up.","Anyone who does anything creative is always gonna want to change.","Aren't we all striving to be overpaid for what we do?","I guess ultimately a lot of comedians just wanna be taken seriously.","I'm a Progressive. Much in the same way our founding fathers - who, oddly enough, wouldn't get elected today - were Progressives.","When I was ten, I wrote an essay on what I would be when I grew up and said I would be a professional soccer player and a comedian in off season.","In junior high P.E., I was way too shy to take a shower in front of the other kids. It was a horribly awkward time - body hair, odors... So I'd go from my sweaty shirt back into my regular clothes and have to continue the day.","I live by 'Earnin' and burnin'.' Meaning, I like to make money and spend it before I even have it. That's the way I live my life.","All you have in comedy, in general, is just going with your instincts. You can only hope that other people think that what you think is funny is funny. I don't have an answer but I just try to plough straight ahead.","I left home to go to college, and then I moved back home. I moved back for three years from 21 to 24.","Enjoy the little fun things - like taking your kids to school - before they're all grown up.","You tend to get reluctant to talk about anything until the day before filming.","I'm the minority in my house sometimes. My wife is Swedish, and we go to Sweden and everyone is rattling off in Swedish. It's like, 'OK, I can just read a book.'","I love playing the macho guy who looks like an idiot.","When I first started doing sketch comedy, I promised myself that if I were ever to have any success in this business, I wouldn't hold back. Why get there and play it safe?","I'm a selective pack rat. There's some things I have no problem getting rid of and others I hold onto dearly.","There's nothing sexy about Orange County.","I grew up in an entertainment family, and so I saw how susceptible you are to the ups and downs of this business.","I have only been funny about seventy four per cent of the time. Yes I think that is right. Seventy-four per cent of the time.","Inappropriate behavior makes me laugh.","I think a lot of the instincts you have doing comedy are really the same for doing drama, in that it's essentially about listening. The way I approach comedy, is you have to commit to everything as if it's a dramatic role, meaning you play it straight.","James Caan told me at the end of filming 'Elf' that he had been waiting through the whole film for me to be funny - and I never was.","Often times I'm confronted with a quote that I don't remember saying. So, on one hand it's very flattering, it is just so surreal.","I always find it actually funny that the analysis is that the characters I play in comedies are the manchild, the adolescent, characters that refuse to grow up. And yet, if you look back in the history of comedy all the way back to the Marx brothers, that's a big part of comedy.","Members of the Senate and House, if they want to send troops into war, should be forced to send a family member. That would really make everyone stop and go, 'Ohhh-kaaay.'","I did plenty of jobs that I hated. I was a bank teller and terrible at it. I parked cars, a valet. I answered phones. I somehow avoided being a waiter. I knew I wouldn't be able to keep the order straight. I'm not much of a multi-tasker.","In the fourth grade, I learned how to fake walking into a door. You know, you hit it with your hand and snap your head back. The girls loved it.","By the time I was ready for college, I didn't know what I wanted to do. I think I secretly wanted a show business career, but I was suppressing it.","I've always loved watching the news on TV. As a kid, I loved watching Walter Cronkite, for some reason.","'Elf' has become this big holiday movie, and I remember running around the streets of New York in tights saying, 'This could be the last movie I ever make,' and I could never have predicted that it'd become such a popular film.","My dad turned me onto Peter Sellers as a kid. I loved the fact that he was a unique combination of being extremely subtle and over-the-top all at the same time, and that's a hard thing to do. I admire that.","When you hear that you're going to be working with a first-time director, sometimes that can be a concern to people.","One of my first memories of being a kid was, 'I want to have a real job when I grow up.' And to me that meant you wear a suit and a hat and carry a briefcase and go to your job.","I still regret that I never played soccer in high school. I chose basketball over soccer.","I will watch a movie that is quote unquote dark and not get the qualification of what is dark and what is not.","I've always had, when I needed it, an extreme amount of focus that I could put into something. That has served me well.","I don't really have aspirations to be Tom Hanks.","I hate when someone drives my car and resets all the radio presets. I don't understand it. If I was ever driving someone's car, I would never touch the things that were set.","For people who have done comedy after a certain point in time, I think there's a base level of, 'O.K., I think I'm decently funny.' But unless you just have some massive ego, I really think you're still fighting against that.","You still have that competitive thing where you want to try to make hits. That won't go away, unless the mayor of show business says my time's up.","I think with the success of, like, every summer there has been a couple R-rated comedies that have done so well; I think it is so nice to see that people are turning out to see these movies, and it doesn't seem to be as big a stigma with the studios anymore.","I remember going with my mom to a random garage sale as a kid and thinking what a cool treasure hunt that whole world was. Only to transition as an adult to think, 'What a gross place that really is.'","I think 'SNL' was such a unique thing because it was material you created and you're very comfortable with it, even though the setting was pressure-packed.","When a dramatic actor does a funny film, people are like, 'Wonderful! I didn't know he was funny!' But when it flips, people can get really thrown by it.","I've had moments in my life when I've thought if I wasn't acting, if I wasn't doing what I do and I had a career in the private sector and I didn't have a family, that I do have some tendencies where I could really kind of have a monastic existence and be okay with it.","I would love to play Simon Cowell in a movie - heck, I would love it. It would be my dream role.","I speak as much Spanish as anyone who has grown up in Southern California or Texas or Arizona. I had my three years of high-school Spanish and a couple of semesters in college.","When you're doing an out-and-out comedy, the notion of preparing for a character - I hope I don't reveal too much of myself here - but, uh, no, I'm not doing anything.","I might be more fluent in Swedish than I am in Spanish. My wife speaks it to our kids, and they're fluent so I hear it all the time, so I've got that under my belt.","Happens I am very political. I have deep political instincts.","When you look at someone like Sacha Baron Cohen, you have to really respect the boundaries he is pushing as Bruno or Borat.","There are a lot of really funny guys who are very natural in what they do: Jonah Hill, Michael Cera, Seth Rogen.","I always just forced myself to do crazy things in public. In college I would push an overhead projector across campus with my pants just low enough to show my butt. Then my friend would incite the crowd to be like, 'Look at that idiot!' That's how I got over being shy.","It's tough for me to get rid of clothes. I grew up in a household with a limited budget and we really had to make our nice clothes last, and so now I'll get free pairs of shoes and this, that and the other and I'll be like, 'Oh great!'; even though it stresses me out that I don't have enough room to put them, I can't throw them away.","It'd be great to be in a position where you can make choices regardless of money. My tastes are always gonna lead me to go for the amazing project where I'm being paid in Turkish cantaloupes."],"Will Forte":["I'm kind of under the radar. Not a lot of people notice me. Which is surprising, because I'm so sexy. They're probably intimidated by my sexiness and crushability.","You can do anything to my food and I'll still eat it.","It takes a certain type of person to register your 'Donkey Kong' score. So I'm just number 29 in registered Donkey Kong scores.","My life is littered with bad decisions.","I don't know if I was a funny kid. I would say I was a loud and weird kid.","I feel like all my faults go into making the person that I am. I like myself as a person. And I think taking any fault away would change who I am as a person.","I'm not very good at impersonations."],"Will Friedle":["You have to contort your body in a certain way to hit a low note. When you're on film, you can't. So you do, in a sense, get to hide behind your voice, which is nice.","We all got lucky doing Boy Meets World.","It's fun to see a lot of the crowd become embarrassed. You're kind of watching them almost wanting to not watch the screen, but they have to because it's so compelling!","I'm such a video game fan that being able to do voices in video games is just fantastic.","I'm one of those guys that never get embarrassed.","I'll do anything to get the laugh. I love it.","I'd like to do voiceovers my whole life. I get to kind of create a character and go in and play.","I want to go out there and do the best work I can.","I want to be in this business as long as this business will have me.","I had the honor and privilege of working with John Ritter.","I don't think, until the end, I had read a positive review of Boy Meets World.","Getting to meet people that I've admired my entire life, and getting to meet them in such a way where they're coming in to play completely different characters than I had ever seen them do is just wonderful.","Especially in the last 10 years, the writing on animated shows has jumped by leaps and bounds.","Bad reviews come with everything. I've been getting them my whole life.","All the directors that I've had the opportunity to work with are fantastic."],"Will Gluck":["When you have a movie about people landing from planet Neptune, you suspend disbelief. I totally get it. But I like doing things that happen in real life.","I don't like having characters as props. I never want a character to be a prop.","I like to deconstruct things, deconstruct genres and stories.","I like doing character movies. I like doing movies about personal situations; that's what I love about dealing with things.","I like doing movies about personal situations; that's what I love about dealing with things. I don't like superhero things, I like real-people things.","I try not to read the Internet because it's mostly just a sea of hatred."],"Will Harvey":["I've never seen a monument erected to a pessimist.","What is research but a blind date with knowledge?","Retiring is just practicing up to be dead. That doesn't take any practice.","Ever occur to you why some of us can be this much concerned with animals suffering? Because government is not. Why not? Animals don't vote.","If 'pro' is the opposite of 'con' what is the opposite of 'progress'?","In times like these, it is helpful to remember that there have always been times like these.","If there is a 50-50 chance that something can go wrong, then 9 times out of ten it will.","Like what you do, if you don't like it, do something else.","Every pessimist who ever lived has been buried in an unmarked grave. Tomorrow has always been better than today, and it always will be.","Golf is a game in which you yell 'Fore!', shoot six, and write down five."],"Will Hermes":["'Rhye' clearly plays with notions of sexual identity, and it has made a concerted effort to keep its own identity mysterious. Its love songs are gender-neutral, the members have declined to appear in their own videos, and you'd be hard-pressed to find a photo of the duo that doesn't cast them in shadows.","Comeback records always worry me, especially when they're made by one of my heroes, and I'd heard stories about Gil Scott-Heron recently, about drug arrests and prison terms and other troubles. I wasn't prepared for the ravaged shakiness of his voice on this record or the raw spoken word pieces or the dark electronic backgrounds.","When I discovered Gil Scott-Heron, I discovered a musical hero, a man who spoke baritone truth to power over jazzy funk at a time when funky music was primarily about shake, shake, shaking your booty.","What's the difference between male and female passion? If love is a drug, what are its side effects? Rhye makes chill-out music, but it never quite lets your mind switch off.","Adele Adkins' retro-soul debut, '19', was striking less for her songs than for that voice: a voluptuous, slightly parched alto that swooped and fluttered like a Dusty Springfield student trying to upstage her teacher, or at least update the rules.","Whether the issue was black political power or nuclear power, Scott-Heron didn't mince words. His comeback record, 'I'm New Here,' doesn't mince words either, but instead of political battles, these songs suggest he's fighting personal ones.","The upshot here is that Gil Scott-Heron is still a warrior, even if the front lines have moved. He's made a record not without hope but which doesn't come with any easy or comforting answers. In that way, the man is clearly still committed to speaking the truth."],"Will Hobbs":["'Changes in Latitudes' began when I was looking at a photograph of a sea turtle swimming underwater. I had such a strong feeling for the beauty of this ancient creature, at home in the sea. On the spot, I wanted to swim with that turtle. I began to imagine a character who would do just that.","Choosing the narrator for a first-person story like 'Downriver' is a crucial decision because the voice has to be one the reader wants to listen to, and the voice has to be a match for the emotion you want the story to carry.","For 'The Big Wander,' I probably had ten different outlines before I made myself start writing. I would sleep on each one, thinking it was wonderful, but I would always awake perceiving some flaw.","I was astounded to learn that Alaskan caves might be hiding secrets about the earliest people ever to enter the Americas. That's when I began to picture a story that would start with kayaking and lead into the caves.","I love weird science. I learned in an article in 'National Geographic' that there are trillions of bacteria in our guts that help us digest food. These are non-human creatures.","In a lot of cases, writers discover that the novel needs to begin later in the action than they'd first thought.","Seven of my novels take place in the Southwest, in the Four Corners area which has been my home since 1973. I know these mountains, rivers, mesas and canyons well, so it's been natural for me to draw on my own personal experiences here.","Researching and writing about the Klondike Gold Rush of 1897-98 was one of the most exciting and involving projects I've undertaken.","I do have two wonderful awards from the Western Writers of America, one for 'Beardance' and the other for 'Far North.' The award is called the Spur, and the plaques really do have spurs on them!","'Ghost Canoe' takes place on the storm-tossed tip of Washington's Olympic Peninsula, where I spent a lot of time hiking and exploring.","I've been under the spell of the North ever since my childhood in Alaska. More and more, I've been returning to Alaska, and sometimes my adventures inspire a story.","I've been collecting articles on extremophile bacteria for at least the last ten years. I find them fascinating, whether they live in boiling pools at Yellowstone, around thermal vents at the floors of the oceans, or on Mars, where NASA has been searching for them as the first evidence of life beyond Earth.","I've been reading about Crazy Horse and Custer for a long, long time, and I thought that if I was going to write a story that took place in the Black Hills, I should find a way to include this history in it.","My youngest brother and I went on a ten-day canoe trip in Bowron Provincial Park in British Columbia years ago. Believe it or not, we took only granola, thinking we'd be eating a lot of lake trout. Well, we neglected to bring along a net, and our fishing line was only 8-lb. test.","I love to read about the exploits of technical mountain climbers, but I've never done any vertical climbing.","My first job out of college was six weeks of picking fruit alongside a dozen or so men from Mexico. The orchard was in Emmett, Idaho. The men spent almost nothing on themselves. Their paychecks went directly to their families back home.","My seventeen years of teaching inform my sense of audience in every line I write.","Pacing has become more important than ever, largely because of other media. I've always tried to start my stories out with a bang, something that will hook their attention."],"Will McCormack":["A career in film didn't seem like something I could attain. Whereas I grew up next to New York City, and I spent my life going into New York City seeing plays, and I was a theater actor in school. Acting on the stage felt really natural to me, and I liked it, and I wasn't terrible at it.","I knew I'd never have the career Colin Farrell had. I was working in stuff that was, for me, not very challenging. My career wasn't going as well as I wanted it to. So I turned to writing because I felt like I had more to say, and I started writing every day.","Instead of waiting around for someone to give you a job, you have to go and create work for yourself. It took me a while to figure that out for myself.","All love stories rest on the leads, and if they work, the show works, and if they don't, the show won't work, no matter how good the writing is.","I'm friends with most of my exes because I'm sort of proud of my ex list. I've dated some really great girls.","It's really intense to write and make a movie and produce it and have it come out in the world. It's a very vulnerable thing.","There's more pressure as a writer. As an actor you usually just go, do your job, and go home."],"Will McDonough":["Muhammad Ali is a combination of personality and athlete who is probably better known around the world than any other. He became a great hero.","I think the greatest all-around athlete ever was Jim Brown. He played lacrosse, basketball and ran track at Syracuse. He played professional football for the Browns.","I think money in general hurts all sports.","I think almost every newspaper in the United States has lost circulation due to the Internet. I also think the Internet will lead to a lot of plagiarism in journalism.","The future is electronic. It's radio, television and the Internet; it's not really newspapers anymore.","When I started at the Globe 40 years ago, there were seven newspapers in Boston and now there are only two. There were only three or four television stations in Boston and now there are a dozen.","There aren't enough good journalists. There are too many who really weren't groomed to be reporters and, as a result, some of the reporting is shallow.","The wonderful thing about television is the immediate impact of pictures of current events.","The two major things that changed the makeup of all professional sports are money generated by television and courts that players went to in order to win their freedom as free agents.","The one good thing about television is the money; you can make a lot more money than in newspapers.","The ability of players to jump teams when their contracts are up has hurt fan loyalty.","Pete Rozelle used television to get the game to the American public by creating the Super Bowl and making it the biggest sporting event in the world.","Overall, I think Michael Jordan is the greatest athlete in any particular sport. He dominated the game for the Chicago Bulls and brought the NBA to its greatest peak of popularity.","One of my first jobs was at the Boston Globe. I worked in the sports department six months a year. When I was ready to graduate, the sports editor gave me a job as a schoolboy sports writer.","I've been very fortunate to be involved in all the Super Bowls, to see some World Series, to cover heavyweight championship fights; I've been to the Olympics and seen every sporting event there is.","I was fortunate to be part of a very successful show on CBS in 1986. I switched to NBC for eight years and through these experiences have gotten terrific insight into television; it's a fascinating medium.","I think we'll always have newspapers, but they'll lose influence.","I received $100 per week when I started working at the Globe after graduation.","I predict that many teams will go out of business and the size of the leagues will be greatly reduced.","I don't think we use television the way we should or the way the inventors intended.","I don't think there is enough educational programming, but unfortunately, television is built around advertising and those shows don't get the big ratings.","I don't think the players play with the same desire they once did."],"Will McIntosh":["I wrote a novel about an economic/environmental collapse titled 'Soft Apocalypse,' and that's definitely the sort I'm best prepared for. To write the novel, I did a lot of reading on what we might expect, so at the first sign, I'm ready to convert all of my assets to gold and ammo and stock up on freeze-dried food.","I'm a lapsed Zen Buddhist. I've read hundreds of books on Zen, I meditated daily for about fifteen years, and once spent a month studying with Vietnamese Zen monk Thich Nhat Hanh.","As a kid, I fell in love with the 'Creature from the Black Lagoon.' I don't know why. I liked the werewolf, Gamera, The Hulk, but I loved the Creature.","My personal belief is that attraction to SF/F is coded right into your genes. I was attracted to monsters and robots as far back as I can remember."],"Will Oldham":["I figure it's okay to make certain rules, whether or not people despise you for it at the time.","I have more respect for somebody who points at his ideal - in this case, the ideal of the pirate - and then becomes something that's more radical, more exciting, more subversive than a pirate could ever be.","It's O.K. to accept good fortune.","I'd like my records to reach as many people as possible, but I'm also thinking in terms of how I can keep from getting jaded or unhappy with the process.","It's nice to be able to backtrack and not be embarrassed by the music you used to listen to.","I need to go someplace faraway that doesn't have telephones and doesn't have a record player and doesn't have movie theaters and people walking down the street in order to not do anything.","I don't think that word - the word pirate - has any real meaning. Or it's something that's had meaning imposed on it.","There's very little admirable about being a pirate. There's very little functional about a pirate. There's very little real about a pirate.","I think that America in general is piratical. Every time we accept a paycheck for doing almost nothing, allowing us to live above the poverty line, we're engaging in piracy.","It is more rewarding to be complicit with scarcity than excess.","I really hate press.","Sometimes we need to tell ourselves that we're not going to do certain things, just in order to stay sane.","I like rural areas.","I don't like going to cities. I don't mind maybe being in a city sometimes for a few hours, but I pretty much don't like cities. I don't even like passing through them.","I think everybody works from a defensive position, for the most part, in the film industry.","I write a song to be recorded. And to some extent to be performed, but definitely more to be recorded than performed, because the recording will last longer than a performance.","I do not want a personal relationship with my fans. Or to do anything that encourages them to think they have one with me. They can have a personal relationship with my songs. That's fine, but they don't know me.","Too much emphasis is put on American roots music when people try and place me. You know, I grew up listening to punk.","People are looking for fame or a focus, and I can't provide that.","I make the songs and part of making them is singing them. But what you hear is not me. It's the song. It's through me.","Writing songs is a profession; so it's not an attempt to take things from my interactions with other people and for some reason give them to a total stranger to listen to. I find it offensive to hear other people do that.","As it turns out, as an adult I can have a very unpleasant, fierce and unforgiving temper at times. But I don't think I had that when I was a kid.","What is normally called religion is what I would tend to call music - participating in music, listening to music, making records and singing.","I think records and music are more appropriate and more respectful of the human soul than the churches are. And more respectful of the needs of humans to communicate with the aspects of themselves that are neglected by language.","I don't like the idea of being surrounded by hidden things; people you can't see in buildings and cars.","Cities are made for enemies to destroy.","Whenever I see something that looks like it could be good - whether it's on vinyl, CD or cassette - if it's not too expensive, I'll take a chance.","I think that what trips up a lot of great musicians is that they become involved with too many things that aren't where their strengths lie.","When I was a kid, I always thought that acting was going to be the way to go."],"Will Packer":["I really feel like the sky is the limit. I'm a dreamer, and I dream in full vivid color HD.","When you come into the industry as an outsider, you need to have an entrepreneurial spirit to succeed. In Hollywood, it's very clear that you either play by the rules or make up your own. And I wanted to do it my way.","When people have options for what they want to see, it forces the quality of programming and content to be higher.","People that I know, the vast majority, who are successful work really, really hard. Sure, there's some people that either get lucky or inherited it or don't have to work hard for some reason, but the vast majority who are successful work really, really hard.","I definitely want make an impact in television. I want to make a continued and greater impact in feature films, and I want to be somebody who continues to be at the forefront of creating a wide variety of content that I could be proud of and that engages people on all levels.","When I was a kid, my parents never let me use race as an excuse. They'd say, 'When you walk into a room and it's all white, those kids have to work to stand out, not you.'","There's nothing more important than having a personal connection with your audience.","I'm always going to go up against movies with bigger muscle and money, so I need to have a strong grass-roots game.","I had no intention of being a film producer, and I knew I wasn't passionate about engineering. I was always set on having my own business, controlling my own destiny.","We need more filmmakers of color telling the story. I'd like to see more filmmakers take their products out independently, put together a good commercial film and distribute it online.","I'm excited about my own network, BounceTV. It's the first African-American-owned broadcast network. It's myself, my partner Rob Hardy, and some other African-American businessmen, including Andrew Young and Martin Luther King III."],"Will Patton":["I've dealt with a lot of guns over my career, so I'm getting better and better with firearms.","I don't want to play fat cops for the rest of my life.","I love things where I can be physical and I so love high stakes, and you usually don't get that unless you're doing a play or an action movie.","I can't play anything until I find something that connects to my life, something I can carry as my secret map or code for the character.","In a way I feel completely frightened of dealing with other human beings at all, yet here I am sticking my face in front of a movie camera all the time."],"Will Poulter":["I think for anybody, regardless of what industry you work in, when you get a new job, and it's progressive in terms of your career, that is one of the best feelings in the world.","My brother's my best friend, without a doubt. Me and my big sister get along so well. She moved to East London, though, so points off, but she's wicked. And then my little sister is a little genius. She's super talented and such a great person, always been far more mature and cool than me.","How often do I call my mom? You can never call your mum enough, and I should call my mum more often. But I speak to my mum very regularly and have a close relationship with my parents.","I'm fortunate enough to have had an opportunity to do a range of stuff, and the thing I admire most in actors is versatility, those that morph and change, those kind of chameleon actors who are unrecognisable from one job to another. That's something that I aspire to establish myself.","I would love to do some motion capture work just to be able to challenge myself.","I've not really been let down by anyone I've admired and then worked with.","I love fashion. I shop like a 16-year old girl. Sneakers. That's what I spend money I don't have on.","As much as I would love to do roles in big movies and am keen to establish myself in the industry. I don't want to sacrifice things that I really enjoy, like spending time with my family and friends.","The will to challenge myself is strong, but I think that's growing, the desire to stretch myself and make it hard.","My problem is I'm not talented enough to do everything, but I want to do everything. I'm like, 'Oh God, I wish I could dance! Oh God, I wish I could rap!' I can't be a rapper, and I'm sure as hell not going to be able to dance for a living, but I want to do it all, you know?","I always wanted to play a 'Batman' villain; that was a big one for me. I may have missed the boat, but I always wanted to do that.","I'll just say it: I'm not the sharpest tool in the box. Being forced to go back to school is still a fear of mine.","I didn't want to be behind a desk. I didn't want to do a normal job. I had made my mind up. I became despondent prematurely. I had my mid-life crisis when I was 16. I suppose I'd agree with that. But acting has helped me develop a lot in my private life.","Themes of redemption, temptation, and faith don't necessarily apply directly to religion. A lot of people find faith in their lives outside of God and still deal with notions of temptation and redemption that aren't religious.","Seeing the actual 'The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe', I absolutely loved it. It became one of my favourite films. It was a real Christmas classic, and it was one of the most popular films ever in British history.","I joined the after-school club, School of Comedy, which progressed wildly, and in quite a Hollywood way. It sounds like 'School of Rock', right up to trying to raise money to pay for a venue in Edinburgh.","My teacher told my mum, 'I think William has dyspraxia,' and Mum asked what that meant. She said, 'Well, if I put a chair in the middle of the room and asked every child in the class to walk around it, William would be the only child in the class to walk into it.' Mum was like, 'Yeah, that's my boy'.","Somehow I got a place at Bristol University. I'm still waiting for the phone call to say that they made a mistake and got the wrong person.","The thing I get a lot is, 'You've got a very recognisable face.' I'm never quite sure what to make of it.","I absolutely love Leonardo DiCaprio.","I need to try and get away from that brat role, or people are going to think I'm a natural brat.","I think what makes Narnia a magical place is that it offers escapism - escapism from a world that is so different from the reality known by the characters and the reality known by the fans.","I am the biggest Kanye and Jay Z fan.","I am the black sheep of my family. They are all super talented and intelligent and got proper jobs. Most of my family is in medicine, actually. They are all too clever to be doing what I do.","Kissing scenes are never romantic or sexy. They're actually super technical, like, 'Move your head; you're blocking her light,' or, 'Stop looking like an idiot when you kiss her.'","I hate going into the audition room. I find it the most nerve-wracking, inhumane experience, and I think it's such an inhospitable environment to give an honest account of the character and, I guess, your ability.","I have a relationship with New Line, so I'm grateful to them for taking a punt on me - both for 'We're The Millers' and 'It'.","Working with people like Jennifer Aniston and Jason Sudeikis is such a blessing because I've watched them a great deal. I grew up with 'Friends' and always aspired to work with someone from that cast. Jason is just such an amazing comedian.","High school was interesting. For the most part, I quite enjoyed it. But everyone is trying to find their footing, and school can be a tough environment. Kids can be cruel to each other. It's quite unforgiving at times.","I wasn't good at anything at school, and acting was the only thing that I really loved doing and was interested in. It was kind of like my only option. For me to get opportunities in acting is so fortunate. I found something I loved doing and wasn't terrible at; it was quite nice.","I look up to Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon. I'm a huge fan of their work. I also like actors who really transform themselves, like Joaquin Phoenix. And I loved Robin Williams growing up. He does comedy and drama so brilliantly.","I think we have a responsibility to shape the zeitgeist with the movies we put out there. Because 'After Earth' isn't going to do it. 'The Expendables 3' isn't going to do it. You could make one million amazing films for the amount of money they spend on those films. I get frustrated.","There's no other industry in the world where you could spend $100m as frivolously as they do in the film industry. Think about how much good you could do with $100m... it can be spent in 20 minutes on a movie.","There's such a thing, if you're a finance man, as hitting the figures you need to hit. But there's no equivalent in acting. It's a creative field. It's subjective. That's what I love about it.","I feel like there's a dangerous culture among young actors of going to posey joints and socialising - not doing hard work. I don't want to go and hang out in Soho House L.A. That's literally my worst nightmare. I'd rather be at home reading scripts.","I feel really blessed that I found what I love doing and was able to make it a living from such a young age. I realize that I'm really fortunate. I didn't train; I kind of got lucky. And I remember that every day. I think I have to remind myself of that to really, fully appreciate life now.","I hate the school of thought that says work is work and that you have to be unhappy at work because that's what work is. I totally respect the fact that not everyone has the choices that I have, and that some people have to work jobs that they don't like because they don't have any other options.","The Internet unfortunately means that, although a lot of truth and good stuff can spread as a result of the Internet, I think bad stuff and negativity spreads even more quickly.","It was incredibly daunting for me to go from 'Son Of Rambow' to 'Narnia' because of the natural jump that there is that is dictated by budget, and the number of people working on it. Even though a lot more people saw 'Son Of Rambow' than we expected, a lot more people were always going to go and see 'Narnia'.","I've always found that I have to audition, but that's a process that I kind of enjoy. I enjoy the challenge, and 'We're The Millers' was the same. It was a long audition process that I had to go through, but I enjoyed the challenge of that.","I first read 'The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe' when I was a kid. And I think it was read to me. Me and my sister both had a copy and loved the books.","I'd never read 'Prince Caspian'. I watched it and loved that film. Everybody was talking about its lack of success; its relative success in comparison to the other film. It's a great film. It deserved to do a lot better than it did. It's very difficult to make a film that will match up to the first.","Al Pacino never looks like he's being filmed.","I love food. I think arguably the thing I'm best at in life is eating food, which is not the best talent in the world, but it's a talent.","I love the camaraderie that develops on film sets and ensemble casts. It's really special.","I am very much a city boy, and I really don't get out into the countryside or the wilderness that much at all.","One of the challenges obviously with doing an accent from a time period early in history is that there aren't recordings. You would never really get the opportunity to hear exactly what you were shooting for.","I come from this bubble in life - I come from a great family and went to a nice school, and I have friends, and life is pretty rosy.","Drama is what I'm really obsessed by. It's what gets me up in the morning, what I live for. But I'll always have a love for comedy because it was my first opportunity, and I associate it with my best friends, who I made during 'School of Comedy'.","Everyone in New York wants to move to London, and everyone in London wants to live in New York. A few people want to live in L.A., but I'll never understand that. It's too much for me.","Anyone who supports your work, I like having the opportunity to thank them for that, and I think also Twitter provides an opportunity for people in the public eye to give a faithful account of who they are.","I think the one thing that I've experienced with American films is just that the size tends to be so much bigger, the budgets have been bigger, the size of the sets have been bigger, the number of people working on them is bigger, but that's not to say that I haven't been able to get close to people or develop good relationships.","I fully accepted that I cannot grow facial hair, but it is quite emasculating.","I actually found 'We're the Millers' one of the toughest, if I'm honest, least fun experiences of my life, which is weird. It was such a huge opportunity for me to work with the people I worked with and I feel grateful to be a part of that, but it kind of messed me up.","Sometimes I've been more emotionally disturbed by the experience of shooting a comedy than a drama. After 'We're the Millers', I think playing this battered loser who's confidence was at zero for 90 percent of the movie, I did genuinely feel that way.","I think it reaffirmed something that I believed in and conceptually always had faith in which was that you're most effective when you work as a team. I love that about filmmaking. I stopped playing team sports at 15-16 because of acting. I think I find a kind of new team sport in filmmaking in a way.","I am not a fan of tarantulas.","I wasn't picked for any of the sports teams at school because I was half the size of everyone else, but now everyone assumes I must have been some sort of rugby player.","It may sound strange to say it of someone so famous, but I think Leonardo DiCaprio is underrated, particularly from an awards perspective. He is a very versatile actor. He started very young, and 'What's Eating Gilbert Grape?' is one of my favourite films.","I haven't skied or snowboarded or anything like that.","I don't think Tom Hardy has an actual voice of his own. Except maybe the one in 'The Dark Knight Rises,' as Bane.","For one thing, there is no guarantee that I am even going to work again. I hope I will and will go on to have a long career.","I feel character description from a book can mislead you and actually make you fall off course when you're representing a character using a script.","I remember power-sliding on my knees the first time I got a job.","I just like the prospect of playing lots of different types of characters and just the opportunity to challenge yourself, do something different and surprise people.","I don't really want to play Will Poulter for the rest of my life, because that's boring.","It's difficult to tell whether people are looking at you because they recognise you from your work or just because you're 6 ft. 3 in. and have the eyebrows of Satan. It's difficult to distinguish between the two.","What's hilarious is people taking photos and they think you don't know. It's the funniest thing I've ever seen. Like taking a picture of their mate for example but about three foot wide of their face - and the flash is on half the time!","If I could be something other than an actor, I'd be a chef; I've got a big interest in food. I'm a proper fan boy.","Leonardo DiCaprio I find very inspiring... He's my idol. I absolutely love Leonardo DiCaprio. Christian Bale, obviously, being a British actor and going from 'Empire of the Sun.' Now he's Batman.","I'd like to go to university. I'd like to do a bit of travelling.","If I tried to do comedy for the rest of my career, I would not be very successful.","I was lucky that I had friends who have maintained a very regular attitude with me and haven't changed how they interact with me.","I have got some fantastic friendships that I have had for a long, long time.","Cara Delevingne and I took an eyebrow selfie. We both have prominent eyebrows, but hers are much better than mine. Maybe we should do a swap.","This is a business, and no one enters a race not to finish first. I wouldn't say I'm in it for the competition, but I'm certainly not just in it to coast along. I want to be the best I possibly can be.","I think I'm slightly OCD. I'll be desperate to get a part, but as soon as I do, the sense of pride wears off almost immediately, and fear of not doing a good job sets in. I'll think, 'This is a dream come true,' and then, 'It's not OK until I get a good review.'","I just felt that I might to go to university and get some real life. It wasn't stimulating in the same way. I loved being at Bristol, but I missed the thrill of being on set.","Confidence is the greatest gift for an actor.","The transitional period is tough. You can find yourself too old to play high school roles but too young to play the leading man. You have to be quite smart about how you present yourself.

That's really what I hope I am remembered for the most.","I would love to do a good gritty drama, a romantic role. I tend to play bad guys for some reason.","What's the fun in approaching something closed-minded? I'm very specific; if dialogue is too on-the-nose, or there's a lot of telling and not showing, I'll talk to my manager and let them know the problems I have with it. But, I always go in with fresh eyes.

My dad loves really solid, old school, Broadway musicals, and one of them is 'Assassins' by Stephen Sondheim. All of the successful or non-successful assassins that have ever existed in the United States come together, and they talk about their killing or attempts through songs."],"Will Self":["You don't need to know this - but here goes: due to some acquired infantilism, I feel compelled to fall asleep listening to the radio. On a good night, I'll push the frail barque of my psyche off into the waters of Lethe accompanied by the midnight newsreader - on a bad one, it's the shipping forecast.","The paradox of modernism is, writers make the decision to work with the continuous present, and to work with... stream of consciousness, as it's called, for emotional reasons, and the main emotional reason is verisimilitude. I mean, this is what surprises people: Life is not in the simple past.","Modernism has a reputation for being a forbidding phenomenon: its visual arts disconcertingly non-representational, its literary efforts devoid of the consolations of plot and character - even its films, it's argued, fall well short of that true desideratum: entertainment.","Always carry a notebook. And I mean always. The short-term memory only retains information for three minutes; unless it is committed to paper you can lose an idea for ever.","The life of the professional writer - like that of any freelance, whether she be a plumber or a podiatrist - is predicated on willpower. Without it there simply wouldn't be any remuneration, period.","I like texting as much as the next kidult - and embrace it as yet more evidence, along with email, that we live now in the post-aural age, when an unsolicited phone call is, thankfully, becoming more and more understood to be an unspeakable social solecism, tantamount to an impertinent invasion of privacy.","Death, the real simile for disease - for when we are ill, do we not always feel like we are dying, even if it's only a little? - remains, despite our secularism, the most metaphoricised phenomenon of all.","Sometimes, when I hear people without experience of addiction blame addicts for their behaviour, I feel like saying to them: 'You simply don't understand - how can a child be held responsible for doing such a dreadful thing to himself?' But then again, at other times I have to acknowledge: it was done wilfully.","With spectacular events taking up so much of the available anxiety quotient, we need to be constantly reminded of the more workaday threats to our mortality - threats that, while they may also be functions of human error, have become so ubiquitous that we've begun to apprehend them as natural phenomena.","When anyone starts out to do something creative - especially if it seems a little unusual - they seek approval, often from those least inclined to give it. But a creative life cannot be sustained by approval, any more than it can be destroyed by criticism - you learn this as you go on.","I am a regular, if not exactly enthusiastic, patron of my local bookshop. I try to buy at least some books there because I cling to the belief that it's important to maintain those businesses which put a human face on the exchange of money for goods and services.","Lives don't divide up into chapters. People don't just talk, while nothing's going on in their head, and then respond. You know, none of these things actually happen.","A short story is a shard, a sliver, a vignette. It's a biopsy on the human condition but it doesn't have this capacity to think autonomously for itself.","To attempt to write seriously is always, I feel, to fail - the disjunction between my beautifully sonorous, accurate and painfully affecting mental content, and the leaden, halting sentences on the page always seems a dreadful falling short.","Who'd want to be a modernist writer in the English-speaking world?","In our benighted age, when films about amusement park rides and electronic fidgets scoop the honours, perhaps Hollywood redux is the best we can hope for.","I'd rather fiddle with my phone for precious seconds than neglect an apostrophe; I'd rather insert a word laboriously keyed out than resort to predictive texting for a - acceptable to some - synonym.","A party full of 'likeable' people doesn't bear contemplating.","One of the most heartening phenomena in today's Britain is the great diversity of the modern nerd - the nerd is out and proud, and while she may love 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' merchandise more than is strictly warranted, she is in every way to be cherished as an exemplar of cosmopolitanism and tolerance.","Certainly, for time out of mind, an obsessive dwelling on happier former days has been synonymous with getting older, while it was the juvenescent who rushed with open arms to embrace the future.","Of course, with well-masticated food playing the role of social glue, it's absolutely essential that everyone clear their plate. Sod the starving kiddies in Africa - it's the overfed ones here we need to worry about.","So heedless have we become of our own image that second-hand mobile phones now invariably come with a SIM card chock-full of discarded intimacies.","Whatever respect photography may once have deserved is now superfluous in view of its own superfluity.","What more chilling indictment of the modern world is there than this: that the condition of the smartphone user is that of a dumb animal. Moooo!","A very beautiful young woman once asked me to sign her breasts. That was back when I was a hip young thing - it's been all downhill since then.","This is the paradox for me: in failure alone is there any possibility of success. I don't think I'm alone in this - nor do I think it's an attitude that only prevails among people whose work is obviously 'creative'.","Political activists of all stripes are usually a wacky bunch, and never more so than in a system like Britain's, where power is effected via the quiescence of the electorate as much as its convictions.","It could be argued that every age gets the comfort savagery writer it deserves.","As for critical writing about modernism, its moments of lucidity are but fulgurations illuminating the dark and incomprehensible landscape of its subject's unabashed difficulty.","As a bookish adolescent, I sopped up texts as if I were blotting paper and they were fluid.","I'm English enough to feel something of a gut-reaction to modernism, to continental philosophising and anything that smacks of a refusal to pay attention to the forensics: the empirical facts on the ground.","For myself, I haven't been content to carry on producing books that merely strain against the conventions - as I've grown older, and realised that there aren't that many books left for me to write, so I've become determined that they should be the fictive equivalent of ripping the damn corset off altogether and chucking it on the fire.","That tertiary education is under a sustained assault by a political and - it often seems - social consensus that equates all education with training for increased productivity, only makes academe a still more promising environment for a contrarian.","There is something mysteriously powerful that can happen when young, inchoate minds come into contact with older and more worldly ones in a spirit of intellectual and creative endeavour - if I believed in progress, I suppose that's what I'd call it.","I don't think in terms of that bizarre tautology 'value for money' in my literary and journalistic work - and nor will I in my academic role. However, if I don't believe I'm helping my students towards a fuller and more empowering relationship with the world, then I'll resign.","Without a shadow of doubt, Trafalgar Square has to be one of the most crap urban public spaces in the world.","From time to time, as if heaven-sent to annoy, someone will ask me if I'm self-disciplined when it comes to my work. I usually look witheringly at them and snarl, 'What do you think?' I mean, how do you imagine anyone writes a quarter of a million words a year for publication?","The high arts of literature and music stand in a curious relationship to one another, at once securely comfortable and deeply uneasy - rather like a long-term marriage.","What the British seem to like are television historians and naturalists, not public intellectuals. You can't help feeling that's because one supplies narrative and the other supplies facts, and the British are traditionally empiricists so they/we have a resistance to theory and to theoreticians playing too prominent a role in public life.","There's a flip side to having prominent public intellectuals, which is that they start meddling in politics and often with quite disastrous results.","To purposely concoct older characters of a sunny disposition would be as much of a solecism as deliberately fabricating arrhythmic blacks, spendthrift Jews, slacker Japanese and so on.","Just as the blurring between childhood and adulthood has produced the kidult, so the stretching of middle into old age has fostered another peculiar chimera: septuagenarians with apoptosis sporting the depeche mode.","Sometimes it occurs to me that the job of a serious cultural critic mostly consists in telling the generality of people that their opinions - on films, on books, on all manner of widgets, gadgets and even the latest electronic fidgets - simply aren't up to scratch.","Life, it is true, can be grasped in all its confused futility merely by opening one's eyes and sitting passively, a spectator on the stands of history - but to understand the social processes and conflicts, the interplay between individual and group, even the physicality of human experience, we have need of small-scale models.","As the render is to the building, and the blueprint to the machine, so sport is to social existence.","It is fair to say that insofar as sport is taken seriously by those who play it, then to that extent their conduct in play - their ability to deal with loss or victory, their ability to meld strategic thinking and brute force - can be taken as a small-scale model of how they, or others like them, might behave in life.","It is not that sport, over-indulged in, coarsens the mind; it is that it dulls it.","If we bought everything on the Internet, our eyes and mouths and nostrils would probably begin to film over with a tegument - one initially tissue-thin and capable of being removed each morning, but which gradually thickened and hardened until we were imprisoned in our own tiny minds.","Live life and write about life. Of the making of many books there is indeed no end, but there are more than enough books about books.","The writing life is essentially one of solitary confinement - if you can't deal with this, you needn't apply.","I always wanted to write fiction. Always. As far back as I can remember it's been integral to my sense of myself - everything else was always a displacement activity.","The only proper suit-and-tie job I've had in my life was the two years in the late 1980s when I ran a small corporate publishing company. I even had a Ford Sierra!","I do have a fantasy life in which I can grout bathrooms - but not for a living.","It might be an idea for all literary critics to read the books they analyse aloud - it certainly helps to fix them in the mind, while providing a readymade seminar with your audience.","As a writer, I'm not convinced that we are the best equipped to understand how we go about the business of literary production.","The novelist, quite rightly, fears the psychoanalyst as both an enemy and a usurper.","In truth, even if they have an imperfect insight into their own methods, I still slightly mistrust writers of fiction who are assured literary critics; it makes me suspect that they favour the word over the world it should describe. Such scribes fall victim too easily to the solecism of equating style with morality.","What fiction offers us is an intimacy shorn of the messy contingencies of human existence - gender, race, class or age. Those moments of transcendence when we exclaim 'You know exactly what I mean!' depend for much of their force on the anonymous character of the intimacy between writer and reader.","I've said it before - and I'll say it again: it always seems to me that we come to know our same-sex parents through the bodily and the involuntary; through a kind of fossicking of our own physical strata. As we come to resemble our fathers, so we re-encounter the individual who reared us.","My novels tend to come about from a fusion of two big ideas, creating a critical mass that then fissions, throwing off hundreds of other particles, riffs, tropes and characters.","Many of my works fall into the category of 'Zeitgeist novels'. Yet I hope that they aren't only reportage, but also attempts to convey the sense of the present to the future.","Some people have human muses - mine is a city. I feel a startling ambivalence towards London, but for better or worse my work has come utterly to depend upon it.","I loathe computers more and more, so I have one I can shut down and shelve like a book.","I can't throw anything away. Anything. I'm going to end up like one of those old weirdos who lives in a network of tunnels burrowed through trash - yet I do not fear this.","Most of us have had that experience - at around puberty - of realising that, despite whatever efforts we put into our chosen sports, we will become at best competent.","If the government announced that it was going to allocate a vast tranche of education funding purely to the pupils at the best public schools, there would be a national outcry - and yet this is precisely what the Olympics represents in terms of sports funding.","In my view, the plangent artificiality of a lot of creative work results from the fact that the people who write novels, direct films and put on plays tend to read too many novels, watch too many films and go to too many plays.","You can always spot a 'television personality', even when they aren't actually on television, because they carry their 'made-up' persona in front of them, like some sort of baffler, or Ready Brek force field. Their reach for notoriety predicated on that fulsome mediocrity of talent detailed above has become frozen in their faces.","Television is the same as the telephone, and the same as the World Wide Web for that matter. People who become obsessed by the peculiarities of these communications media have simply failed to adjust to the shock of the old. People who bleat on about the 'artistic' potential of television qua television are equally deluded.","The British and American literary worlds operate in an odd kind of symbiosis: our critics think our contemporary novelists are not the stuff of greatness whereas certain contemporary Americans indubitably are. Their critics often advance the exact opposite: British fiction is cool, American naff.","I can't remember who it was who advocated that you should march with the left and dine with the right but I've often concurred, taking the view that I personify the great tolerance of Britain by consenting to being regally entertained. Besides, there is a degree of truth in the view that while the left are worthier, the right are wittier.","I write as someone who has no more time for repressive Islam than he does for repressive Christianity or Judaism, but at least look at the face in the hijab - and try to imagine the one beneath the niqab - before you depersonalise its wearer.","Not only is the statistical madness an assault on individuality, it's also one on temporality too. Statistics - even when accurate - are only an image of the past that can then be Photoshopped before being pasted on to the future.","Is there anything more useless than a crouton? I sometimes wake up in the small hours with a start and realise that what's roused me is an overpowering urge to visit violence on its originator.","In survey after survey, people report that the greatest dangers they face are, in this order: terrorist attack, plane crashes and nuclear accidents. This despite the fact that these three combined have killed fewer people in the past half-century than car accidents do in any given year.","You may have gathered that I am not the most cheerful of revellers - some characterise me as the death and soullessness of any party but it wasn't always so, believe me.","As a species, we're addicted to the facile discrimination involved in saying that something or phenomenon is either 'this' or 'that' - how much more uncomfortable that it may well be 'the other'.","Ideologists of all kinds find a strange sort of comfort in the madness of the crowd; it confirms them in their suspicion that history, far from being made by the great mass of individuals - as Marx averred - is rather unmade by a single massive individual, a collective Other, who stands in stark contrast to you and he.","Sometimes the crowd is the madness - at others it's the absence of the crowd that is.","Like all right-listening folk, I am an implacable enemy of all muzak.","Nowadays, my mood ungoverned, I'm free to think the most outrageous things, such as: might it not be a good idea to insist that drug companies give their preparations names that tell the user what they really do?","The great liberty of the fictional writer is to let the imagination out of the traces and see it gallop off over the horizon.","The fictional work is a kind of actor that wears a satirical garb but can put on other costumes as well.","The future continues to preoccupy me as a reliable source of hopes, fears and anxieties, but increasingly the present seems to have no outstanding qualities of its own, being merely a way-station through which events travel to the vast shadow lands of the past.","I think I now understand why it is that the young are so very nostalgic. They have so little by way of personal history that they polish it up and make it shine like a treasured heirloom.","It would seem that I, who never could make much sense of physics when I was at school, have now gained a strong sense of Einsteinian space-time. I am free of the nimbyism of now, and feel a strong kinship with both the dead and the unborn.","People tend to think of their lives as having a dramatic arc, because they read too much fiction.","Continuous present is all we have, and stream of consciousness - which in a novel is arguably just as artificial as the stilted dialogue that you get in most conventional novels. They're all stratagems to try to get closer to the texture of lived life.","I'm very happy for whatever plaudits might come the way of my work, but I never ever sit down to write x with y in view - whether it's a reader, a prize or a sale.","I write because I feel driven to write. I write from a sense of inner necessity. I don't write for anything other than that.","I'm an anarchist. I'm implacably opposed to heirarchical systems of power and control. I also mistrust crowds, as they often operate according to their lowest common denominator. In terms of evolutionary psychology, the crowd is very close to a herd of stampeding wildebeest.","Once the working classes were in chains, now they're in chain restaurants.","I prefer to write first drafts as soon as possible after waking, so that the oneiric inscape is still present to me.","The main differences between contemporary English and American literature is that the baleful pseudo-professionalism imparted by all those crap M.F.A. writing programs has yet to settle like a miasma of standardization on the English literary scene. But it's beginning to happen.","There is a deep sadness to American poverty, greater than the sadness of any other kind. It's because America has such an ideology of success.","Instead of looking at individual buildings, it makes more metaphorical sense to think of New York as one enormous chunk of masonry that has been cut up and carved away. It says, 'This is the ultimate polis, through which humans move like nematodes.'","The whole aesthetics of computers very much feeds into my OCD. They fill my head with obsessionalities and my actions become very repetitive. It seems quite inimical to the dreamy state out of which fiction comes which seems so much less causally repetitive than the way one works on computers."],"Will Sergeant":["I don't really go for the swagger thing too much.","You go through these little phases and fads, and it never turns out the way you think it's going to turn out.","I just like the idea of this creature or a being on the roof, you know? It's kind of spooky.","I am into drones and one chord freak outs and the paintings I am into are more minimal things the New York colour field painters and the soviet schools of the early/mid 20th century suprematism and constructionism.","I guess some fans like art and get it, others are just into the music, don't really turn up and have an opinion. The fans that have shown interest are all with me all the way."],"Will Shetterly":["Is art influential? It can be - 'Uncle Tom's Cabin' rallied abolitionists, and 'The Jungle' provoked the demand for a safer food industry.","Country music, the music of the white rural working class, has often been mocked by elitists whose understanding of power and art was shaped at expensive private schools.","Many elitists hate rap as much as they hate country, though they don't like to admit it for fear of appearing racially insensitive.","There've always been people in the borderland between childhood and adulthood. That state is not a matter of chronological age. It's a matter of understanding that you can accept a future that has been defined by the previous generation, or you can reject it and make something new."],"Will Shields":["I'm alive. That's a good thing.","Just looking at society as a whole, there are a lot of different things that we are not doing as a group to make sure we are close. Everything is in transit. People are moving from place to place. You can have a neighbor you live next to for five years and never speak to, and nobody has a problem with that.","I think I was one of those kids that I might not fight you if you stepped on my shoes or stole my lunch money or that kind of stuff. But if you picked on a girl or something like that, that would cause me to rear up a little bit.","Football is a violent game. We are violent men.","Don't forget, I was the soft, pudgy kid in school that everyone made fun of.","I'm most proud of the fact I carried myself on and off the field consistently for what the NFL stands for."],"Will Smith":["Throughout life people will make you mad, disrespect you and treat you bad. Let God deal with the things they do, cause hate in your heart will consume you too.","The first step is you have to say that you can.","Money and success don't change people; they merely amplify what is already there.","I've always considered myself to be just average talent and what I have is a ridiculous insane obsessiveness for practice and preparation.","The things that have been most valuable to me I did not learn in school.","There's so much negative imagery of black fatherhood. I've got tons of friends that are doing the right thing by their kids, and doing the right thing as a father - and how come that's not as newsworthy?","Whatever your dream is, every extra penny you have needs to be going to that.","In my mind, I've always been an A-list Hollywood superstar. Y'all just didn't know yet.","I know how to learn anything I want to learn. I absolutely know that I could learn how to fly the space shuttle because someone else knows how to fly it, and they put it in a book. Give me the book, and I do not need somebody to stand up in front of the class.","We all want to be in love and find that person who is going to love us no matter how our feet smell, no matter how angry we get one day, no matter the things we say that we don't mean.","And where I excel is ridiculous, sickening, work ethic. You know, while the other guy's sleeping? I'm working.","I'm a student of patterns. At heart, I'm a physicist. I look at everything in my life as trying to find the single equation, the theory of everything.","Traditional education is based on facts and figures and passing tests - not on a comprehension of the material and its application to your life.","If you're not willing to work hard, let someone else do it. I'd rather be with someone who does a horrible job, but gives 110% than with someone who does a good job and gives 60%.","So if you stay ready, you ain't gotta get ready, and that is how I run my life.","I want the world to be better because I was here.","I've viewed myself as slightly above average in talent. And where I excel is ridiculous, sickening work ethic.","I don't know what my calling is, but I want to be here for a bigger reason. I strive to be like the greatest people who have ever lived.","I have a great time with my life, and I wanna share it.","For me, there is nothing more valuable than how people feel in a movie theater about a movie.","When you create art, the world has to wait.","Life is lived on the edge.","A rapper is about being completely true to yourself. Being an actor is about changing who you are.","I've trained myself to illuminate the things in my personality that are likable and to hide and protect the things that are less likeable.","I love producing. I am loving doing that. I think that is my most natural space in the business. I just love producing or editing and that's where I thrive.","I had to focus and create a character in Bagger Vance, not just do my 'Will Smith' thing and get paid.","I try to speak my points of view about black America, and how I feel about black men and the role that black men should play in their lives with their children and in their lives with their women.","I would have absolutely messed up 'The Matrix'.","In black neighborhoods, everybody appreciated comedy about real life. In the white community, fantasy was funnier. I started looking for the jokes that were equally hilarious across the board, for totally different reasons.","If it was something that I really committed myself to, I don't think there's anything that could stop me becoming President of the United States.","I love being black in America, and especially being black in Hollywood.","You can cry, ain't no shame in it.","When I was growing up, I installed refrigerators in supermarkets. My father was an electrical engineer.","It's quite highly possible that I have peaked. I mean, I just can't imagine what else I could do beyond this. It's really a bittersweet kind of feeling.","I've never really viewed myself as particularly talented. I've viewed myself as slightly above average in talent.","I was raised in a Baptist household, went to a Catholic church, lived in a Jewish neighborhood, and had the biggest crush on the Muslim girls from one neighborhood over.","Tommy Lee Jones is hilarious. I would say, if you look at the body of his work, the character he is most like is the one in 'The Fugitive.' That's how he talks and jokes. That is the type of energy he has.","I'm a student of world religion, so to me, it's hugely important to have knowledge and to understand what people are doing.","I think with movies I am really connecting to the Joseph Campbell idea of the collective unconscious.","I don't necessarily believe in organized religion.","I had a hit single on the radio for 30 days before I graduated from high school.","The first time that I performed as an actor was the first day on the set of 'The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.'","Well, all I know is what I read in the papers.","My skin is hard when it comes to my music. But with my movies, I'm still a virgin in a lot of ways. I'm not used to being shot down for no reason.","My first record came out while I was a senior in high school, which is dangerous.","My school was 90 percent white, but 90 percent of the kids I played with were black. So I got the best of both worlds. I think that is where my comedy developed.","Goofy was the word that was used most often by my sisters because I've been this tall ever since I was 12 years old.","As a child, I watched 'Dallas' and that was my vision for my life for as long as I could remember.","I mean, I'm very serious with my kids about them comprehending the intricacies of global finance."],"Will Speck":["We live in cautious times where HR has a very inflated sense of authority over companies.","There's something about the struggle of a sensitive man that we really relate to.","It's tricky: with comedy in any movie, you're hungry for an audience to embrace a movie and be a part of an experience that's comedic; it's the easier way to go in some ways.","We're pretty insane about art direction.","We're really interested in more visual storytelling, figuring out a way to blend our level of observation with a bigger visual scope.","What's great about an office Christmas party is that it uncovers and reveals parts of your personality that you didn't see coming.","We had been to a couple really awkward office Christmas parties, including one at our production company. It's just a really interesting place, an event that hadn't really been captured."],"Will Steger":["I don't think there's any way we can save the polar bears.","Within 10 years it will be impossible to travel to the North Pole by dog team. There will be too much open water."],"Will Thomas":["There's no fear when you're having fun.","We all know by now that Barack Obama is not a patriot. After all, he doesn't always wear a flag pin, and he objects to the idea that he should be required to in order to run for office.","Obama has been attacked repeatedly for not wearing a flag pin, with Republicans claiming that his patriotism is in question. It's all a bit silly."],"Will Tudor":["In terms of pure comedic value, 'Tootsie' is brilliant.","I used to do prank calls as these people and try to convince certain hoteliers that I was someone else. At the time, I used to do people like Tony Blair and William Hague. It was very good fun hearing people kind of thinking, 'Hmm, is that who I think it is?'","On the whole, when I travel to different countries, I like to find the hidden places, so I tend to avoid the cities - but in terms of the ease of getting about, finding what you need, the excitement, that undercurrent of whatever you want it to be, it's got to be London.","I very much enjoy things like '24,' although I suspect that's run its course."],"Will Wright":["Because now it's the fans out there that are entertaining us, the developers, with their creations!","On vacation, I totally unplug. I don't bring a laptop with me.","A lot of the interesting issues and dynamics within a city occur over things such as socio-economic issues or ethnic issues. But they require a much more elaborate model of human behavior.","I find it refreshing to unplug from it for a while. You kind of forget how deeply you get embedded in it.","There are a lot of issues that I hope we deal with at some point that we haven't up to now, for various reasons. Some technical, and some more political.","And so from that, I've always been fascinated with the idea that complexity can come out of such simplicity.","For me, what's a more important question is how we get at least the option of more diverse experiences in this media.","Also, after people play these Sim games, it tends to change their perception of the world around them, so they see their city, house or family in a slightly different way after playing.","The new generation of consoles has as much power to do the kind of games that we do as the PC does.","I typically go overboard when I research new projects.","We have spent quite a bit of time considering a good space game, and I can't really say anything at this point, but we are definitely still interested in that area.","The console games, as they come out with this new generation, will have a temporary advantage in price performance, but there are still many things you can do on a PC, more conveniently than you can do on a console machine.","In an online community, there's this kind of social economy between the community members. Some people have status because they make cool skins or that's a good website that's visited a lot, but there's no real gameplay there.","Everybody has a different definition of the good side.","Players like to know that they've discovered things that even the designers didn't know were in the game.","I'm not saying we purposely introduced bugs or anything, but this is kind of a natural result of any complexities of software... that you can't fully test it.","And every now and then people find the bugs, and they interpret those as cool failures in the Sims terms. For them it's like a treasure hunt, you know.","The Sims is kind of an interesting case because we had all these expansion packs. We were able to incrementally add on and explore without invading the core dynamic or the core game play.","Well, I think the camera freedom is something that we've resisted for a long time and feels like probably the biggest stretch. But it has some huge benefits.","The second thing for me, probably a few clicks down, is the idea that The Sims smoothly age and have different concerns and motivations and needs at different age ranges.","It used to be that you knew your neighbors and maybe your coworkers - the people in your physical vicinity.","Yes... well, I used to have a pilot's license."],"Will Yun Lee":["Sometimes when you're in different countries, everything has become so homogenised and there's a Starbucks and McDonald's everywhere, and you could feel like you're in Florida. But in Japan, you know you're there.","Whenever you're fighting with weapons, there's a level of reality because people don't understand that these are still metal or hard rubber with sharp points - that if the timing's wrong, you could definitely get hurt. There's nothing like working with an actor who doesn't know what they're doing, because you're always in fear of losing an eye.","My martial arts background is Tae Kwon Do.","The two most exciting things for me to get to work on 'The Wolverine' was getting to work with James Mangold, the director who directed '3:10 to Yuma' and 'Walk the Line' as well as getting to work with Hugh Jackman.","My father was one of the first Tae Kwon Do Masters to come to the states in the '60s. He had one of the first all-African-American fighting teams, and I was basically raised in a karate studio since I was 3. It's part of my blood, competing, and all that stuff was responsible for a lot of me just growing up."],"Willa Cather":["There are some things you learn best in calm, and some in storm.","Some memories are realities, and are better than anything that can ever happen to one again.","Where there is great love, there are always wishes.","When kindness has left people, even for a few moments, we become afraid of them as if their reason had left them. When it has left a place where we have always found it, it is like shipwreck; we drop from security into something malevolent and bottomless.","The heart of another is a dark forest, always, no matter how close it has been to one's own.","There are only two or three human stories, and they go on repeating themselves as fiercely as if they had never happened before.","The fact that I was a girl never damaged my ambitions to be a pope or an emperor.","The sun was like a great visiting presence that stimulated and took its due from all animal energy. When it flung wide its cloak and stepped down over the edge of the fields at evening, it left behind it a spent and exhausted world.","The miracles of the church seem to me to rest not so much upon faces or voices or healing power coming suddenly near to us from afar off, but upon our perceptions being made finer, so that for a moment our eyes can see and our ears can hear what is there about us always.","Every artist makes himself born. It is very much harder than the other time, and longer.","Only solitary men know the full joys of friendship. Others have their family; but to a solitary and an exile, his friends are everything.","The stupid believe that to be truthful is easy; only the artist, the great artist, knows how difficult it is.","All the intelligence and talent in the world can't make a singer. The voice is a wild thing. It can't be bred in captivity. It is a sport, like the silver fox. It happens.","What was any art but a mould in which to imprison for a moment the shining elusive element which is life itself - life hurrying past us and running away, too strong to stop, too sweet to lose.","That is happiness; to be dissolved into something complete and great.","No one can build his security upon the nobleness of another person.","I shall not die of a cold. I shall die of having lived.","Paris is a hard place to leave, even when it rains incessantly and one coughs continually from the dampness.","Most of the basic material a writer works with is acquired before the age of fifteen.","The irregular and intimate quality of things made entirely by the human hand.","Winter lies too long in country towns; hangs on until it is stale and shabby, old and sullen.","I like trees because they seem more resigned to the way they have to live than other things do.","The condition every art requires is, not so much freedom from restriction, as freedom from adulteration and from the intrusion of foreign matter.","The dead might as well try to speak to the living as the old to the young.","Give the people a new word and they think they have a new fact.","To note an artist's limitations is but to define his talent. A reporter can write equally well about everything that is presented to his view, but a creative writer can do his best only with what lies within the range and character of his deepest sympathies.","Sometimes a neighbor whom we have disliked a lifetime for his arrogance and conceit lets fall a single commonplace remark that shows us another side, another man, really; a man uncertain, and puzzled, and in the dark like ourselves.","It does not matter much whom we live with in this world, but it matters a great deal whom we dream of.","Desire is creation, is the magical element in that process. If there were an instrument by which to measure desire, one could foretell achievement.","The thing that teases the mind over and over for years, and at last gets itself put down rightly on paper whether little or great, it belongs to Literature.","Sometimes I wonder why God ever trusts talent in the hands of women, they usually make such an infernal mess of it. I think He must do it as a sort of ghastly joke.","A work-room should be like an old shoe; no matter how shabby, it's better than a new one.","Of all the bewildering things about a new country, the absence of human landmarks is one of the most depressing and disheartening.","When we look back, the only things we cherish are those which in some way met our original want; the desire which formed in us in early youth, undirected, and of its own accord."],"Willa Fitzgerald":["It's amazing how much of a bodily experience being scared is. It doesn't take very long of hyperventilating to feel like you're going to pass out. It's one of those things where being scared is more of a physiological response that you can pretty easily manipulate. So in those types of scenes, it just takes a lot of energy.","It's been a lot of fun getting to work with Tracy Middendorf, who plays my mom. As an actor, it's always fun to have different parents and to create different familial dynamics than you have in your real life.","I guess my weirdest fear is accidentally ingesting a sharp object."],"Willa Ford":["My major influence was my ten years older sister.","You know a lot of times you'll find girls in a club are jaded to the other girls in the club. There's a nasty vibe between the chicks in the club. It's like a pretty girl can't look at another pretty girl and say Wow she's pretty.","I do house things. I paint. I do portraits. I also paint my house.","I'm not a cheerleader. I'm not trying to pretend to be sweet and then come out and be bad. This is who I am.","I like the idea that people have formed their own opinions. And of course once people meet me or talk to me their opinion totally changes because I'm much more that girl that you hang out with than you think.","The thing that I like about being me is that everybody gets a different feeling from me.","I believe honesty comes across in music because for people that music isn't just something to dance to. For people for whom music is something that they feel, they understand what I'm talking about.","They're hit writers. They're gonna write me a hit whether I wanted it or not you know? I could have put out a single a year ago with the Neptunes and maybe been writing now on top but that was not the path that I chose.","There's a million new people in the studio every day creating new stuff so I really had to be on my toes with this one so I could get it out before somebody else could.","It's a mood record. Like one night you're going to be down in the dumps depressed because you're thinking about your ex-boyfriend and the next moment you're gonna be like screw him you know? And the next one you're saying to yourself 'God I'm in love.'","I mean there are tons of reasons. Well first of all. I write my own record. I don't take other people's materials. And I have a job which is being Willa Ford on top of getting back in the studio and writing and recording.","I mean a song that's specifically for the girls. It's saying you know we talk about them night and day, we're constantly pondering on men and what they've done good and what they've done bad and all these things in our lives."],"Willa Holland":["It's so much fun to play the bad girl. Everybody has that little side of them they never really get to get out.","I enjoyed 'The OC' immensely but I want to expand my horizons more before repeating myself.","Adapting a Judy Blume book is something I really wanted to do, and you couldn't grow up in the '90s without knowing about 'Tiger Eyes' and reading it. It should've been assigned to all teenage girls.","The fashion world has always been part of my life.","I'm so proud of this show and I'm really stoked that fans were so enthusiastic about the show so quickly. I mean, I got recognized for 'Arrow' at the airport when I was headed to Vancouver to shoot the second episode. That was kind of crazy.","I think that at 21, I still look like I'm 17 years old, so I feel like I'm going to be playing teenagers for a while, and that's a very relatable stage in a teenage life for a female - that kind of rambunctious stage.","I like long floaty clothes that don't restrict me, and I live in flat boots.","I'd love to work with Julia Roberts and Johnny Depp or Dick Van Dyke. I love 'Mary Poppins' - when I was little I was obsessed with it."],"Willard Boyle":["It is a great honor to be awarded a Nobel Prize. This is a wonderful experience for my wife Betty and me. We received congratulations by email, phone and post, many from old friends we had not seen for some time.","I found that my career at Bell Telephone Labs thrived because of the environment, which encouraged cooperative research, offered opportunities for access to sophisticated equipment, and fellowship.","We lived in Northern Quebec, and the nearest school was thirty miles away, so my mother took on the task of home schooling me. She spoke to some friends, received some instructions from the provincial school board, and found some interesting books that perhaps I might find useful.","Lester Germer was my first supervisor at Bell Labs. He was the Germer of the Davisson and Germer Experiment that is sometimes referred to in introductory texts on physics."],"Willard Gaylin":["A street thug and a paid killer are professionals - beasts of prey, if you will, who have dissociated themselves from the rest of humanity and can now see human beings in the same way that trout fishermen see trout.","A man may not always be what he appears to be, but what he appears to be is always a significant part of what he is.","To probe for unconscious determinants of behavior and then define a man in their terms exclusively, ignoring his overt behavior altogether, is a greater distortion than ignoring the unconscious completely.","Expressing anger is a form of public littering."],"Willard Libby":["You honor me greatly and beyond my ability as an individual but in so doing you honor my colleagues also who made possible the results you have cited.","The future of the world, dependent as it is upon atomic energy, requires more understanding and knowledge about the atom.","Most achievements in science are to a certain degree group efforts.","We hope that this honor you have done us will bring the time of further realization of these benefits closer and will help all mankind to live better and be happier through the atom and isotopes.","True, the initial ideas are in general those of an individual, but the establishment of the reality and truth is in general the work of more than one person.","And yet the Nobel Prizes, in singling out individuals, have done a great deal of good in pointing up to the world as a whole and setting forth clearly goals for achievement."],"Willard Scott":["Positive feelings come from being honest about yourself and accepting your personality, and physical characteristics, warts and all; and, from belonging to a family that accepts you without question.","When you hit the big time, big money, big egos, people don't talk. You have no friends.","There are plenty of good-looking women out there. Go get them.","Everyone complains about the weather, but nobody ever seems to do anything about it.","The only way to predict if there's a cloud on your horizon due to glaucoma is to get tested. No matter what the diagnosis, the forecast is for clear vision in the years ahead.","Never slap a man who chews tobacco.","I'm not the dumbest guy that ever lived.","I loved Harry Truman with all my heart and soul.","I'd like to do 'Saturday Night Live.'","Remember Judy Garland? She retired 40 times.","The critics - how come you never see any of them on TV?","It was a big story and yesterday's soup. Who cares?","I'm Southern Baptist, not a meteorologist.","I wore dresses all the time. I like to wear dresses.","I think women can cope a lot better than men.","You go from Pampers to Depends!","Nature's a tranquilizer as you get older.","Everything I've ever done in my life has been a fluke.","I get all fired up about aging in America.","I got more mail than anybody on the history of The Today Show, but half of it was to get me off the air.","I've produced more pilots than United Airlines, and they've all been disasters. Every audition I ever took in my life I lost.","Just do the math. In the next 50 to 75 years, people will be living to be 130 and 140. They'll be working until they're 100. It's incredible.","August depresses me a little. I don't even feel like eating. And when I don't eat, that's a sure sign of stagnation.","The best cookies of all in the world are the ones my daughter Sally makes. They come out all uniform with nice little air holes.","Tom Browkaw said it best. He said NBC could survive without him or the rest of the news division, but not Nancy Fields.","The TV weatherman has always been one of the best, most secure jobs. They change anchors, they change the set, producers come and go. But the weather person hangs on forever!","Will Rogers was an American hero - someone you could get your teeth into and love.","When I was just starting out in the business, I used to love to watch Lorne Greene doing the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. I said right then, 'That's what I want to do someday,' and it's been one dream that has come true.","I love commercials.","I go to McDonald's at least once a week. I always get a No. 2.","Nobody actually talks to anybody anymore. People in cubicles next to each other, they e-mail each other.","There is something endearing about the weatherman.","I've always had a reputation as a buffoon.","Viewers figure, 'Uncle Willard doesn't know any more about the weather than I do.' They're right.","As an only child, I never felt insecure and always had total love.","I have always said that the best training to be a TV newsman or anybody on television is to do a children's show because you are oblivious to the fact that there is a camera there.","I run me like a conglomerate, because that's what I am.","I want to get my own show because 'Today' will eventually get tired of me, or the audience will get tired of me.","These days, you have to have a gimmick to do the weather. You have to have an act.","I do a lot of schmoozing.","My grandmother's house - she ran it just like her grandmother and her great-grandmother. They didn't have electricity. They had wood stoves that never got cold.","I talk too much. I eat too much.","Take a microphone out of my hands, and I'm just plain folks.","Thanksgiving just gets me all warm and tingly and all kinds of wonderful inside.","When something's over with me, it's over.","I have the best job in the entire history of broadcasting.","It's simply a tragedy that anyone today goes blind from glaucoma, when it's so unnecessary.","People over 100 are the fastest-growing group in America. People soon will be working 'til 100 - some because they have to - and living 'til 125 or even 135. What do I know, I'm just a weatherman, but I've made a hobby of studying this, and it's phenomenal.","Why do we love our grandparents so much? Part of the reason I think has to do with the tremendous natural affection and affinity that kids have for older people, whether they are their actual grandparents or not.","I had the privilege of having two sets of loving grandparents.","My grandmother was a typical farm-family mother. She would regularly prepare dinner for thirty people, and that meant something was always cooking in the kitchen. All of my grandmother's recipes went back to her grandmother.","Now that I'm a grandfather myself, I realize that the best thing about having grandkids is that you get the kid for the best part of the ride - kind of like owning a car for only the first 10,000 miles. You can have your grandchildren for a couple of days and then turn them back over to the parents.","In high school, I weighed 175 to 180. I looked like Abraham Lincoln. I was 6-foot-3, biggest thing in the class, but tall, not fat.","I'm a country boy.","My dad was an agent for Met Life. In the '50s, I remember the mortality rate was something like - you had - 58 was the average age. Then it was moved up to 62, and then 65, 68.","When I can, I do 25 minutes of calisthenics every day.","I still start to get panicky each morning before I go on television. I'll say, 'I'm in awful shape, something is wrong,' and if I start to look like I'm going off the deep end, Jimmy Straka, the stage manager, will say, 'You're all right. Calm down.' Then Bryant Gumbel will grab me by the leg or something.","Having a phobia has changed me."],"Willard Van Orman Quine":["To be is to be the value of a variable.","Language is a social art.","Physics investigates the essential nature of the world, and biology describes a local bump. Psychology, human psychology, describes a bump on the bump.","'Ouch' is not independent of social training. One has only to prick a foreigner to appreciate that it is an English word.","Uncritical semantics is the myth of a museum in which the exhibits are meanings and the words are labels. To switch languages is to change the labels.","The familiar material objects may not be all that is real, but they are admirable examples.","We do not learn first what to talk about and then what to say about it.","Meaning is what essence becomes when it is divorced from the object of reference and wedded to the word.","One man's observation is another man's closed book or flight of fancy.","Language is conceived in sin and science is its redemption.","It is one of the consolations of philosophy that the benefit of showing how to dispense with a concept does not hinge on dispensing with it.","Confusion of sign and object is original sin coeval with the word."],"Willard Wigan":["As a kid, I lived in a fantasy world. I used to believe ants could talk. Not once did they say thank you.","We didn't have money for toys, so I made my own.","I heard someone say that it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than a rich man to get into heaven. I decided to sculpt camels in a needle.","When you work at a microscopic level, you have to control every part of your body movement - your fingertips, your joints, the pulse in your fingers.","I'm like a mad professor, but without the spiky hair.","I'm just honoring my mother's words. She always told me, 'The smaller your work, the bigger your name will become.'","When I was a kid, I had trouble at school because of my learning disabilities. Carving is my body compensating for the lack of other skills.","Flying helicopters is what I do for fun.","The microscopic world became my obsession.","I became obsessed with making more and more tiny things. I think I was trying to find a way of compensating for my embarrassment at having learning difficulties: people had made me feel small so I wanted to show them how significant 'small' could be.","People find it very, very difficult to believe what I've done. Scientists have seen my work and they can't explain it. Even nano-scientists have seen it and been totally shocked. But if any man on Earth wants to challenge me, I'm ready. Bring it on.","Those that don't believe how small my work is should just come along and see it for themselves.","There are times when I've inhaled my work. There are artworks still inside of me.","When I first heard that Barack Obama was going to be the first black president, I wanted to do the smallest, biggest tribute in history.","My work knocks people out; you've not seen the best of me yet.","I started making houses for ants because I thought they needed somewhere to live. Then I made them shoes and hats. It was a fantasy world I escaped to where my dyslexia didn't hold me back and my teachers couldn't criticize me. That's how my career as a micro-sculptor began.","I was told I would become nothing. Now I am showing people how big nothing is.","My teacher said my brain was the size of a pea. He made my life miserable by singling me out in the classroom as a failure.","At home, when the heating pipes made noises, I imagined a tiny person was in there skipping with a rope. The fantasy world of tiny things became my escape.","At school I'd want to be so small that nobody could see me, and so my work depicts and reflects me - what it felt like to grow up in a world of pain.","People often swear the first time they see my work. I like that.","There is a child in all of us.","I always say that failure was my friend. I learned nothing at school, so I just lived in my own world."],"Willem Dafoe":["Great theatre is about challenging how we think and encouraging us to fantasize about a world we aspire to.","I am confident only when I am constantly in motion. Between projects, the doubt creeps in.","Action breeds inspiration more than inspiration breeds action.","With theatre, you have to be ready for anything.","I think on some level, you do your best things when you're a little off-balance, a little scared. You've got to work from mystery, from wonder, from not knowing.","You can be intuitive when you've got a more expansive role. You can get into the poetry of telling the story rather than just pushing buttons.","I'm one of those people who when I go over a bridge, I want to jump. It's just this intense tickle in the back of my throat. It's like I'm on the verge the whole time I'm walking over that bridge, and I'm not going to get a release until I jump.","In my experience, sometimes a movie just hits at the wrong time, gets the wrong press, or gets the wrong representation, and it gets misunderstood.","You have to lose yourself to find yourself.","I don't think people want to see me as a regular guy; besides, I'm a regular guy in real life. I guess I just want to be reckless in my work.","I do want to be in mainstream movies that are going to be seen. I suppose it satisfies the showbiz side of me.","My dad was a surgeon, my mom a nurse, and they were always out working. I had five sisters and a brother. They didn't care what I got up to.","A lot of critics are lazy. They don't want to look closely and analyze something for what it is. They take a quick first impression and then rush to compare it to something they've seen before.","I'm an optimist. I hope if a movie's good that it will be a success, but as we know, that's not always true, just because of popular taste, advertising, distribution patterns - there's lots of reasons.","I guess they often cast me as the bad guy, because I'm not, er, conventional looking. I look sort of violent. I'm the odd one out, the outsider.","The mask can be a limitation, but you just deal with it. You do get superhuman strength and pumpkin bombs and all this other stuff to express yourself with.'","The worst thing is to get involved with people who aren't passionate about what they're doing.","Weirdness is not my game. I'm just a square boy from Wisconsin.","Film is fragmented and gets into lots of other people's hands. There are a lot of pleasures that theatre gives me. You get to perform uninterrupted.","I'll never be able to really see a film that I'm in.","One of the pleasures of being an actor is quite simply taking a walk in someone else's shoes. And when I look at the roles I've played, I'm kind of amazed at all the wonderful adventures I've had and the different things I've learned.","I wish to Christ I could make up a really great lie. Sometimes, after an interview, I say to myself, 'Man, you were so honest - can't you have some fun? Can't you do some really down and dirty lying?' But the puritan in me thinks that if I tell a lie, I'll be punished.","Any actor who tells you that he makes choices, absolutely, is wrong. You find work and work finds you.","All the time, as an actor, you want to be asking what's next and where things are going. If you're not asking those questions, you're not growing.","There's a real wisdom to not saying a thing.","Let's hope I never end up on a deserted island, because I could never make a decision on which three CDs to take with me.","Turn off the sound in a movie, and if you can tell what's going on, the movie should work.","Celebrity is okay as long as you know it's not about you.","I'm no different to anyone else; I want people to like me. I just don't particularly want them to understand me.","I try to do as many of my own stunts as possible. If you keep on taking yourself out of the role you play, you lose the thread of the character.","The Midwest isn't somewhere you mix with those from the performing arts. But my mum and dad would go off to Chicago every so often to see shows. They would bring back the albums and the movies, those little eight metres, and we would all watch. I think that was when I fell in love with acting.","When I give over to somebody's vision rather than have an idea of what I need to do, it takes me to places I wouldn't have got to by myself. I'm always attracted to a strong director.","The best thing an actor can be is ready. Be flexible, be ready.","When I was a kid I was very interested in the idea of the will, finding out what you're capable of. I liked those kind of challenges.","In films you do a scene, you play around with it and unless you're doing a lot of reshooting, which no one has the luxury to do, you deal with the problem for a day and then you move on. On some level, it never allows you to go very deep into what performing is about.","The bad things about theatre get balanced by the good things in film and vice versa. So to tell you the truth, I love it when I can go back and forth - it feeds different parts of you and exercises different muscles.","It's true in the beginning I started playing villains, and I think that's pretty clear, because if you don't conventionally look a certain way and you've got a certain kind of presence when you're young, then what's available to you is character roles, and the best character roles when you're young tend to be villains.","I was watching 'Wild at Heart,' and I can honestly say I did nothing for that apart from show up!","Film is an editor's medium. You can create very good raw material and they can make it horrible, or you can do not so well and they can make it beautiful. You don't really know.","Plenty of bad movies are very successful, and plenty of good movies are not. And distribution is so crazy, some films won't even get their day in court.","I love theaters. I love the event of going there and seeing a movie with a lot of people. I like the community coming around the story.","Sometimes I say I feel more like a dancer than an actor, because there are things implied about being an actor that I don't really like. I feel more comfortable with the word 'performer'. I like being the thing. I like being the doer. There's a factualness to it. And then certain resonances happen out of how you apply yourself physically.","It's no fun for an actor to keep repeating what you did before. It's always changing. I'm changing. The target keeps moving. That's the beauty of it.","The English Patient' is about the coming together of a French-Canadian nurse, an English patient, a Sikh in a turban and me, Caravaggio, and each of us is seeking a resolution to our own problems.","I love Sam Neill. The thing that I always say about him, and I think it's true, is he's so dry. When he's serious, I think he's joking; when he's joking, I think he's serious.","I'm a task-oriented actor. A pretender. And I try to invent my process anew each time I make a new project. So I frown on any method.","I don't have a preference between theatre and film; I like to do both. But I will say that there's something about theatre that is more nourishing and sustaining than film ever can be.","I was born William. My father was William. I came from a big family, I hated being called Billy. Willem's a nickname; it's a Dutch name, very common in the Netherlands.","I think, as I've gotten older, I've been able to be more reckless with my choices, because practically speaking, you get less careful. Your choices become more instinctive, and you feel like if you make a mistake, it won't destroy you.","I'm not attracted to naturalism, I'm not attracted to behavior, I'm attracted to dance. I'm attracted to gesture, I'm attracted to singing with your voice, as opposed to having a natural manner. I'm a theater actor first, so that probably influences a lot of my approach. And I think in many ways, naturalism has ruined movies.","I've never had any close male friends. The most important relationships in my life have always been with women.","It makes me laugh when I hear a guy talking about being in touch with his feminine side. But I gravitate towards women; I identify with them. And I do cry very easily, more and more as I get older.","Sometimes I think women are lucky because they can develop in ways men can't. The old-boy network may be oppressive to women, but it actually stunts men in terms of personal growth.","Emotionally men and women are different, but only as a result of the physical differences. It all comes back to our bodies.","Truth is, generally I like film festivals; somewhere at some level there's an exchange of ideas.","Basically, when I hear the words 'family drama,' I run in the opposite direction.","When you work on anything, you want to find the range of impulses - which ones get portrayed is another question, but you want to have that complexity and that fullness, even if you're playing a cartoon character.","The director's very important to me, particularly when the director has a recognizable style.","I love doing action and stuff; the problem is usually action movies are not that interesting. Also as I get older I feel like there's less opportunities for me.","That's a frustration sometimes, that certain directors that I'd like to work with, they just aren't doing stories that I'm sort of castable in. Not always, but sometimes I have that frustration.","Corruption is something you face all the time. Avoid it.","I have no doubt that if I met Bob Dylan, it would be disappointing - and annoying to him. But that's why I like Bob Dylan.","I do know that I like to play characters that are sometimes a little on the outside - that's because it feels kind of romantic and sexier to me. I really think they are the people that we learn lessons from.","In order to inhabit a character, you've got to embrace and empathise with them.","I knew very little about 'Spider-Man'. I grew up more in the 'Superman' generation. 'Spider-Man' - I didn't know so much. But it is a really successful franchise, and I'm happy to be involved with it.","I think back story can help guide your choices, but when you're playing a scene, you're not making choices; you're just intuitive.","I set myself challenges every time I work. Ideally, I approach everything as though it's the first time - with a beginner's mind and an amateur's love."],"Willem de Kooning":["An artist is forced by others to paint out of his own free will.","I don't paint to live, I live to paint.","Whatever an artist's personal feelings are, as soon as an artist fills a certain area on the canvas or circumscribes it, he becomes historical. He acts from or upon other artists.","I make pictures and someone comes in and calls it art.","Style is a fraud. I always felt the Greeks were hiding behind their columns.","The trouble with being poor is that it takes up all your time.","My interest in desperation lies only in that sometimes I find myself having become desperate. Very seldom do I start out that way. I can see of course that, in the abstract, thinking and all activity is rather desperate.","Art never seems to make me peaceful or pure.","The attitude that nature is chaotic and that the artist puts order into it is a very absurd point of view, I think. All that we can hope for is to put some order into ourselves."],"Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands":["I'm not a protocol fetishist. It's more important to me that people feel at ease when I'm with them.","Here in the Netherlands there are towns that take part in the throwing of toilet bowls for a laugh.","I want to be a traditional king first and foremost, building on the tradition of my predecessors standing for continuity and stability in this country, but also a 21st-century king who can unite, represent and encourage society.","Sometimes it just means flying from Bogota to New York via Amsterdam to have a day with your kids. When we spend time with them, I think we do our utmost best to be really with them - on vacations or during weekends or even at breakfast in the morning.","One has to divide attention between having kids and a full workload."],"William A. Dembski":["I'm not saying that atheists can't act morally or have moral knowledge. But when I ascribe virtue to an atheist, it's as a theist who sees the atheist as conforming to objective moral values. The atheist, by contrast, has no such basis for morality. And yet all moral judgments require a basis for morality, some standard of right and wrong.","The atheist is cheating whenever he makes a moral judgment, acting as though it has an objective reference, when his philosophy in fact precludes it.","Wrong people are wrong not because of their faults but because of their presumed virtues.","There is an immediate payoff to intelligent design: it destroys the atheistic legacy of Darwinian evolution. Intelligent design makes it impossible to be an intellectually fulfilled atheist.","Because government has tremendous power, it attracts people who are eager to game the system, obtaining by force of law what they could never achieve through consensus.","In God becoming human in Jesus Christ, God has established solidarity with the human condition.","Intelligent design, unlike creationism, is a science in its own right and can stand on its own feet.","Wrong people are wrong because they use their freedom to deny it to others.","Without a unified political climate of opinion, there is little or no political profit in doing the right thing.","As long as the wrong people hold power, how can the right political climate even arise?","Give us detailed, testable, mechanistic accounts for the origin of life, the origin of the genetic code, the origin of ubiquitous bio macromolecules and assemblages like the ribosome, and the origin of molecular machines like the bacterial flagellum, and intelligent design will die a quick and painless death.","If you have no authority to legislate my freedoms, then I'm truly free, at least from you.","Precisely because intelligent design does not turn the study of biological origins into a Bible-science controversy, intelligent design is a position around which Christians of all stripes can unite.","Intelligent design is a modest position theologically and philosophically. It attributes the complexity and diversity of life to intelligence, but does not identify that intelligence with the God of any religious faith or philosophical system.","Government has a legitimate sphere of operation. The problem arises when that sphere continually expands, encompassing areas where government lacks legitimacy.","Even with the right political climate, would the wrong people refrain from doing the wrong thing?","The problem with merely writing so that you can be understood is that the wrong people, in advancing their agendas, are only too ready to misunderstand you. Writing so that you cannot be misunderstood anticipates and preempts those who would willfully distort what you are trying to say.","The wrong people will do everything in their power to guarantee that the wrong political climate will continue. It seems, then, that the wrong people ensure the wrong political climate and the wrong political climate ensures the wrong people. How then to break free of this vicious circle?","Natural selection certainly operates. It explains how bacteria will gain antibiotic resistance; it will explain how insects get insecticide resistance, but it doesn't explain how you get bacteria or insects in the first place.","Because we don't see the evil destroyed now and thus experience the suffering that evil inevitably inflicts, we are tempted to doubt God's existence and goodness.","The problem of good as it faces the atheist is this: Nature, which is the nuts-and-bolts reality for the atheist, has no values and thus can offer no grounding for good and evil. Values on the atheist view are subjective and contingent.","As a biblical inerrantist, I believe that what the Bible teaches is true and bow to the text, including its teaching about the Flood and its universality."],"William A. Drake":["A man who is not with a woman is a dead man.","Believe me, if a man doesn't know death, he doesn't know life."],"William Adams":["So I departed and was free from imprisonment.","Faith is a continuation of reason.","At which time came to us many boats and we suffered them to come aboard, being not able to resist them, which people did us no harm, neither of us understanding the one the other.","From the ship all things were taken out, so that the clothes which I took with me on my back I only had.","If our countries had war the one with the other, that was no cause that he should put us to death; with which they were out of heart that their cruel pretense failed them. For which God be forever-more praised.","In the end of five years I made supplication to the king to go out of this land, desiring to see my poor wife and children according to conscience and nature.","Not only I lost what I had in the ship, but from the captain and the company generally what was good or worth the taking was carried away; all which was done unknown to the emperor.","Now being in such grace and favor by reason I learned him some points of geometry and understanding of the art of mathematics with other things, I pleased him so that what I said he would not contrary.","So in process of four or five years the emperor called me, as divers times he had done before.","So that between the Cape of St. Maria and Japan we were four months and twenty-two days; at which time there were no more than six besides myself that could stand upon his feet.","Therefore I do pray and entreat you in the name of Jesus Christ to do so much as to make my being here in Japan known to my poor wife, in a manner a widow and my two children fatherless; which thing only is my greatest grief of heart and conscience."],"William Albert Allard":["Words and pictures can work together to communicate more powerfully than either alone.","I think the best pictures are often on the edges of any situation, I don't find photographing the situation nearly as interesting as photographing the edges.","In my photography, color and composition are inseparable. I see in color.","You've got to push yourself harder. You've got to start looking for pictures nobody else could take. You've got to take the tools you have and probe deeper.","What's really important is to simplify. The work of most photographers would be improved immensely if they could do one thing: get rid of the extraneous. If you strive for simplicity, you are more likely to reach the viewer.","All I need is my brains, my eyes and my personality, for better or for worse.","What is right? Simply put, it is any assignment in which the photographer has a significant spiritual stake... spiritually driven work constitutes the core of a photographer's contribution to culture."],"William Alexander":["Earth teach me to forget myself as melted snow forgets its life. Earth teach me resignation as the leaves which die in the fall. Earth teach me courage as the tree which stands all alone.

I never could attain a true official manner, which is highly artificial and handles trifles with ludicrously disproportionate gravity.","If any foes of mine are there, I pardon every one: I hope that man and womankind will do the same by me."],"William Ames":["Faith is the virtue by which, clinging-to the faithfulness of God, we lean upon him, so that we may obtain what he gives to us.","Hence the end of the world should be awaited with all longing by all believers.","The attributes of God tell us what He is and who He is.","From faith, hope, and love, the virtues of religion referring to God, there arises a double act which bears on the spiritual communion exercised between God and us; the hearing of the word and prayer.","In contentment and joy are found the height and perfection of all love towards our neighbor.","In the exercise of God's efficiency, the decree of God comes first. This manner of working is the most perfect of all and notably agrees with the divine nature.","Active creation is conceived as a transitive action in which there is always presupposed an object about which the agent is concerned; it is virtually but not formally transitive because it makes, not presupposes, an object.","Although the whole man partakes of this grace, it is first and most appropriately in the soul and later progresses to the body, inasmuch as the body of the man is capable of the same obedience to the will of God as the soul.","An idea in man is first impressed upon him and afterwards expressed in things, but in God it is only expressed, not impressed, because it does not come from anywhere else.","Everyone who understands the nature of God rightly necessarily knows that God is to be believed and hoped in, that he is to be loved and called upon, and to be heard in all things.","For this is our most perfect duty and yet least known to us by nature: Whatever we conceive or will should be joined with the good of our neighbor.","Hearing the word is the devout receiving of the will of God.","Nothing exists from eternity but God, and God is not the matter or a part of any creature, but only the maker.","Participation in the blessings of the union with Christ comes when the faithful have all the things needed to live well and blessedly to God.","Sanctification is not to be understood here as a separation from ordinary use or consecration to some special use, although this meaning is often present in Scripture, sometimes referring to outward and sometimes to inward or effectual separation.","Sanctification is the real change in man from the sordidness of sin to the purity of God's image.","The efficiency of God may be understood as either creation or providence.","The first act of religion, therefore, concerns those things which are communicated to us from God. The other concerns those things which we yield to God.","The good pleasure of God is an act of the divine will freely and effectively determining all things.","The goodness of a thing created is the perfection of its fitness for the use which it serves. Now that use is either particular or universal.","The ordinary ministry is that which receives all of its direction from the will of God revealed in the Scriptures and from those means which God has appointed in the church for its continual edification.","The relative property of the Son is to be begotten, that is, so to proceed from the Father as to be a participant of the same essence and perfectly carry on the Father's nature.","The starting point of sanctification is the filthiness, corruption, or stain of sin.","The will of God is eternal because He does not begin to will what He did not will before, nor cease to will what He willed before.","The will of God is single and totally one in Him.","The world has not been in existence from eternity nor could it have been according to the present dispensation and ordering of things.","Therefore, the church is not absolutely necessary as an object of faith, not even for us today, for then Abraham and the other prophets would not have given assent to those things which were revealed to them from God without any intervening help of the church.","This subsistence, or manner of being of God is his one essence so far as it has personal properties."],"William Anders":["We came all this way to explore the moon, and the most important thing is that we discovered the Earth.","You could see the flames and the outer skin of the spacecraft glowing; and burning, baseball-size chunks flying off behind us.

And we do not really love Christ unless we are prepared to face His task and to take up His Cross.","When we love anyone with our whole hearts, life begins when we are with that person; it is only in their company that we are really and truly alive.","The tragedy of life and of the world is not that men do not know God; the tragedy is that, knowing Him, they still insist on going their own way.","We will often find compensation if we think more of what life has given us and less about what life has taken away.","In the time we have it is surely our duty to do all the good we can to all the people we can in all the ways we can.","Religion fails if it cannot speak to men as they are.","When we believe that God is Father, we also believe that such a father's hand will never cause his child a needless tear.

It is enough to know that we will be for ever with Him.","If a man fights his way through his doubts to the conviction that Jesus Christ is Lord, he has attained to a certainty that the man who unthinkingly accepts things can never reach.","God himself took this human flesh upon him."],"William Bartram":["First I shall name the eagle, of which there are three species: the great grey eagle is the largest, of great strength and high flight; he chiefly preys on fawns and other young quadrupeds.","On the recollection of so many and great favours and blessings, I now, with a high sense of gratitude, presume to offer up my sincere thanks to the Almighty, the Creator and Preserver.","Turkeys, quails, and small birds, are here to be seen; but birds are not numerous in desart forests; they draw near to the habitations of men, as I have constantly observed in all my travels.","My progress was rendered delightful by the sylvan elegance of the groves, chearful meadows, and high distant forests, which in grand order presented themselves to view.","Animal substance seems to be the first food of all birds, even the granivorous tribes.","The parental, and filial affections seem to be as ardent, their sensibility and attachment, as active and faithful, as those observed to be in human nature.","The attention of a traveller, should be particularly turned, in the first place, to the various works of Nature, to mark the distinctions of the climates he may explore, and to offer such useful observations on the different productions as may occur.","Having contemplated this admirable grove, I proceeded towards the shrubberies on the banks of the river, and though it was now late in December, the aromatic groves appeared in full bloom.","If we bestow but a very little attention to the economy of the animal creation, we shall find manifest examples of premeditation, perseverance, resolution, and consumate artifice, in order to effect their purpose.","It may be proper to observe, that I had now passed the utmost frontier of the white settlements on that border.","Some tribes of birds will relieve and rear up the young and helpless, of their own and other tribes, when abandoned."],"William Beebe":["The longer we were in it, the smaller it seemed to get.","To be a naturalist is better than to be a king."],"William Bell Riley":["The first and most important reason for its elimination is the unquestioned fact that evolution is not a science; it is a hypothesis only, a speculation.","To claim, therefore, inerrancy for the King James Version, or even for the Revised Version, is to claim inerrancy for men who never professed it for themselves.","The accepted versions of the Bible are all substantially correct."],"William Bell":["It's been a rollercoaster ride. There have been some great moments and some low points... like when I was leaving Stax. That's when I actually thought of getting out of the business.","When I came out of service, the first couple of releases didn't really hit so I just took a little hiatus and sat down to see what was happening. I just glued my ears to the radio and then I started writing - the first hit record that came out was 'Everybody Loves a Winner.'","I felt a little uncomfortable because, when I went in to the military, I was the main male vocalist they had and when I came out they had like two or three vocalists. Otis came in when I was in the military, too.","I wear a lot of different hats - from writer to producer and artist. We all do 5 or 6 jobs, everything from creating our own graphic design to actually recording and the whole bit.","The first song that I wrote was when I was with The Del Rios. I was like 14 years old but I was always putting my thoughts down on paper even before then because it was like an escape - a way of unleashing all the stuff.","Some of my other heroes around that time were, oddly enough, Frank Sinatra, Nat Cole and people like that - I was always more inclined to listen to ballads.","When I came out of the military, I had a club in Memphis and I started using the The Bar Kays as my club band. They were still only in the middle school - but I'd take them on the road with me on the weekends, sometimes.","There was some scene in The Blues Brothers movie, when they had the chicken wire across the front of the stage, and it was almost like that. They had a big guard rail around the stage, which kept the college kids from getting on... we had some good times.","We worked over at that place The Plantation Inn with The Del Rios. It was really wild over there.","I stayed with them for about a year up there and, at night, worked over in Long Island at a club called The High Hat Club which was like a pseudo jazz / blues place.","Growing up in Memphis and listening to all kinds of music and dreaming... So that was one of the first times I wrote a complete song and set it to music and the whole bit. From then on, I was busy with it."],"William Bennett":["All real education is the architecture of the soul.","Real fatherhood means love and commitment and sacrifice and a willingness to share responsibility and not walking away from one's children.","Sometimes we need to remind ourselves that thankfulness is indeed a virtue.","Happiness is like a cat, If you try to coax it or call it, it will avoid you; it will never come. But if you pay not attention to it and go about your business, you'll find it rubbing against your legs and jumping into your lap.","A kind and compassionate act is often its own reward.","The formation of character in young people is educationally a different task from and a prior task to, the discussion of the great, difficult ethical controversies of the day.","Give yourself an even greater challenge than the one you are trying to master and you will develop the powers necessary to overcome the original difficulty.","Our schools should get five years to get back to where they were in 1963. If they're still bad maybe we should declare educational bankruptcy, give the people their money and let them educate themselves and start their own schools.","The elementary school must assume as its sublime and most solemn responsibility the task of teaching every child in it to read. Any school that does not accomplish this has failed.","America's support for human rights and democracy is our noblest export to the world.","If we are surrounded by the trivial and the vicious, it is all too easy to make our peace with it.","Now we have reason to be grateful once again that Al Gore is not the man in the White House, and never will be.","Our common language is English. And our common task is to ensure that our non-English-speaking children learn this common language.","It is our character that supports the promise of our future - far more than particular government programs or policies.","For children to take morality seriously they must be in the presence of adults who take morality seriously.

Properly practiced creativity can lift your claims out of the swamp of sameness and make them accepted, believed, persuasive, urgent.","Today's smartest advertising style is tomorrow's corn.","In this very real world, good doesn't drive out evil. Evil doesn't drive out good. But the energetic displaces the passive.","If your advertising goes unnoticed, everything else is academic.","Word of mouth is the best medium of all.","Just because your ad looks good is no insurance that it will get looked at. How many people do you know who are impeccably groomed... but dull?","Advertising doesn't create a product advantage. It can only convey it.","It is insight into human nature that is the key to the communicator's skill. For whereas the writer is concerned with what he puts into his writings, the communicator is concerned with what the reader gets out of it. He therefore becomes a student of how people read or listen.","Forget words like 'hard sell' and 'soft sell.' That will only confuse you. Just be sure your advertising is saying something with substance, something that will inform and serve the consumer, and be sure you're saying it like it's never been said before.","You can say the right thing about a product and nobody will listen. You've got to say it in such a way that people will feel it in their gut. Because if they don't feel it, nothing will happen.","Because an appeal makes logical sense is no guarantee that it will work.","A great ad campaign will make a bad product fail faster. It will get more people to know it's bad.","Our job is to bring the dead facts to life.","There is no such thing as a good or bad ad in isolation. What is good at one moment is bad at another. Research can trap you into the past.","No matter how skillful you are, you can't invent a product advantage that doesn't exist. And if you do, and it's just a gimmick, it's going to fall apart anyway.","Our job is to sell our clients' merchandise... not ourselves. Our job is to kill the cleverness that makes us shine instead of the product. Our job is to simplify, to tear away the unrelated, to pluck out the weeds that are smothering the product message.","I warn you against believing that advertising is a science.","An idea can turn to dust or magic, depending on the talent that rubs against it.","We don't ask research to do what it was never meant to do, and that is to get an idea."],"William Beveridge":["Ignorance is an evil weed, which dictators may cultivate among their dupes, but which no democracy can afford among its citizens.","The object of government in peace and in war is not the glory of rulers or of races, but the happiness of common man.","Scratch a pessimist and you find often a defender of privilege."],"William Billings":["In the first place, you must pay great attention to the key note.","It is much the best way... to lay the emphasis on the first part of the bar in triple time, and on the first and third parts of the bar in common time.","Let tyrants shake their iron rod."],"William Binney":["If you're in government, that's one of the one things you have to do is to always avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest.","I think the FISA court's basically totally irrelevant.","We're not getting a good return on investment on all that money we're pumping into the intelligence community. One of the first things I would suggest is that if there's an attack and they fail to stop it or to alert us before it happens, that we ought to start cutting their budget, and for every attack they should lose ten percent of their budget.","As I have said in the past, revealing specific targets or successes of U.S. intelligence activities is not in the public interest.","At least 80% of fibre-optic cables globally go via the U.S. This is no accident and allows the U.S. to view all communication coming in. At least 80% of all audio calls, not just metadata, are recorded and stored in the U.S. The NSA lies about what it stores.","The ultimate goal of the NSA is total population control, but I'm a little optimistic with some recent Supreme Court decisions, such as law enforcement mostly now needing a warrant before searching a smartphone.","I call people who are covering up NSA crimes traitors.","You don't hear anybody talking about what FBI is doing with the NSA collected data. That's because they're doing it in secret. I mean, they're also using it to convict people of crimes, and that's what they're doing - they're looking at it for criminal activity.","Reagan used to say that 'we're a country with a government.' Well, now we're a government with a country, and we're making everybody else that way, too.","No NSA director did as much damage to the agency as Gen. Michael V. Hayden.","You've got the NSA doing all this collecting of material on all of its citizens - that's what the SS, the Gestapo, the Stasi, the KGB, and the NKVD did.","Trailblazer was the NSA's attempt to catch up with the digital age. The problem is, Trailblazer didn't do anything. As far as I know, it didn't produce anything for roughly a little over $4 billion.","When I left NSA, it was with an understanding that you can never underestimate the power of large numbers of stupid people.","The problem with a group is, the more people you add, the lower the average IQ."],"William Blackstone":["The husband and wife are one, and that one is the husband.","It is better that ten guilty escape than one innocent suffer.","Men was formed for society, and is neither capable of living alone, nor has the courage to do it.","The law, which restrains a man from doing mischief to his fellow citizens, though it diminishes the natural, increases the civil liberty of mankind.","The public good is in nothing more essentially interested, than in the protection of every individual's private rights.","No enactment of man can be considered law unless it conforms to the law of God.","Free men have arms; slaves do not.","So great moreover is the regard of the law for private property, that it will not authorize the least violation of it; no, not even for the general good of the whole community.","That the king can do no wrong is a necessary and fundamental principle of the English constitution.","The Royal Navy of England hath ever been its greatest defense and ornament; it is its ancient and natural strength; the floating bulwark of the island."],"William Blake":["Think in the morning.

Fires were seen on the low land near Cape Frederick Henry, and at daylight we saw the natives with our glasses.","The ship was masted according to the proportion of the navy; but on my application the masts were shortened, as I thought them too much for her, considering the nature of the voyage.","There is a degree of wretchedness and want among the lower class of people which is not anywhere so common as among the Spanish and Portuguese settlements.","Adventure Bay is a convenient and safe place for any number of ships to take in wood and water during the summer months: but in the winter, when the southerly winds are strong, the surf, on all parts of the shore, makes the landing exceedingly troublesome.","All the 20th we were endeavouring to get into Adventure Bay but were prevented by variable winds.","Beef also was difficult to be procured and exceedingly poor; the price nearly sixpence farthing per pound.","On the 28th the ship's company received two months pay in advance, and on the following morning we worked out to St. Helen's, where we were obliged to anchor.","Our plants had now increased to 252: as they were all kept on shore at the tent I augmented the guard there, though from the general conduct of the natives there did not appear the least occasion for so much caution.","The Cape Town is considerably increased within the last eight years.

I don't suffer from that.","In the broad spectrum of the arts, two worlds rarely overlap - the literary world and the world of rock music.","Even though I've been an avid consumer of contemporary music since my early teens, the world of rock music has always been at something of a distance - I listen to it, read about it, I talk about it, but I've had little or no contact with its denizens.","Do we change every time we have a new encounter?

It's that the work is there, and you can walk into many bookshops throughout the world and buy it.","I know many older writers who were very successful and whose books are now out of print, so you have to go to antiquarian booksellers to buy their fifth or eighth novel or whatever it is.","At a time when there's younger writers starting up and it's inevitable that you're becoming less fashionable, at a time when the industrial pressures apply more and more to books, how do you keep a book you wrote 28 years ago selling well year on year? Because it really is getting harder."],"William Bratton":["Broken-windows enforcement is really about controlling behavior to such an extent you change it: If you deal with the little things, you can keep them from going into the big things. Zero tolerance implies zealotry. It's oppressive. And it's not achievable.

All the freedoms we enjoy - freedom of speech, freedom of worship, freedom from fear - sit on a foundation of public safety.","Clearly, a large number of people who shouldn't have firearms actually apply through the process and obtain firearms.","Stop-and-frisk is not something that you can stop. It is an absolutely basic tool of American policing. It would be like asking a doctor to give an examination to you without using his stethoscope.","No place is unpoliceable; no crime is immune to better enforcement efforts.","If an African-American or a recent immigrant - or anyone else, for that matter - can't feel secure walking into a police station or up to a police officer to report a crime, because of a fear that they're not going to be treated well, then everything else that we promise is on a shaky foundation.","We all have a fundamental right to live free from fear, free from crime, and free from disorder - but while we share that right, we also share the duty to secure it.","It's an unfortunate fact that in the male black population, a very significant percentage of them, more so than whites or other minority candidates, because of convictions, prison records, are never going to be hired by a police department. That's a reality. That's not a byproduct of stop-and-frisk.","Quality-of-life policing is based on probable cause - an officer has witnessed a crime personally or has a witness to the crime.","Race is something that's always haunted American policing.","I disliked everything about the '60s.","Some cops I don't like - the corrupt, the brutal.","Cops have been complaining about morale since police forces were created. I used to complain about it a lot when I was a young cop.","Slavery, our country's original sin, sat on a foundation codified by laws enforced by police, by slave-catchers.","You cannot police a community without effectively working with the community.","I have a temper, and it can flare from time to time, but as I've gotten older and more experienced, I think I use it in a controlled way.

When we are weary of the living, we may repair to the dead, who have nothing of peevishness, pride, or design in their conversation.","An aged man is but a paltry thing, a tattered coat upon a stick, unless soul clap its hands and sing, and louder sing for every tatter in its mortal dress.","I think you can leave the arts, superior or inferior, to the conscience of mankind.","I balanced all, brought all to mind, the years to come seemed waste of breath, a waste of breath the years behind, in balance with this life, this death.","An intellectual hatred is the worst.","Accursed who brings to light of day the writings I have cast away.","Nor dread nor hope attend a dying animal; a man awaits his end dreading and hoping all.","I am of a healthy long lived race, and our minds improve with age."],"William C.

The only thing that is driving me is self-satisfaction, self-validation.","As the technology is developed, autonomous driving could provide driving opportunities for the physically challenged or enable the elderly to continue driving longer. This will be vital as many nations experience an aging population.","I believe fuel cells could end the 100-year reign of the internal combustion engine.","I look at safety as, you know, there's active and passive. Passive is how do you survive a crash. Active is accident avoidance. And so that's real-time information to you, as a driver, and to your car, to the wheels of a car that will get you out of a bad situation.","When Henry Ford founded the company bearing his name in 1903, he saw the car as a means of providing freedom of mobility to people around the world.","There is a great demand everywhere in the world for individual mobility. People like the fact they are not on somebody else's schedule. They can come and go as they please.","I have no patience for wasting time.","Nobody's irreplaceable, including me. I think for too long we've had a cult of personality in this company and in this industry, and frankly, I'd like to see that diminish.","Just think in terms of green energy and how much time, money, brain power and policy action has started to pour into green energy, and I think that's wonderful. We're going to need that same kind of effort towards global gridlock if we're going to keep the individual mobility that we all take for granted today.","When we're in a peak, we make a ton of money, and as soon as we make a ton of money, we're desperately looking for a way to spend it. And we diversify into areas that, frankly, we don't know how to run very well.","As long as gas is cheaper than bottled water, we can't be in a position of dictating to the consumer what to buy.","Manufacturing still has the greatest multiplier effect, in terms of job creation, of any sector of the economy.","All things being equal, I think people would still prefer to do business with their hometown companies. That's true in America, that's true in China, that's true in Germany.","I don't ever want to believe my own press clippings, good or bad.","One of the things I've had the advantage of, growing up and being close to the top management of this company and other companies for most of my life, is seeing how CEOs start to believe in their own infallibility. And that really scares me.","We took our eye off the ball as a company.","I walked in and inherited a management group that I didn't know very well. They didn't know me, and we had a very short window to put together a credible recovery plan.","I think the world is filled with so much hype and PR bull. Frankly, it all comes out in the end. Good or bad, I'd rather just let our accomplishments really speak for themselves.","I don't care where you are in the world, people are aware of what technology is available to others. If you're in Nairobi, you're certainly aware of the iPhone.","One cannot find a healthy economy anywhere in the world that does not have a strong industrial base, period.","I believe very strongly that corporations could and should be a major force for resolving social and environmental concerns in the twenty-first century.","When I joined Ford, in the late 1970s, I felt strongly we could not forever be a huge user of natural resources without there being consequences. But I was alone in my thinking in those days.","I never wanted Ford to be a place, like the tobacco industry, where our employees were not proud of coming to work for us. I felt there was a danger of that, should we be marginalized as a major polluter.","I think I was the first executive to ever speak at a Greenpeace business conference, in London in 2001. That didn't play well here at Ford, but I thought it was an important signal to send internally, that these were the kind of issues we needed to be grappling with.","My father was a great business leader and humanitarian who dedicated his life to the company and the community. He also was a wonderful family man, a loving husband, father, grandfather and great-grandfather. He will be greatly missed by everyone who knew him, yet he will continue to inspire us all.","S.U.V.'s are under a lot of scrutiny these days, and yet the S.U.V. buyer is a very loyal lot.","My great-grandfather was a man of great vision, drive, and native intelligence, with some human flaws amplified by limited education, limited social range, and questionable influence from some of his advisers.","At Ford Motor Company, we believe the arts speak a common language that weaves a common thread among all people.","There are people who think I'm a Bolshevik, and this is all a major distraction at best and heresy at worst. But I really don't care.","I don't want anybody, whether it's my grandchildren or any of our employees' grandchildren, to have to apologise for working for Ford Motor Company. In fact, I want the opposite. I want them to look and say, 'What a difference we made!'","The day will come when the notion of car ownership becomes antiquated. If you live in a city, you don't need to own a car.","Ford comes first before everything else I do in my life.","I was an absolutely untalented designer.","The Ford Motor Co. should stand for something more than cars and trucks. There is a Ford way of doing things that we cannot lose... We need to be continuously polishing that Ford oval.","There are almost no limits in terms of what a car can become.","It's hard to store natural gas. And it does require big storage tanks. So it doesn't work very well on passenger cars.","You can take weight out of a car and truck and still make it very strong.","Individuals and companies that want to be successful in the 21st century will need to be leaders in using the Internet and related technology.","Lyft is enabling an exciting new model of freedom and personal mobility, as evidenced by its millions of satisfied users.","There's a rising tide of environmental awareness and activism among consumers that's going to continue to swell in the 21st century. Smart companies will get ahead of that wave and ride it to success and prosperity. Those that don't are headed for a wipeout.","Lewis Booth and Derrick Kuzak represent the very best of Ford and our culture and built a legacy of leadership, integrity and commitment to excellence that will benefit us for years to come.","I don't know if a company can have a soul, but I like to think it can.","Nature is where my heart is.","I used to wonder if running a large industrial company would really square with my values.","The climate is changing, and anyone who disagrees is, in my view, still in denial.","Long commutes and traffic jams once associated with older, established cities such as London, New York or Tokyo are spreading throughout the world's emerging economies.","Cars will talk to each other and the world around them to make driving both safer and more efficient. 'Vehicle-to-vehicle' and 'vehicle-to-infrastructure' connectivity will become commonplace.","I bleed Ford blue.","In the time of the robber barons, my great grandfather insisted on reinvesting and sharing profits with workers... He was told he was a socialist, that he was not welcome on Wall Street.","What cooler way to grow up for an American boy than to be around cars and football?","Whenever I'm at a party, people are always telling me either to get a new quarterback or make the Taurus back seat bigger.","My father didn't push me.","The Ford family wants the company to succeed.

They make common cause in behalf of the sex; and, indeed, this is natural enough, when we consider the vast power that the law gives us over them.","It is not the greatness of a man's means that makes him independent, so much as the smallness of his wants.","To be poor and independent is very nearly an impossibility.","Sit down to write what you have thought, and not to think about what you shall write.","The power which money gives is that of brute force; it is the power of the bludgeon and the bayonet.","Never esteem men on account of their riches or their station. Respect goodness, find it where you may.","From a very early age I had imbibed the opinion that it was every man's duty to do all that lay in his power to leave his country as good as he had found it.","Men of integrity are generally pretty obstinate, in adhering to an opinion once adopted.","The tendency of taxation is to create a class of persons who do not labor, to take from those who do labor the produce of that labor, and to give it to those who do not labor.","There never yet was, and never will be, a nation permanently great, consisting, for the greater part, of wretched and miserable families.","To live well, to enjoy all things that make life pleasant, is the right of every man who constantly uses his strength judiciously and lawfully.","To be without sure and safe friends in the world makes life not worth having; and whom can we be so sure of as of our children?","The taste of the times is, unhappily, to give to children something of book-learning, with a view of placing them to live, in some way or other, upon the labour of other people.","To have a dutiful family, the father's principle of rule must be love, not fear. His sway must be gentle, or he will have only an unwilling and short-lived obedience.","Endless are the instances of men of bright parts and high spirit having been, by degrees, rendered powerless and despicable by their imaginary wants.","Never - no, not for one moment - believe that any human being, with sense in his skull, will love or respect you on account of your fine or costly clothes.","The great security of all is to eat little and to drink nothing that intoxicates.

I use it as a way of weakening the reader's defenses so that I can more easily take him to something more.","When a writer becomes a reader of his or her own work, a lot can go wrong.

Security is an insipid thing.","A hungry wolf at all the herd will run, In hopes, through many, to make sure of one.","Grief walks upon the heels of pleasure; married in haste, we repent at leisure.","You are a woman: you must never speak what you think; your words must contradict your thoughts, but your actions may contradict your words.","Beauty is the lover's gift.","They are at the end of the gallery; retired to their tea and scandal, according to their ancient custom.","I find we are growing serious, and then we are in great danger of being dull.","Fear comes from uncertainty.

A citizen of the United States, travelling on the continent of Europe, finds the contrast between a government of power and a government of opinion forced upon him at every step.","Nothing can be more striking to one who is accustomed to the little inclosures called public parks in our American cities, than the spacious, open grounds of London.

I think Goldman has as many A players, but more importantly they have fewer C players. And no firm, I have noticed, has the depth anywhere like that.","People are pretty simple: they do what they are rewarded for doing.

At last one of them came towards us, and the rest followed at a distance."],"William Daniels":["He's computerized, but I won't let him come on cold. I created KITT.

He was moving toward that already but then took a turn into the juvenile with Paige.","A show like Knots or any other show that can be called a soap opera does terribly in syndication because if you're a viewer and you miss a week you don't know what's going on.","And all of Laura's stuff, what they wrote originally wasn't as good and Constance wound up doing that herself. That was all her stuff, reading to the child, because she had children herself and that's what she would have done.","And I have to credit David Jacobs with the opportunities he gave me. He was totally into sharing the creation of characters. David put together a show that told the story of people over many years' time and that was greatly enjoyable. Though nowadays that is frowned upon.","At one time, whenever the hell it was, they wanted a character to come in and stir up the pot. They brought me in for 8-10 episodes and said we'll try it for that.","Clint Eastwood is aging beautifully. But someone like Burt Reynolds and others are practically destroying their faces in the amount of work they have.","David was the kind of guy who was totally supportive of the actors and instructed the writing staff to trust the actor's instincts, since after all, it's the actors playing the character.","Donna Mills came on the show as a female antagonist, about a year before, so now they wanted to have a male antagonist. I was cast as a Senator to shake things up.","Even though shows like NYPD Blue are soaps in my opinion, but they're individualized to an extent that you can still follow what's going on if you miss a week.","I'm trying to find a character that's my age and I can sustain week after week. I'd like to do a series.","I didn't care about that because I'm not a diplomatic person to begin with. I just went along with things and did what I wanted to do because I knew they had to shoot their 12 pages a day. And when they realized that I didn't alter the text they really didn't mind what I did.","I knew with The West Wing that that wasn't going to be for very long, that I was just the red herring.","I try to watch only real things, which basically amounts to C-Span for me. I like real people in real situations. I learn from that.","I would fix other people's lines if they asked me on occasion. The hard part of writing is the architecture of it, getting the story and structuring it. Not the tweaking of lines.","If you watch Cheers, in 12 years they didn't age a day.","It worked well because Don Murray didn't want to be on Knots anymore.","Networks don't want a show with a continuing story. There's no backend potential.","The business is built on slowing or even stopping the aging process.","The same issue is happening on a show like Everybody Loves Raymond now, which is in its eighth year and struggling to come up with good stories. It'll be interesting to see how they do. The bottom line is, it starts with the writers and ends with the writers.","The West Wing seems to be feeding the myth about how presidential politics are.","There's a certain possessiveness of writers sometimes.","Ultimately the Emmys are a popularity contest.","What I would have liked to do on that show was play a secretary of state who has huge personal business interests throughout the world. That, to me, seems to be more in synch with reality.","When you go to a movie, it's about what's not being said. I tried to bring that to Greg Sumner. It was always about what's not being said.","Writers are not always right however, but then again, I've been on shows where the actors have complete control and change everything and it's terrible.","I don't play polo anymore because I am too old.

The heated mind resents the chill touch and relentless scrutiny of logic.","Here is my first principle of foreign policy: good government at home.","No one ever became great except through many and great mistakes.","It is the duty of government to make it difficult for people to do wrong, easy to do right.","Nothing that is morally wrong can be politically right.","All the world over, I will back the masses against the classes.","It is not a life at all.

He didn't like movies, generally, unless Clint or Burt were in them.","That's the cool thing, when I get to work with people I love. The biggest has probably been Kris Kristofferson on 'Bloodworth.'","I was a rabid 'Seinfeld' fan. Then I did the show, and it ruined the show for me. Not that it ruined the quality of the show, but I had seen behind the curtain at Oz.","I remember on the 'Midnight Special' seeing a video with Meat Loaf. I think it was the 'Bat Out Of Hell' video.

Composition is important, but so are many other things, from content to the way colours work with or against each other.","Something new always slowly changes right in front of your eyes - it just happens.","I met and became close with John Szarkowski of the Museum of Modern Art. He was incredibly supportive about me working in color.","I like to think that my works flow like music. That may be one reason I work in large groups versus one picture of one thing; it's the flow of the whole series that counts.","I had this notion of what I called a democratic way of looking around, that nothing was more important or less important.","Black-and-white photography, which I was doing in the very early days, was essentially called art photography and usually consisted of landscapes by people like Ansel Adams and Edward Weston. But photographs by people like Adams didn't interest me.","A lot of my friends were mostly working in black-and-white - people like Lee Friedlander, Diane Arbus, Garry Winogrand, and others.

I don't have favourite pictures.","I work very quickly. I only ever take one picture of one thing. Literally. Never two."],"William Ellery Channing":["Fix your eyes on perfection and you make almost everything speed towards it.","Great minds are to make others great. Their superiority is to be used, not to break the multitude to intellectual vassalage, not to establish over them a spiritual tyranny, but to rouse them from lethargy, and to aid them to judge for themselves.","No power in society, no hardship in your condition can depress you, keep you down, in knowledge, power, virtue, influence, but by your own consent.","No one should part with their individuality and become that of another.","Faith is love taking the form of aspiration.","Difficulties are meant to rouse, not discourage. The human spirit is to grow strong by conflict.","We smile at the ignorance of the savage who cuts down the tree in order to reach its fruit; but the same blunder is made by every person who is over eager and impatient in the pursuit of pleasure.","God is another name for human intelligence raised above all error and imperfection, and extended to all possible truth.","It is not the quantity but the quality of knowledge which determines the mind's dignity.","All noble enthusiasms pass through a feverish stage, and grow wiser and more serene.","Error is discipline through which we advance.","Every human being has a work to carry on within, duties to perform abroad, influence to exert, which are peculiarly his, and which no conscience but his own can teach.","The great hope of society is in individual character.","Every human being is intended to have a character of his own; to be what no others are, and to do what no other can do.","Do anything rather than give yourself to reverie.","How easy to be amiable in the midst of happiness and success.","The mind, in proportion as it is cut off from free communication with nature, with revelation, with God, with itself, loses its life, just as the body droops when debarred from the air and the cheering light from heaven.","It is far more important to me to preserve an unblemished conscience than to compass any object however great.","Undoubtedly a man is to labor to better his condition, but first to better himself.","Grandeur of character lies wholly in force of soul, that is, in the force of thought, moral principle, and love, and this may be found in the humblest condition of life.","The home is the chief school of human virtues.","Every mind was made for growth, for knowledge, and its nature is sinned against when it is doomed to ignorance.","It is chiefly through books that we enjoy intercourse with superior minds. In the best books, great men talk to us, give us their most precious thoughts, and pour their souls into ours.","Each of us is meant to have a character all our own, to be what no other can exactly be, and do what no other can exactly do.","Every man is a volume if you know how to read him.","God be thanked for books; they are the voices of the distant and the dead, and make us heirs of the spiritual life of past ages.","Nothing which has entered into our experience is ever lost.","One good anecdote is worth a volume of biography.","The office of government is not to confer happiness, but to give men the opportunity to work out happiness for themselves.","The world is governed by opinion.","Life has a higher end, than to be amused.","Influence is to be measured, not by the extent of surface it covers, but by its kind.","He who is false to the present duty breaks a thread in the loom, and you will see the effect when the weaving of a life-time is unraveled.","The reveries of youth, in which so much energy is wasted, are the yearnings of a Spirit made for what it has not found but must forever seek as an Ideal.","The best books for a man are not always those which the wise recommend, but often those which meet the peculiar wants, the natural thirst of his mind, and therefore awaken interest and rivet thought."],"William Empson":["My heart pumps yet the poison draught of you.","Slowly the poison the whole blood stream fills.

It abounds in pseudonyms and disguises, in sudden and unexpected appearances and retreats as unexpected and sudden, in scandals and in rumours, in mysteries and traps and ambuscades of every kind.","There are two men in Tolstoy. He is a mystic and he is also a realist. He is addicted to the practice of a pietism that for all its sincerity is nothing if not vague and sentimental; and he is the most acute and dispassionate of observers, the most profound and earnest student of character and emotion.","To be a good Briton, a man must trade profitably, marry respectably, live cleanly, avoid excess, revere the established order, and wear his heart in his breeches pocket or anywhere but on his sleeve.","In the fell clutch of circumstance, I have not winced nor cried aloud: Under the bludgeoning of chance my head is bloody, but unbowed.","Essayists, like poets, are born and not made, and for one worth remembering, the world is confronted with a hundred not worth reading. Your true essayist is, in a literary sense, the friend of everybody.","Shakespeare and Rembrandt have in common the faculty of quickening speculation and compelling the minds of men to combat and discussion.","Shakespeare often writes so ill that you hesitate to believe he could ever write supremely well; or, if this way of putting it seem indecorous and abominable, he very often writes so well that you are loth to believe he could ever have written thus extremely ill.","This is the merit and distinction of art: to be more real than reality, to be not nature but nature's essence.","It is the artist's function not to copy but to synthesise: to eliminate from that gross confusion of actuality which is his raw material whatever is accidental, idle, irrelevant, and select for perpetuation that only which is appropriate and immortal.","Balzac's ambition was to be omnipotent. He would be Michelangelesque, and that by sheer force of minuteness. He exaggerated scientifically, and made things gigantic by a microscopic fulness of detail.","Men there have been who have done the essayist's part so well as to have earned an immortality in the doing; but we have had not many of them, and they make but a poor figure on our shelves. It is a pity that things should be thus with us, for a good essayist is the pleasantest companion imaginable.","Now, to read poetry at all is to have an ideal anthology of one's own, and in that possession to be incapable of content with the anthologies of all the world besides."],"William Ernest Hocking":["I find that a man is as old as his work.

She is there, but people must want her, and seek her out.","We love your adherence to democratic principles.","Idealism is fine, but as it approaches reality, the costs become prohibitive.","Even if one takes every reefer madness allegation of the prohibitionists at face value, marijuana prohibition has done far more harm to far more people than marijuana ever could.","All adventure is now reactionary.","I would like to electrocute everyone who uses the word 'fair' in connection with income tax policies.","Some of my instincts are reprehensible.","It seems to me that the idea traditionally defended of endeavoring to maintain existing ethnic balances simply doesn't work any more.","I won't insult your intelligence by suggesting that you really believe what you just said.","I'd rather entrust the government of the United States to the first 400 people listed in the Boston telephone directory than to the faculty of Harvard University.","I would like to take you seriously, but to do so would affront your intelligence.","There is an inverse relationship between reliance on the state and self-reliance.","It is not a sign of arrogance for the king to rule.

Thus their form, application, and utility are exactly like those of the splinters applied to a broken limb in surgery.","The admirals of his majesty's fleet are classed into three squadrons, viz. the red, the white, and the blue.","Of whatsoever number a fleet of ships of war is composed, it is usually divided into three squadrons; and these, if numerous, are again separated into divisions.","The fleet being thus more inclosed will more readily observe the signals, and with greater facility form itself into the line of battle a circumstance which should be kept in view in every order of sailing.","In the time of battle the hammocs, together with their bedding, are all firmly corded, and fixed in the nettings on the quarter-deck, or whereever the men are too much exposed to the view or fire of the enemy.","The head of a ship however has not always an immediate relation to her name, at least in the British navy."],"William Feather":["One way to get the most out of life is to look upon it as an adventure.","A budget tells us what we can't afford, but it doesn't keep us from buying it.","One of the funny things about the stock market is that every time one person buys, another sells, and both think they are astute.","Early morning cheerfulness can be extremely obnoxious.","Some people are making such thorough preparation for rainy days that they aren't enjoying today's sunshine.","If we do not discipline ourselves the world will do it for us.","The prizes go to those who meet emergencies successfully. And the way to meet emergencies is to do each daily task the best we can.","Success seems to be largely a matter of hanging on after others have let go.","No man is a failure who is enjoying life.","The wisdom of the wise and the experience of the ages is preserved into perpetuity by a nation's proverbs, fables, folk sayings and quotations.","When ordering lunch, the big executives are just as indecisive as the rest of us.","If you're naturally kind, you attract a lot of people you don't like.","Beware of the person who can't be bothered by details.","Temporary success can be achieved in spite of lack of other fundamental qualities, but no advancements can be maintained without hard work.","Every social injustice is not only cruel, but it is economic waste.","A man must not deny his manifest abilities, for that is to evade his obligations.","Most of us regard good luck as our right, and bad luck as a betrayal of that right.","Finishing a good book is like leaving a good friend.","The reward of energy, enterprise and thrift is taxes.","Setting a good example for your children takes all the fun out of middle age.","Books open your mind, broaden your mind, and strengthen you as nothing else can.","One of the many things nobody ever tells you about middle age is that it's such a nice change from being young.","Wealth flows from energy and ideas.","Don't let ambition get so far ahead that it loses sight of the job at hand.","An idea isn't worth much until a man is found who has the energy and ability to make it work.","Not a tenth of us who are in business are doing as well as we could if we merely followed the principles that were known to our grandfathers.","Plenty of people miss their share of happiness, not because they never found it, but because they didn't stop to enjoy it.","Something that has always puzzled me all my life is why, when I am in special need of help, the good deed is usually done by somebody on whom I have no claim.","The philosophy behind much advertising is based on the old observation that every man is really two men - the man he is and the man he wants to be.","We always admire the other person more after we've tried to do his job.","If people really liked to work, we'd still be plowing the land with sticks and transporting goods on our backs.","One of the indictments of civilizations is that happiness and intelligence are so rarely found in the same person.","Some of us might find happiness if we quit struggling so desperately for it.","Women lie about their age; men lie about their income.","Here is the secret of inspiration: Tell yourself that thousands and tens of thousands of people, not very intelligent and certainly no more intelligent than the rest of us, have mastered problems as difficult as those that now baffle you.","Back of ninety-nine out of one-hundred assertions that a thing cannot be done is nothing, but the unwillingness to do it.","Concentrate on your job and you will forget your other troubles.","When lying, be emphatic and indignant, thus behaving like your children.","Few of us get anything without working for it.","The tragedy is that so many have ambition and so few have ability.","Many of our prayers were not answered, and for this we are now grateful.","Next to a sincere compliment, I think I like a well-deserved and honest rebuke.","An invitation to a wedding invokes more trouble than a summons to a police court.","Business is always interfering with pleasure - but it makes other pleasures possible.","That they may have a little peace, even the best dogs are compelled to snarl occasionally.","He isn't a real boss until he has trained subordinates to shoulder most of his responsibilities.","The best sermon is preached by the minister who has a sermon to preach and not by the man who has to preach a sermon.","Any man who makes a speech more than six times a year is bound to repeat himself, not because he has little to say, but because he wants applause and the old stuff gets it."],"William Fichtner":["What I truly get excited about is not the genre of a movie or the size of a part - it's character. I like to find characters.","It's not that there aren't people who care creatively in the world of television, but there's always a bit more time in making a movie. I always feel films are more of a creative journey.","I have no problem having any actor from anywhere play a role. I'm excited for any actor that gets a job, I truly am. Even if it's a role that I'm up for and I don't get it, I never begrudge any actor having it work out for them.","When you work on a Jerry Bruckheimer film, you can be sure of two things: no production value will be spared, and the catering will be as fine as any really really good restaurant. Jerry is an amazing producer, with a commitment to his films second to none.","When I was younger, I never wanted to rehearse because I thought that someone would figure out I don't know what I'm doing. Now I like to really spend the time and figure it out, and rehearsal is to try something that doesn't work.","Here's the bottom line: I can't play someone if I can't figure out what he cares about. Everybody cares about something, even a rough character. It defines where we step in life. As soon as you find out what somebody cares about, then it all gets real."],"William Finnegan":["Inequality is on the rise.","For billionaires who cannot buy good press, there is the option of buying the press.","As I travelled around Australia, strangers in pubs, on airplanes, in beach parking lots would bring up Gina Rinehart, not knowing I was writing about her. Everybody had something to say, some of it thoughtful, some of it poorly informed, some of it vividly obscene.","Writing is pretty flexible work, don't you think? If you want to surf, you just have to get a lot done when the waves are lousy. That's what I'm always telling myself, anyway - write while the surf's down!","There are good waves not that far from Manhattan - on Long Island, in north Jersey. It's true that the best surf around here tends to happen in winter, so you need a good wetsuit, and the time window of good waves is often pretty short, so you have to stay on top of the forecasts.","Mandela's political evolution was gradual."],"William Floyd":["The one thing you can't do when you're highly ranked is relax.","Have any of our friends got off the Island with their families, or what must they submit to?

And in the true sense, from my training, I try to create a character each time. It is something I do. But I don't want that term to limit what I can do. I prefer people to say to me, 'You're one of my favorite actors,' rather than 'You're one of my favorite character actors.' It sounds like a slam.","I love Rob Zombie. Rob's just a dude, you know? He's an artist, but he's a regular guy, down to earth. And he's a damned good director, too, and a lot of fun to work with.","I was never a 'bad' kid, but I did get into minor juvenile trouble. Look, I grew up in Brooklyn. This was the '60s, and the neighborhood was rapidly changing and not without its problems. All the kids of the neighborhood 'did their thing,' breaking windows and the like. I was no different.","I can't stop watching black and white movies. I live in a world of Warner Brothers movies and all of that stuff from an older era, and I love them. I still love them. When I look at them, I sometimes think I was born in the wrong time.","I did nine episodes of 'John Doe.' I died of boredom.","I prefer people to say to me, 'You're one of my favorite actors,' rather than 'You're one of my favorite character actors.' It sounds like a slam. At least it sounds that way to me.","I went to Catholic school, and there was this teacher, a Brother, who saw I could go either way, good or bad. He took an interest in me and got me to do a play. I got hooked on acting, and it gave me something constructive to do. I had a lot of energy.","When I grew into a teenager, I became obsessed with Marlon Brando, Montgomery Cliff, and James Dean.","'Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead' is one of the most underrated films. There were even different cuts of it. A wonderful film.","'The Waterdance' was made for all the right reasons. Everybody that was involved in the film gave it their all.","You can really do amazing things in a wheelchair. It's very dangerous if you don't know what you're doing, but you can even go up and down stairs in a wheelchair.","I really love Robert Duvall, who I think is maybe the best American actor. I love Robert Duvall because the ability that he has to change and do the most amazing work.","All of the punk-rock bands of the era would come in and play, and my job on Punk Rock Night was that I would go into the slam pit, and... I was 24 or 25, and I'd slam dance in the pit.","'Extreme Prejudice' is the last of the Mohicans. I don't think we'll ever see a film made like that again.","Warren Beatty is a great director. I wish Warren would direct another film right now, because I'd love to do another film with Warren. I think that 'Dick Tracy' is an outstanding film in its own right."],"William Frederick Book":["Never permit failure to become a habit.","A man must be master of his hours and days, not their servant.","A man must drive his energy, not be driven by it.","A man must earnestly want.","Learn to adjust yourself to the conditions you have to endure, but make a point of trying to alter or correct conditions so that they are most favorable to you.","The way to push things through to a finish effectively must be learned."],"William Friedkin":["Style is something that's extremely important, but it must grow naturally out of who and what you are and what the material calls for. It cannot be superimposed.","I tend to be attracted to characters who are up against a wall with very few alternatives. And the film then becomes an examination of how they cope with very few options. And that's, I guess, what interests me in terms of human behavior.","Violence is not funny.","I don't know about the rest of you, but I feel pressed and tense almost every day of my life about something or other. And I think it's the one thing, as I look into people's eyes, that I think I share with almost everybody.","The first work of the director is to set a mood so that the actor's work can take place, so that the actor can create. And in order to do that, you have to communicate, communicate with the actors. And direction is about communication on all levels.","I really think that sex always looks kind of funny in a movie.","Technique is of less interest than character and story.","The informing idea of what you want to say and do, that's what will take you from film school to professional - the idea.

And the worse it gets the more comic we are."],"William Gibson":["Time moves in one direction, memory in another.","The sky above the port was the color of television, tuned to a dead station.","The box was a universe, a poem, frozen on the boundaries of human experience.","The future has already arrived. It's just not evenly distributed yet.","I'm quite proud of what I anticipated about reality television from my books in the early '90s, which I based on the early seasons of 'Cops' and on the amazing stuff I had read about happening on Japanese shows and the British 'Big Brother'.","A graphic representation of data abstracted from the banks of every computer in the human system. Unthinkable complexity. Lines of light ranged in the nonspace of the mind, clusters and constellations of data. Like city lights, receding.","It's impossible to move, to live, to operate at any level without leaving traces, bits, seemingly meaningless fragments of personal information.","I think that technologies are morally neutral until we apply them. It's only when we use them for good or for evil that they become good or evil.","A snappy label and a manifesto would have been two of the very last things on my own career want list. That label enabled mainstream science fiction to safely assimilate our dissident influence, such as it was. Cyberpunk could then be embraced and given prizes and patted on the head, and genre science fiction could continue unchanged.","For years I have been mourning and not for my dead, it is for this boy for whatever corner in my heart died when his childhood slid out of my arms.","All we really have when we pretend to write about the future is the moment in which we are writing. That's why every imagined future obsoletes like an ice cream melting on the way back from the corner store.","Cyberspace. A consensual hallucination experienced daily by billions of legitimate operators, in every nation, by children being taught mathematical concepts.","And, for an instant, she stared directly into those soft blue eyes and knew, with an instinctive mammalian certainty, that the exceedingly rich were no longer even remotely human.","In 1981, I was a futurist - or at least I was a guy who put on a futurist hat occasionally - and I wrote about the 21st century.","I guess Twitter is the first thing that has been attractive to me as social media. I never felt the least draw to Facebook or MySpace. I've been involved anonymously in some tiny listservs, mainly in my ceaseless quest for random novelty, and sometimes while doing something that more closely resembles research.","Cyberspace is colonising what we used to think of as the real world. I think that our grandchildren will probably regard the distinction we make between what we call the real world and what they think of as simply the world as the quaintest and most incomprehensible thing about us.","The 'Net is a waste of time, and that's exactly what's right about it.","I've become convinced that nostalgia is a fundamentally unhealthy modality. When you see it, it's usually attached to something else that's really, seriously bad. I don't traffic in nostalgia. We're becoming a global culture.","I'm always interested in the spooky repurposing of everyday things.","I started with Apple, in a pre-Windows era when PCs seemed to involve more of a learning curve. But the fact that I'm yet to acquire so much as a single virus still seems a very good thing.","When I wrote 'Neuromancer', I had a list in my head of all the things the future was assumed to be which it would not be in the book I was about to write. In a sense, I intended 'Neuromancer', among other things, to be a critique of all the aspects of science fiction that no longer satisfied me.","The history of the past, a hundred years from now, won't be the history of the past that we learned in school because much more will have been revealed, and adjectives we can't even imagine will have been brought to bear on what we did learn in school.","The Internet is part of this ongoing, species-long project we've been working on since we climbed down out of the trees in the savanna. We've been working on it without really knowing it.","My dream scenario would be that you could go into a bookshop, examine copies of every book in print that they're able to offer, then for a fee have them produce in a minute or two a beautiful finished copy in a dust jacket that you would pay for and take home.","The thing that 'Neuromancer' predicts as being actually like the Internet isn't actually like the Internet at all!","Science fiction writers aren't fortune tellers. Fortune tellers are fakes.","I watch for emergent technologies and pay attention to what people say they'll be good for, then see what we actually use them for. It never occurred to me that a tiny telephone with a wireless transceiver would do whatever it is that it's done to us.","Gadgets are usually the last thing I think about, and if there's something new, I'll get to the store for the final shipment of the first generation when it's on sale. So I have last year's stuff.","I can't imagine writing a book without some strong female characters, unless that was a demand of the setting.","I assume that - because you can get degrees in journalism from very reputable universities - I assume that people can be trained to be journalists. I've never been entirely certain that anyone can be trained to be a novelist in the same way.","Generation X is dead. It has come to mean anyone aged 13 to 55 years old.","Why shouldn't we give our teachers a license to obtain software, all software, any software, for nothing? Does anyone demand a licensing fee, each time a child is taught the alphabet?","Dreaming in public is an important part of our job description, as science writers, but there are bad dreams as well as good dreams. We're dreamers, you see, but we're also realists, of a sort.","I don't have to write about the future. For most people, the present is enough like the future to be pretty scary.","Language is to the mind more than light is to the eye.","I didn't have a manifesto. I had some discontent. It seemed to me that midcentury mainstream American science fiction had often been triumphalist and militaristic, a sort of folk propaganda for American exceptionalism.","I think with one exception I've never changed an opening sentence after a book was completed.","I don't begin a novel with a shopping list - the novel becomes my shopping list as I write it.","Sometimes, I can myself be frustrated by books that seem to me to be insufficiently realistic about the world's potential for just being totally a randomly bad place.","I'm quite good friends with the putative director, Vincenzo Natali, and I'm a big fan of his work, but beyond that, I don't like to talk about other people's work work-in-progress.","All my life I've encountered people who were obsessed with one particular class of object or experience, who were constantly pursuing that thing. Since I was a little kid, I hadn't afforded myself the opportunity, I guess, to have a hobby.","That's one of my favorite things about Twitter: You can tweak your feed into a fabulous novelty engine. That's only one thing you can do with it, but it's one of the things I find most entertaining about it.","I don't think nostalgia is a healthy modality. But nostalgia and a sense of history are not the same thing. Nostalgia is a dysfunction of the historical impulse, or a corruption of the historical impulse.","I think the least important thing about science fiction for me is its predictive capacity.","In a sense, if you're not getting it wrong really a lot when you're creating imaginary futures, then you're just not doing it enough. You're not creating enough imaginary futures.","If you make something, it's an artifact. It's something that somebody or some corporate entity has caused to come into being. A great many human beings have thought about each of the artifacts that surround us. Different degrees of intelligence and attention have been brought to bear on anything.","I'm happiest with people who've gotten furthest from traditional ideas of nationalism.","The people I hang out with tend to use Macs, not that I think they're necessarily superior.","If I'm practicing making up what the characters will do, it's never good. In fact, when I catch myself doing that, I try to get rid of that section, and try and let them start making the decisions.","I don't generate a storyline and then fill it out in the course of writing. The story actually generates in the course of the writing. It's one of the reasons I've never been comfortable doing screenplays, because in order to get the contract for the screenplay, you have to sit down and tell them what's going to happen.","I find it interesting to see people - mostly people who are younger than I am - going to considerable trouble to try to reproduce things from an era that was far more physical, from a less virtual day.","Futurists get to a certain age and, as one does, they suddenly recognize their own mortality.","I was afraid to watch 'Blade Runner' in the theater because I was afraid the movie would be better than what I myself had been able to imagine. In a way, I was right to be afraid, because even the first few minutes were better.","I try to be objective about technology. Agnostic, in a sense. Whatever personal opinions I form tend to have more to do with what we find to do with the new thing.","I very seldom compose anything in my head which later finds its way into text, except character names sometimes - I'm often very much inspired by things that I misunderstand.","Occasionally if I look back at something I've written I'll find one of those that I don't understand, but that's a bad thing - the unconscious has dealt me a bad hand.","I think that our future has lost that capital F we used to spell it with. The science fiction future of my childhood has had a capital F - it was assumed to be an American Future because America was the future. The Future was assumed to be inherently heroic, and a lot of other things, as well.","I'm interested in how people all over the world array themselves and go forth in the morning to do whatever they have to do to make a living.","Whenever I read a contemporary literary novel that describes the world we're living in, I wait for the science fiction tools to come out. Because they have to - the material demands it.","As a writer of fiction who deals with technology, I necessarily deal with the history of technology and the history of technologically induced social change. I roam up and down it in a kind of special way because I roam down it into history, which is invariably itself a speculative affair.","I think the large part of the function of the Internet is it is archival. It's unreliable to the extent that word on the street is unreliable. It's no more unreliable than that. You can find the truth on the street if you work at it. I don't think of the Internet or the virtual as being inherently inferior to the so-called real.","The ecological impact of book manufacture and traditional book marketing - I think that should really be considered. We have this industry in which we cut down trees to make the paper that we then use enormous amounts of electricity to turn into books that weigh a great deal and are then shipped enormous distances to point-of-sale retail.","'Cyberspace' as a term is sort of over. It's over in the way that, after a certain time, people stopped using the suffix '-electro' to make things cool, because everything was electrical. 'Electro' was all over the early 20th century, and now it's gone. I think 'cyber' is sort of the same way.","I'm often saddened and dismayed to see myself portrayed as either a Luddite or as a raving technophile. I've always thought that my job was to be as anthropologically neutral about emerging technologies as possible.","I don't much live my life as if I was living in a Raymond Chandler novel, which is probably a good thing.","I grew up in southwestern Virginia. I was born in South Carolina, but only because my parents had a vacation cabin or something there on the beach. I was like a summer baby. But I did grow up in the South. I grew up in serious, serious Appalachia, in a very small town.","If I write something set 60 years in the future, I am going to have to explain how humanity got there, and that's becoming quite a big job.","When I start writing a novel, I have no sense of direction, no idea, really nothing.","I started writing short fiction very briefly, as I imagine is the case for some novelists.","I like the idea of people who've had some success in one form secretly wanting to be something else; I have some of that myself. I look for it in other people who've established themselves in some particular art form, and then you find out that they really would like to design running shoes, or edit literary magazines or something.","I would like to design what people generally call streetwear. I'd like to dress skateboarders, or whatever the older equivalent of skateboarders are. I pay more attention to that stuff than anyone would ever imagine because I'm watching what the designers do.","I've been interested in autism since I've known about it, which is more or less since I've been writing.","I can't do fiction unless I visualize what's going on. When I began to write science fiction, one of the things I found lacking in it was visual specificity. It seemed there was a lot of lazy imagining, a lot of shorthand.","I read a great deal of science fiction with consummate pleasure between, say, the ages of 12 and 16. Then I got away from it. In my mid- to late 20s, I started trying to write it.","I think the least important thing about science fiction for me is its predictive capacity. Its record for being accurately predictive is really, really poor! If you look at the whole history of science fiction, what people have said is going to happen, what writers have said is going to happen, and what actually happened - it's terrible.","If you've read a lot of vintage science fiction, as I have at one time or another in my life, you can't help but realise how wrong we get it. I have gotten it wrong more times than I've gotten it right. But I knew that when I started; I knew that before I wrote a word of science fiction.","Science fiction was one of those places, particularly during the McCarthy era, where you could write whatever you wanted because it was beneath contempt. They didn't bother censoring it.","I'd always maintained that much of the anarchy and craziness of the early Internet had a lot to do with the fact that governments just hadn't realised it was there.","I'm a really good eavesdropper. I listen to what people say and remember all the buzzwords.","I'm not a computer guy. I'm like an anthropologist. I'm fascinated with people's obsessions. I've learned to wear them.","In the early '80s, I happened to find myself in the vicinity of people who would work for Microsoft five years later.","I've never really been very interested in computers themselves. I don't watch them; I watch how people behave around them. That's becoming more difficult to do because everything is around them.","I'm a reluctant writer of non-fiction, in part because I don't really feel qualified."],"William Gilbert":["When everyone is somebody, then no one's anybody.","In the discovery of secret things and in the investigation of hidden causes, stronger reasons are obtained from sure experiments and demonstrated arguments than from probable conjectures and the opinions of philosophical speculators of the common sort.","Man is nature's sole mistake.","If you wish in this world to advance your merits you're bound to enhance; You must stir it and stump it, and blow your own trumpet, Or, trust me, you haven't a chance.","The House of Peers, throughout the war, did nothing in particular, and did it very well.","I always voted at my party's call, and I never thought of thinking for myself at all.","You have no idea what a poor opinion I have of myself and how little I deserve it.","We will hang you, never fear, Most politely, most politely.","No one can have a higher opinion of him than I have, and I think he's a dirty little beast.","He combines the manners of a Marquis with the morals of a Methodist.","And I always voted at my party's call, and I never thought of thinking for myself at all.","Philosophy is for the few.","My family pride is something inconceivable.

Whenever civilization pauses in the march of conquest, it is overthrown by the barbarian.","No errors of opinion can possibly be dangerous in a country where opinion is left free to grapple with them.","Not in sorrow freely is never to open the bosom to the sweets of the sunshine.","Genius is the very eye of intellect and the wing of thought; it is always in advance of its time, and is the pioneer for the generation which it precedes."],"William Glasser":["Education is the process in which we discover that learning adds quality to our lives. Learning must be experienced.","We are driven by five genetic needs: survival, love and belonging, power, freedom, and fun.","If you want to change attitudes, start with a change in behavior.","What happened in the past that was painful has a great deal to do with what we are today, but revisiting this painful past can contribute little or nothing to what we need to do now.","We can pay teachers a hundred thousand dollars a year, and we'll do nothing to improve our schools as long as we keep the A, B, C, D, F grading system.","I think education is both using and improving knowledge and that changes the whole picture.","To counter the avoidance of intellectual challenge and responsibility, we must reduce the domination of certainty in education.","No human being will work hard at anything unless they believe that they are working for competence.","Using no control and using humor will build a relationship and make a dent to where the client puts the counselor in their quality world and then begins to relate and seek out the counselor. Effective therapy begins with the acceptance of the therapist into the client's quality world.","It is almost impossible for anyone, even the most ineffective among us, to continue to choose misery after becoming aware that it is a choice.","Good or bad, everything we do is our best choice at that moment.","If you improve education by teaching for competence, eliminating schooling, and connecting with students, the test scores will improve.","Too many of us fail to fulfill our needs because we say no rather than yes, or perhaps later in life, yes when we should say no.","We may be up against a stone wall, but we don't have to bloody our heads against it unless we choose to.","You can acquire a lot of knowledge without ever going to school.","In a Glasser Quality School there is no such thing as a closed book test. Students are told to get out their notes and open their books. There is no such thing as being forbidden to ask the teacher or another student for help.","When we label anyone 'bad', we will have more trouble dealing with him than if we could have settled for a lesser label.","Caring for but never trying to own may be a further way to define friendship.","As long as acquiring knowledge is the educational goal of schools, educational opportunities will be limited, as they are now, to affluent families.","Since there will be no one left to talk peace after the next war, it makes good sense to break with tradition and hold the peace conference first.","If we had in this room a hundred teachers, good teachers from good schools, and asked them to define the word education, there would be very little general agreement.","Every single major push in education has made it worse and right now it's really bad because everything we've done is de-humanizing education. It's destroying the possibility of the teacher and the student having a warm, friendly, intellectual relationship.","To be depressed or neurotic is passive. It happened to us; we are its victim, and we have no control over it.","Effective teaching may be the hardest job there is.","Everybody needs one essential friend.","Without pay, no human being will work up to their ability if he or she is not cared for and respected.","What students lack in school is an intellectual relationship or conversation with the teacher.","We don't focus as much in schools on educational knowledge which requires thinking and application, as we do on acquiring facts.","We can teach a lot of things, but if the teacher can't relate by talking to a group of friendly students, he'll never be a competent teacher.","We almost always have choices, and the better the choice, the more we will be in control of our lives.","Told that the passing grade is a B or competence and that we will help you to get there, students do competent work. The lowest passing grade in the real world is competence. Why do schools accept so much less?","This is at the heart of all good education, where the teacher asks students to think and engages them in encouraging dialogues, constantly checking for understanding and growth.","There is plenty of competition in a Glasser Quality School in that there is winning but no losing.","There are only two places in the world where time takes precedence over the job to be done. School and prison.","Running a school where the students all succeed, even if some students have to help others to make the grade, is good preparation for democracy.","Prior to being allowed to enter the profession, prospective teachers should be asked to talk with a group of friendly students for at least half an hour and be able to engage them in an interesting conversation about any subject the prospective teacher wants to talk about.","I think it is totally wrong and terribly harmful if education is defined as acquiring knowledge.","Don't marry someone you would not be friends with if there was no sex between you.","Sex is on the minds of most people, especially those who shouldn't be having it.","If everyone could learn that what is right for me does not make it right for anyone else, the world would be a much happier place.","The faster you go, the more students you leave behind. It doesn't matter how much or how fast you teach. The true measure is how much students have learned.","When we depress, we believe we are the victims of a feeling over which we have no control.","They have this big book called the 'DSM-IV,' you know, that is supposedly written about crazy people, but I think it is a book that is written by crazy people!"],"William Godwin":["No man knows the value of innocence and integrity but he who has lost them.","He that loves reading has everything within his reach.","What are gold and jewels and precious utensils? Mere dross and dirt. The human face and the human heart, reciprocations of kindness and love, and all the nameless sympathies of our nature - these are the only objects worth being attached to.","Religion is among the most beautiful and most natural of all things - that religion which 'sees God in clouds and hears Him in the wind,' which endows every object of sense with a living soul, which finds in the system of nature whatever is holy, mysterious and venerable, and inspires the bosom with sentiments of awe and veneration.","A just and a brave man acts fearlessly and with explicitness; he does not shun, but court, the scrutiny of mankind; he lives in the face of day, and the whole world confesses the clearness of his spirit and the rectitude of his conduct.","It is indeed specially characteristic of the passion of love that it has the faculty of giving a perpetual flow to the interchange of sentiments and reflections in conversation.","Justice is the sum of all moral duty.","What can be more clear and sound in explanation, than the love of a parent to his child?","Superior virtue must be the fruit of superior intelligence.","It is one of the oldest maxims of moral prudence: Do not, by aspiring to what is impracticable, lose the opportunity of doing the good you can effect!","There can be no passion, and by consequence no love, where there is not imagination.","The philosophy of the wisest man that ever existed, is mainly derived from the act of introspection.","Above all we should not forget that government is an evil, a usurpation upon the private judgement and individual conscience of mankind.","Perseverance is an active principle, and cannot continue to operate but under the influence of desire.","I know not how it is: there are some businesses for which dullness seems to be a qualification.","How are the faculties of man to be best developed and his happiness secured? The state of a king is not favorable to this, nor the state of the noble and rich men of the earth. All this is artificial life, the inventions of vanity and grasping ambition, by which we have spoiled the man of nature and of pure, simple, and undistorted impulses.","Extraordinary circumstances often bring along with them extraordinary strength. No man knows, till the experiment, what he is capable of effecting.","The most desirable state of mankind is that which maintains general security with the smallest encroachment upon individual independence.","Revolutions are the produce of passion, not of sober and tranquil reason.","Government will not fail to employ education, to strengthen its hands, and perpetuate its institutions.","I know nothing worth the living for but usefulness and the service of my fellow-creatures. The only object I pursue is to increase, as far as lies in my power, the quantity of their knowledge and goodness and happiness.","Without imagination, there can be no genuine ardor in any pursuit or for any acquisition, and without imagination, there can be no genuine morality, no profound feeling of other men's sorrow, no ardent and persevering anxiety for their interests.","Self-deception is so far from impossible that it is one of the most ordinary phenomena with which we are acquainted. Nothing is more usual than for a man to impute his actions to honorable motives when it is nearly demonstrable that they flowed from some corrupt and contemptible force.","When the calamity we feared is already arrived, or when the expectation of it is so certain as to shut out hope, there seems to be a principle within us by which we look with misanthropic composure on the state to which we are reduced, and the heart sullenly contracts and accommodates itself to what it most abhorred.","Man is the only creature we know, that, when the term of his natural life is ended, leaves the memory of himself behind him.","The proper method for hastening the decay of error is by teaching every man to think for himself.","I never did, and I never will, thank any man for altering any one word of my compositions without my privity.","If he who employs coercion against me could mould me to his purposes by argument, no doubt he would. He pretends to punish me because his argument is strong; but he really punishes me because his argument is weak.","The evils that arise to us from the structure of the material universe are neither trivial nor few, yet the history of political society sufficiently shows that man is, of all other beings, the most formidable enemy to man.","There must be room for the imagination to exercise its powers; we must conceive and apprehend a thousand things which we do not actually witness.","Make men wise, and by that very operation you make them free. Civil liberty follows as a consequence of this; no usurped power can stand against the artillery of opinion.","Study with desire is real activity; without desire it is but the semblance and mockery of activity.","Every man has a certain sphere of discretion which he has a right to expect shall not be infringed by his neighbours. This right flows from the very nature of man.","During my academical life, and from this time forward, I was indefatigable in my search after truth. I read all the authors of greatest repute, for and against the Trinity, original sin, and the most disputed doctrines, but I was not yet of an understanding sufficiently ripe for impartial decision, and all my inquiries terminated in Calvinism.","I was famous in our college for calm and impassionate discussion; for one whole summer, I rose at five and went to bed at midnight, that I might have sufficient time for theology and metaphysics.","The four principal oral instructors to whom I feel my mind indebted for improvement were Joseph Fawcet, Thomas Holcroft, George Dyson, and Samuel Taylor Coleridge.","Harshness and unkindness are relative. The appearance of them may be the fruits of the greatest kindness.","Government was intended to suppress injustice, but its effect has been to embody and perpetuate it.","We covet experience; we have a secret desire to learn, not from cold prohibition, but from trial, whether those things, which are not without a semblance of good, are really so ill as they are described to us.","The true key of the universe is love.","Let no man despise the oracles of books! A book is a dead man, a sort of mummy, embowelled and embalmed, but that once had flesh and motion and a boundless variety of determinations and actions.","It is the misfortune of those who are concerned in conducting human affairs that, however pure and capacious their own conceptions may be, they must accommodate themselves to the circumstances with which they are environed and use the instruments that are within their reach.","Was ever a great discovery prosecuted or an important benefit conferred upon the human race by him who was incapable of standing and thinking and feeling alone?","Social man regards all those by whom he is surrounded as enemies, or beings who may become such. He is ever on his guard lest his plain speaking should be willfully perverted, or should assume a meaning he never thought of, through the animosity or prejudice of the individual that hears him.","Love conquers all difficulties, surmounts all obstacles, and effects what to any other power would be impossible.","I am now in the full maturity of my age and vigor of my mind. Persons of various descriptions have repeatedly solicited me to turn my mind to dramatical composition. It was, indeed, the first amusement of my thoughts in my school-boy cell.","God is a being who is himself the cause of his own existence. His prerogative is to perceive before there was anything to be perceived. He is the creator of the universe; He operated upon nothing and turned it into something.","In contemplation and reverie, one thought introduces another perpetually; and it is by similarity, or the hooking of one upon the other, that the process of thinking is carried on.","Tenderness is the name for a lover's most exquisite sensation; protection is implied in his most generous and heart-thrilling impulse.","God himself has no right to be a tyrant.","But the watchful care of the parent is endless. The youth is never free from the danger of grating interference.","As the true object of education is not to render the pupil the mere copy of his preceptor, it is rather to be rejoiced in, than lamented, that various reading should lead him into new trains of thinking.","It is probable that there is no one thing that it is of eminent importance for a child to learn.","We cannot perform our tasks to the best of our power, unless we think well of our own capacity.","In cases where every thing is understood, and measured, and reduced to rule, love is out of the question.","The great model of the affection of love in human beings is the sentiment which subsists between parents and children.","The execution of any thing considerable implies in the first place previous persevering meditation.","Let us not, in the eagerness of our haste to educate, forget all the ends of education.","If a thing be really good, it can be shown to be such.","Everything understood by the term co-operation is in some sense an evil.","There is reverence that we owe to everything in human shape.","Learning is the ally, not the adversary of genius... he who reads in a proper spirit, can scarcely read too much.","What indeed is life, unless so far as it is enjoyed? It does not merit the name.","The lessons of their early youth regulated the conduct of their riper years.","My thoughts will be taken up with the future or the past, with what is to come or what has been. Of the present there is necessarily no image.","The cause of justice is the cause of humanity. Its advocates should overflow with universal good will. We should love this cause, for it conduces to the general happiness of mankind.","The diligent scholar is he that loves himself, and desires to have reason to applaud and love himself.","One of the prerogatives by which man is eminently distinguished from all other living beings inhabiting this globe of earth, consists in the gift of reason.","Revolution is engendered by an indignation with tyranny, yet is itself pregnant with tyranny.","The real or supposed rights of man are of two kinds, active and passive; the right in certain cases to do as we list; and the right we possess to the forbearance or assistance of other men.","He has no right to his life when his duty calls him to resign it. Other men are bound... to deprive him of life or liberty, if that should appear in any case to be indispensably necessary to prevent a greater evil.","A world of derived beings, an immense, wide creation, requires an extended scale with various ranks and orders of existence.","Human depravity originates in the vices of political constitution.","I believe in this being, not because I have any proper or direct knowledge of His existence, but I am at a loss to account for the existence and arrangement of the visible universe, and, being left in the wide sea of conjecture without a clue from analogy or experience, I find the conjecture of a God easy, obvious, and irresistible.","I am an enemy to revolutions. I abhor, both from temper and from the clearest judgment I am able to form, all violent convulsions in the affairs of men.","It is of no consequence whether a man of genius have learned either art or science before twenty-five: all that is necessary, or even desirable, is that his powers should be unfolded, his emulation roused, and his habits conducted into a right channel.","Give energy, and mental exertion will always have attraction enough.","The love of independence and dislike of unjust treatment is the source of a thousand virtues.","In the two novels I have published, it was my fortune at different times, and from different persons, to hear the most unqualified censure long before it was possible for me to hear the voice of the public. But my temper was not altered, nor my courage subdued.","Human creatures, living in the circle of their intimates and friends, are too apt to remain in ignorance of the comments and instructions which may be made of what they say and do in the world at large. I entertain a great horror of this ignorance.","I am most peremptorily of opinion against putting children extremely forward. If they desire it themselves, I would not balk them, for I love to attend to these unsophisticated indications. But otherwise, 'festina lente' is my maxim in education.","My temper is of a recluse and contemplative cast; had it been otherwise, I should, perhaps, on some former occasions, have entered into the active concerns of the world and not have been connected with it merely as a writer of books.","England has been called, with great felicity of conception, 'the land of liberty and good sense.' We have preserved many of the advantages of a free people, which the nations of the Continent have long since lost.","I was brought up in great tenderness, and though my mind was proud to independence, I was never led to much independence of feeling.","While my mother lived, I always felt to a certain degree as if I had somebody who was my superior and who exercised a mysterious protection over me. I belonged to something - I hung to something - there is nothing that has so much reverence and religion in it as affection to parents.","Till 1782, I believed in the doctrine of Calvin: that is, that the majority of mankind were objects of divine condemnation and that their punishment would be everlasting. The 'Systeme de la Nature,' read about the beginning of that year, changed my opinion and made me a Deist.","With respect to my religious sentiments, I have the firmest assurance and tranquillity. I have faithfully endeavoured to improve the faculties and opportunities God has given me, and I am perfectly easy about the consequences.","In the summer of 1791, I gave up my concern in the 'New Annual Register,' the historical part of which I had written for seven years, and abdicated, I hope forever, the task of performing a literary labour, the nature of which should be dictated by anything but the promptings of my own mind.","We have, all of us, our duties. Every action of our lives, and every word that we utter, will either conduce to or detract from the discharge of our duty.","We cannot, any of us, do all the things of which mankind stand in need; we must have fellow-labourers.","The true object of moral and political disquisition is pleasure or happiness.","Government, as it was forced upon mankind by their vices, so has it commonly been the creature of their ignorance and mistake.","Duty is that mode of action which constitutes the best application of the capacity of the individual to the general advantage.","The extent of our progress in the cultivation of knowledge is unlimited.","Soundness of understanding is connected with freedom of enquiry; consequently, opinion should, as far as public security will admit, be exempted from restraint.","When we look on the roses and gaiety of youth, the mournful idea of mortality is altogether alien to our thoughts. We have heard of it as a speculation and a tale, but nothing but experience can bring it home to us.","Innocence is not virtue. Virtue demands the active employment of an ardent mind in the promotion of the general good. No man can be eminently virtuous who is not accustomed to an extensive range of reflection.","The question now afloat in the world respecting 'things as they are' is the most interesting that can be presented to the human mind. While one party pleads for reformation and change, the other extols in the warmest terms the existing constitution of society.","Act up to the magnitude of your destiny.","The world is all alike. Those that seem better than their neighbours are only more artful. They mean the same thing, though they take a different road.","How different a creature is man in society and man in solitude!","Man is a being of a mixed nature; and, as there is no integrity without its flaws, so is there no man so knavish but that in some things he may be trusted.","Religion is the most important of all things: the great point of discrimination that divides the man from the brute. It is our special prerogative that we can converse with that which we cannot see and believe in that the existence of which is reported to us by none of our senses.","Invisible things are the only realities; invisible things alone are the things that shall remain.","What is there so offensive to which habit has not the power to reconcile us?","In infamy, it is wisely provided that he who stands highest in the ranks of society has the heaviest load to sustain.","Sympathy is one of the principles most widely rooted in our nature: we rejoice to see ourselves reflected in another; and, perversely enough, we sometimes have a secret pleasure in seeing the sin which dwells in ourselves existing under a deformed and monstrous aspect in another.","What is high birth to him to whom high birth has never been the theme of his contemplation? What is a throne to him who has never dreamed of a throne?","Occupation - pressing occupation that will not be said nay - is a sovereign remedy for grief.","The Italian character in general is full of animation, and the natives enter into the interests and welfare of the stranger before them with a fervor that forbids all doubt of its sincerity and that is truly surprising.","The man who plays his part upon the theatre of life almost always maintains what may be called an artificial character.","Every boy learns more in his hours of play than in his hours of labor. In school, he lays in the materials of thinking, but in his sports, he actually thinks: he whets his faculties, and he opens his eyes.","The mind of a child is no less vagrant than his steps; it pursues the gossamer and flies from object to object, lawless and unconfined, and it is equally necessary to the development of his frame that his thoughts and his body should be free from fetters.","Perhaps the majority of human beings never think of standing by themselves, and choosing their own employments, till the sentence has been regularly promulgated to them, 'It is time for you to take care of yourself.'","Enthusiasm is always an interesting spectacle. When it expresses itself with an honest and artless eloquence, it is difficult to listen to it and not, in some degree, to catch the flame.","There are so many ways in which the heart of man conceals itself from man!","The soul of man is one of those subtle and evanescent substances that, as long as they remain still, the organ of sight does not remark; it must become agitated to become visible.","Woe to the man who is always busy - hurried in a turmoil of engagements, from occupation to occupation, and with no seasons interposed of recollection, contemplation and repose! Such a man must inevitably be gross and vulgar, and hard and indelicate - the sort of man with whom no generous spirit would desire to hold intercourse.","How nations and races of men are to be so governed as may be most conducive to the improvement and happiness of all is one of the most interesting questions that can be offered to our consideration.","The admission of one man, either hereditarily or for life only, into the place of chief of a country, is an evidence of the infirmity of man. Nature has set up no difference between a king and other men; a king, therefore, is purely the creation of our own hands.","No one can display or can cultivate a fervent zeal in the mere repetition of a form.","We cannot do justice to the deeds of former times if we do not in some degree remove ourselves from the circumstances in which we stand and substitute those by which the real actors were surrounded.","Great changes cannot take place in the minds of generations of men without a corresponding change in their external symbols. There must be a harmony between the inner and the outward condition of human beings, and the progress of the one must keep pace with the progress of the other.","It is questionless desirable in all ordinary cases, wherever positive law is established, to restrain ourselves within the letter of that law and to allow the criminal all the benefit, if benefit to him shall result, of any evasion or escape that the law shall afford him.","Law is made for man and not man for the law. Wherever we can be sure that the most valuable interests of a nation require that we should decide one way, that way we ought to decide.","Men who do not contend in earnest can have little warmth and fervor in what they undertake, and are more than half prepared to betray the cause, in the vindication of which they have engaged their services.","Since it is one of the great attributes of our species to be susceptible of improvement and capable of experiencing the most beneficial changes, for this reason what are vulgarly called 'venerable establishments' will often range themselves in opposition to the best interests of the community.","There is nothing that human imagination can figure brilliant and enviable that human genius and skill do not aspire to realize.","It is necessary for him who would endure existence with patience that he should conceive himself to be something - that he should be persuaded he is not a cipher in the muster-roll of man.","To diminish the cases in which the assistance of others is felt absolutely necessary is the only genuine road to independence.","The value of a man is in his intrinsic qualities: in that of which power cannot strip him and which adverse fortune cannot take away. That for which he is indebted to circumstances is mere trapping and tinsel.","Everything in the world is conducted by gradual process. This seems to be the great principle of harmony in the universe.","In the graver and more sentimental communication of man and man, the head still bears the superior sway; in the unreserved intimacies of man and woman, the heart is ever uppermost. Feeling is the main thing, and judgment passes for little.","Hope is in some respects a thing more brilliant, more vivifying, than fruition. What we have looked forward to with eager and earnest aspiration is never in all respects equal to the picture we had formed of it. The very uncertainty enhances the enjoyment.","There is an indescribable something that ties us to life. For this purpose, it is not necessary that we should be happy. Though our life be almost without enjoyment, we do not consent to part with it.","There is a class of persons whose souls are essentially non-conductors to the electricity of sentiment, and whose minds seem to be filled with their own train of thinking, convictions, and purposes to the exclusion of everything else.","There is scarcely an instant that passes over our heads that may not have its freight of infamy. How ought we to watch over our thoughts, that we may not so much as imagine any enormity!"],"William Golding":["Before the Second World War, I believed in the perfectability of social man; that a correct structure of society produced goodwill; and that, therefore, you could remove all social ills by a reorganisation of society. It is possible that I believe something of the same again; but after the war, I did not because I was unable to.","A novel ensures that we can look before and after, take action at whatever pace we choose, read again and again, skip and go back. The story in a book is humble and serviceable, available, friendly, is not switched on and off but taken up and put down, lasts a lifetime.","Man produces evil as a bee produces honey.","I think women are foolish to pretend they are equal to men; they are far superior and always have been.","The journey of life is like a man riding a bicycle. We know he got on the bicycle and started to move. We know that at some point he will stop and get off. We know that if he stops moving and does not get off he will fall off.","I must have been an unsatisfactory child for grownups to deal with. I remember how incomprehensible they appeared to me at first, but not, of course, how I appeared to them.","Childhood is a disease - a sickness that you grow out of.","We've got to have rules and obey them. After all, we're not savages. We're English, and the English are best at everything.","What a man does defiles him, not what is done by others.","Boys do not evaluate a book. They divide books into categories. There are sexy books, war books, westerns, travel books, science fiction. A boy will accept anything from a section he knows rather than risk another sort. He has to have the label on the bottle to know it is the mixture as before.","When I wrote 'Lord of the Flies' - I had no idea it would even get published.","Novelists do not write as birds sing, by the push of nature. It is part of the job that there should be much routine and some daily stuff on the level of carpentry.","He who rides the sea of the Nile must have sails woven of patience.","If you... scaled down human beings, scaled down society, if you land with a group of little boys, they are more like a scaled-down version of society than a group of little girls would be.","I have always understood the Nazis because I am of that sort by nature.","My yesterdays walk with me. They keep step, they are gray faces that peer over my shoulder.","Sleep is when all the unsorted stuff comes flying out as from a dustbin upset in a high wind.","I'd rather there wasn't an afterlife, really. I'd much rather not be me for thousands of years.","Marx, Darwin and Freud are the three most crashing bores of the Western World. Simplistic popularization of their ideas has thrust our world into a mental straitjacket from which we can only escape by the most anarchic violence.","While I was still a boy, I came to the conclusion that there were three grades of thinking; and since I was later to claim thinking as my hobby, I came to an even stranger conclusion - namely, that I myself could not think at all.","Language fits over experience like a straight-jacket.","The writer probably knows what he meant when he wrote a book, but he should immediately forget what he meant when he's written it.","Utopias are presented for our inspection as a critique of the human state.","I have been in many countries, and I have found there people examining their own love of life, sense of peril, their own common sense. The one thing they cannot understand is why that same love of life, sense of peril and above all common sense, is not invariably shared among their leaders and rulers.","I am optimistic when I consider the spiritual dimension which the scientist's discipline forces him to ignore.","Since most scientists are just a bit religious, and most religious are seldom wholly unscientific, we find humanity in a comical position. His scientific intellect believes in the possibility of miracles inside a black hole, while his religious intellect believes in them outside it."],"William Goldman":["Nobody knows anything.","Being a screenwriter is not enough for a full creative life.","Life is pain, highness. Anyone who tells you differently is selling something.","Life isn't fair. It's just fairer than death, that's all.","We are men of action, lies do not become us.","The easiest thing to do on earth is not write.","But this is life on earth, you can't have everything.","You can never trust what you read.","As far as the filmmaking process is concerned, stars are essentially worthless - and absolutely essential.","One way an author dies a little each day is when his books go out of print.","Yes, I am a failed playwright. I had three shows on Broadway by the time I was 30. They all flopped, and I fled.","There is one crucial rule that must be followed in all creative meetings. Never speak first.

That does not mean that the shapes are unimportant, but rather that the older methods could not define them.","Let us think of Nature as a builder, making all that we see out of atoms of a limited number of kinds, just as the builder of a house constructs it out of so many different kinds of things: bricks, slates, planks, panes of glass, and so on.","Whenever we warm our hands by the fire, we allow the energy radiated by the fire to quicken up the movements of the atoms of which the hands are composed. When we cool any substance, we check those movements.","Sound is a movement which is handed on from atom to atom in a gas through which the sound is passing, just as a chain of workers pass buckets of water to a fire. The quicker the workers move their hands and arms, the quicker the water moves.","When a liquid boils, the temperature has been raised to such a pitch that the evaporating molecules are sufficient in number and speed to lift off the air from the surface of the liquid and push it back en masse.","The infinite variety in the properties of the solid materials we find in the world is really the expression of the infinite variety of the ways in which the atoms and molecules can be tied together, and of the strength of those ties."],"William Henry Danforth":["Certainly, the emergence of Enterprise Rent-A-Car and the Taylor family has been one of the great things that has happened in St. Louis.

And the more I know it, the more amazed I am by being here at all.","I am so thrilled by the privilege of life, and yet at the same time I know that I have to let it go.","I've been delighted by Cannes and Toronto but I keep saying I don't know how good we're going to be received in America because that's where it's most challenging.","David Cronenberg knows what we actors do as artists.","The thing is David is also aware of everything and it's not like you're going somewhere the director is not.","I very much prefer the balance in a scene to standing out and so you have to make a decision.","People who have expertise or the luck to have rehearsal time with cameras have it over people who don't.","Heroes to me are guys that sit in libraries. They absorb knowledge and then the risks they take are calculated on the basis of the courage it took to become replete with knowledge.","It was the moment I learned acting is not acting out. After that light went on, I spent the rest of my life trying to figure out how to make other people realize it.","I want to prove a point. That point is, actors are artists, not narcissists necessarily.","Not to be offensive, not to be capricious, not to be arbitrary, not to be neurotic, not to be an actor outer, you're just trying to get in and you're given so little time to get in gently, but it's always hard.","I need six weeks of rehearsal and women need nine months and it took me 15 years to figure that out.","The thing is, I don't believe in most of what's done. The amount of financial and imaginative energy that's put into mediocrity is just amazing which I find to be fundamentally offensive as a human being.","It just seems like that because I do a lot of independent films that don't get to the mainstream.","I demand minimal for paid rehearsal and not always six weeks either.","I have a film I want to direct. Gena Rowlands was going to do it with me a long time ago. It's about an older woman who's running a ranch in the west the old fashioned way.","I listen to XM radio because I can get so many overseas news stations.","What's really frustrating with movies is the lack of improvement.","I know what I love about acting - and it's the creative process.","If you're lucky, and not a lot of actors are these days, you get the chance to create a character.","I think acting can bring you closer to yourself and help you understand other people.","The perfection in theater is that it's over the second it's done.","Sometimes people call me a success for all the reasons that make me think I'm a failure.","Being famous is not something that would make me feel successful - unless one was striving for mediocrity.","I was held hostage and almost executed by a man who was robbing us in the middle of the night.","I just looked at him because I want to be looking in someone's eyes when I die.","I was a science fiction junkie for a long time.","The enemies of acting are mood and attitude and other general homogenized disruptive entities. Whereas acting is about action - doing - and unless you can figure out a way to craft in an imaginative reality to which you don't submit, you're going to be out of control. You'll flip out. The job is to be surprised.","We'd like to prearrange our life on all levels. We'd prefer it to be scripted. But it's not.","The funnel of deep feeling and profound satisfaction in life comes from the capacity to feel.","I was very lucky when I was a kid - I travelled a lot and spent a lot of time in Africa, Asia and Europe. I also chant in Sanskrit.","I am just as comfortable in Britain and France as I am in America... but nowhere is perfect.","I don't have any artifacts of my profession in my house; the Oscar is in storage.","The problem with Google is you have 360 degrees of omnidirectional information on a linear basis, but the algorithms for irony and ambiguity are not there. And those are the algorithms of wisdom.","The irony is that the more specific you are in the portrayal of character, the more like other people you are. In the same way, the more you think about how alone you are in this life, you realise how much a brother and sister everyone else is.","Fame... it's been a challenge, let's put it that way. It's a privilege and a responsibility, and I'm not sure I carried the responsibility well at times, which is embarrassing. And I've had to look and be disappointed in myself occasionally for how I behaved in some circumstances.","My greatest offering is my concept. It isn't my face.","Every single second of extra time to work with other actors has definitely always, for me, paid off for the film. For the project. Every single extra heartbeat you could get, mutually considering the scene, was of benefit.","You get older, and people start passing away. And so if you're lucky - my mom died very young, for instance, and I have friends who died very young - but the point being that, I think if you're awake, you know you're going to pass on. And that the real treasure in life is the long term - relationships that you really value.","For as privileged an actor as I have been, TV as a standard is short shrift. They have to do it so quickly that they don't stop and take a look. They just shoot. So that's one of the reasons I typically stay away from it. I think art is an act of consideration, and if you're not considering, I don't think you're really doing mankind a favor.","When you are a kid, you are beset by fears, and you think, 'I'll solve the fear by living forever and becoming a movie star.'","I am constantly asked, 'What's the difference between acting in the theater and acting in film?' The only answer I can give is the space - you adapt to the space. But acting is acting.","I have never worked with anyone who I hold in higher esteem than Chris Menges. He's an absolute, bona fide, authentic artist.","The thrill of acting is the discovery part, so it all changes, but it has to change in a way that fits what is written. You can't just wander off and get interested in your own tangent.","Woody Allen asked me to improv once. I said no.","I'm not there to tailor the role to me: I'm there to tailor me to the role. That guarantees me something, a precious thing, which is creativity. I'm guaranteed that I will have a creative experience, because I will go to it, not demand that it comes to me.","I'm an actor. I play roles in films and theaters. I don't act out, and I don't play people.","My first cousin, by the way, on my father's mother side was John Marshall Harlan, who was a Supreme Court justice, as was his grandson. And I think a lot of my fight and my work to struggle for fairness and the techniques of theater and in subject matter probably stems in some way from some sense I have of his issues in life.","I live in the county where my mother was born and buried.","I grew up in the South Pacific. Basically, my brothers were Guamanian. I spoke words of Guamanian long before I spoke words of English, and so I've seen a lot. You know, I've traveled in places where people don't have the benefits of American life. And so I've seen a lot of stuff.","Post-adolescence reaches usually into the late 30s.","Where did I study? I went to P.S. 6. I went to Collegiate, Middlesex, Tufts, Juilliard.","I like to work. I'm glad; I'm privileged to have work.","I'm not going to party. I'm going to go do something that will make me break a sweat.","If you don't exercise, you don't stay strong. I like to work with talented people.","Play is play, fun is fun, and work is work. They're different. I work hard; even if it's supposed to be fun for someone else, it's work for me.","I generally try to think of what it is I want to express and then find a way of expressing it.","I didn't study interviews. I studied acting.","We get so intellectual that we forget that we're physical creatures.","I've made a couple of films that were a little too wide and non-specific - like 'The Doctor.'","I don't want my children to have to wade through the crap to get to the cream, you know. I want them to be aware that I struggled to live with and tell my truth, and that it was a decent thing.","I'm coming from the notion that acting is an art. It is not a business. It is about building characters, not about selling personalities.","I have a way of synthesizing. That's what I would encourage any young person to do: take in the ideas, the conflicts, and the world. Watch and listen and live before you go public.","Celebrity is a pathological sickness of the culture. Narcissists on screen being consumed by narcissists off-screen.","I had great qualms about playing a man who was living. I've never met Walt McCandless, and I never will."],"William Irwin Thompson":["Hominid and human evolution took place over millions and not billions of years, but with the emergence of language there was a further acceleration of time and the rate of change.","If you do not create your destiny, you will have your fate inflicted upon you.","In the domain of cops and robbers, an interdiction serves to structure a black market and a shadow economy.","One way to find food for thought is to use the fork in the road, the bifurcation that marks the place of emergence in which a new line of development begins to branch off.","The conscious purpose of science is control of Nature; its unconscious effect is disruption and chaos.","Idealistic reformers are dangerous because their idealism has no roots in love, but is simply a hysterical and unbalanced rage for order amidst their own chaos.","Ideologies do not map the complete living processes of a World.","A World is not an ideology nor a scientific institution, nor is it even a system of ideologies; rather, it is a structure of unconscious relations and symbiotic processes.","Catastrophes are often stimulated by the failure to feel the emergence of a domain, and so what cannot be felt in the imagination is experienced as embodied sensation in the catastrophe.","For the first time in human evolution, the individual life is long enough, and the cultural transformation swift enough, that the individual mind is now a constituent player in the global transformation of human culture.","Not all intelligence can be artificial now, so if we make a mistake, the consequences are no longer simply located within an institution or a national culture.","The conscious process is reflected in the imagination; the unconscious process is expressed as karma, the generation of actions divorced from thinking and alienated from feeling.","The more chaos there is, the more science holds on to abstract systems of control, and the more chaos is engendered.","The teacher of history's work should be, ideally, not simply a description of past cultures, but a performance of the culture in which we live and are increasingly taking our being.","Unconscious Polities emerge independent of conscious purpose.","With the emergence of civilization, the rate of change shifted from hundreds of thousands of years to millennia. With the emergence of science as a way of knowing the universe, the rate of change shifted to centuries."],"William Ivey Long":["At the level at which I work with people, their great talent is paired with great insecurity. Self-doubt is literally the twin of self-confidence. And I have to be there for both.","The trick about the theater is at the end of the day you cannot take any of it personally.","I'm a bachelor in the old sense of the word, meaning I flirt, I have very many close relationships, but then I come home and like to read my book.","My mind still runs too fast. If we get the wrong fabric or something is stitched the wrong way, I get so angry and so flummoxed that I start spelling my words, just to slow myself down."],"William J. Brennan, Jr.":["We do not consecrate the flag by punishing its desecration, for in doing so, we dilute the freedom this cherished emblem represents.","The Framers of the Bill of Rights did not purport to 'create' rights. Rather, they designed the Bill of Rights to prohibit our Government from infringing rights and liberties presumed to be preexisting.","There are no menial jobs, only menial attitudes.","The quest for freedom, dignity, and the rights of man will never end.","No longer is the female destined solely for the home and the rearing of the family and only the male for the marketplace and the world of ideas.","Sex, a great and mysterious motive force in human life, has indisputably been a subject of absorbing interest to mankind through the ages.","We current justices read the Constitution in the only way that we can: as 20th-century Americans.","We look to the history of the time of framing and to the intervening history of interpretation. But the ultimate question must be, what do the words of the text mean in our time.","Congress acknowledged that society's accumulated myths and fears about disability and disease are as handicapping as are the physical limitations that flow from actual impairment.","Law cannot stand aside from the social changes around it.","Religious conflict can be the bloodiest and cruelest conflicts that turn people into fanatics.","If the right to privacy means anything, it is the right of the individual, married or single, to be free from unwarranted governmental intrusion.","Sex and obscenity are not synonymous. Obscene material is material which deals with sex in a manner appealing to prurient interest.","Appellant constituted a legitimate class of one, and this provides a basis for Congress's decision to proceed with dispatch with respect to his materials.","Use of a mentally ill person's involuntary confession is antithetical to the notion of fundamental fairness embodied in the due process clause.","Death is not only an unusually severe punishment, unusual in its pain, in its finality and in its enormity, but is serves no penal purpose more effectively than a less severe punishment.","The principle inherent in the clause that prohibits pointless infliction of excessive punishment when less severe punishment can adequately achieve the same purposes invalidates the punishment."],"William J. Clinton":["There is nothing wrong with America that cannot be cured with what is right in America.","If you live long enough, you'll make mistakes. But if you learn from them, you'll be a better person. It's how you handle adversity, not how it affects you. The main thing is never quit, never quit, never quit.","It turns out that advancing equal opportunity and economic empowerment is both morally right and good economics, because discrimination, poverty and ignorance restrict growth, while investments in education, infrastructure and scientific and technological research increase it, creating more good jobs and new wealth for all of us.","When times are tough, constant conflict may be good politics but in the real world, cooperation works better. After all, nobody's right all the time, and a broken clock is right twice a day.","You can put wings on a pig, but you don't make it an eagle.","If you want a future of shared prosperity, where the middle class is growing and poverty is declining, where the American Dream is alive and well, and where the United States remains the leading force for peace and prosperity in a highly competitive world, you should vote for Barack Obama.","Promising too much can be as cruel as caring too little.","Let us all take more responsibility, not only for ourselves and our families but for our communities and our country.","Sometimes when people are under stress, they hate to think, and it's the time when they most need to think.","Character is a journey, not a destination.","In the new economy, information, education, and motivation are everything.","I am in support of the NRA position on gun control.","I want American Dream growth - lots of new businesses, well-paying jobs, and American leadership in new industries, like clean energy and biotechnology.","Being president is like running a cemetery: you've got a lot of people under you and nobody's listening.","I haven't eaten at a McDonald's since I became President.","When I think about the world I would like to leave to my daughter and the grandchildren I hope to have, it is a world that moves away from unequal, unstable, unsustainable interdependence to integrated communities - locally, nationally and globally - that share the characteristics of all successful communities.","I still believe in a place called Hope.","Hillary had never run for office before, but she decided to give it a try. She began her campaign the way she always does new things, by listening and and learning. And after a tough battle, New York elected her to the seat once held by another outsider, Robert Kennedy.","You know, everybody makes mistakes when they are president.","Saddam Hussein didn't kill 3,100 people on Sept. 11. Osama bin Laden did, and as far as we know he's still alive.","Work is about more than making a living, as vital as that is. It's fundamental to human dignity, to our sense of self-worth as useful, independent, free people.","I married my best friend. I was still in awe after more than four years of being around her at how smart and strong and loving and caring she was. And I really hoped that her choosing me and rejecting my advice to pursue her own career was a decision she would never regret.","When times are tough and people are frustrated and angry and hurting and uncertain, the politics of constant conflict may be good, but what is good politics does not necessarily work in the real world. What works in the real world is cooperation.","We must teach our children to resolve their conflicts with words, not weapons.","Let me say this as clearly as I can: No matter how sharp a grievance or how deep a hurt, there is no justification for killing innocents.","In today's knowledge-based economy, what you earn depends on what you learn. Jobs in the information technology sector, for example, pay 85 percent more than the private sector average.","Where are the jobs going to come from? Small business, manufacturing and clean energy. Where's the money to finance them? The banks and the corporations in America today have lots of money that they can invest right now.","I am grateful to President George W. Bush for PEPFAR, which is saving the lives of millions of people in poor countries and to both Presidents Bush for the work we've done together after the South Asia tsunami, Hurricane Katrina and the Haitian earthquake.","When I took office, only high energy physicists had ever heard of what is called the Worldwide Web... Now even my cat has its own page.","One way or the other, we are determined to deny Iraq the capacity to develop weapons of mass destruction and the missiles to deliver them. That is our bottom line.","If you believe in making change from the bottom up, if you believe the measure of change is how many people's lives are better, you know it's hard, and some people think it's boring.","When Chelsea was 9 months old, I was defeated for reelection in the Reagan landslide. And I became overnight, I think, the youngest former governor in the history of the country. We only had two-year terms back then.","I came of age believing that, no matter what happened, I would always be able to support myself.","When we make college more affordable, we make the American dream more achievable.","Our democracy must be not only the envy of the world but the engine of our own renewal. There is nothing wrong with America that cannot be cured by what is right with America.","A lot of presidential memoirs, they say, are dull and self-serving. I hope mine is interesting and self-serving.","The new rage is to say that the government is the cause of all our problems, and if only we had no government, we'd have no problems. I can tell you, that contradicts evidence, history, and common sense.","I believe I'm a better authority than anybody else in America on my own wife. I have never known a person with a stronger sense of right and wrong in my life ever.","In a world with no systems, with chaos, everything becomes a guerilla struggle, and this predictability is not there. And it becomes almost impossible to save lives, educate kids, develop economies, whatever.","My fellow Americans, you have to decide what kind of country you want to live in. If you want a you're on your own, winner take all society you should support the Republican ticket. If you want a country of shared opportunities and shared responsibilities - a 'we're all in it together' society, you should vote for Barack Obama and Joe Biden.","I like the job. That's what I'll miss the most... I'm not sure anybody ever liked this as much as I've liked it.","American and Israel share a special bond. Our relationship is unique among all nations. Like America, Israel is a strong democracy, a symbol of freedom, and an oasis of liberty, a home to the oppressed and persecuted.","Today, many companies are reporting that their number one constraint on growth is the inability to hire workers with the necessary skills.","President Obama's record on national security is a tribute to his strength, and judgment, and to his preference for inclusion and partnership over partisanship.","If you think the President was right to open the doors of American opportunity to young immigrants brought here as children who want to go to college or serve in the military, you should vote for Barack Obama.","When I was president, I worked hard to give you more peace and shared prosperity, to give you an America where nobody is invisible or counted out. But for this time, Hillary is uniquely qualified to seize the opportunities and reduce the risks we face. And she is still the best darn change-maker I have ever known.","In 1979, just after I became governor, I asked Hillary to chair a rural health committee to help expand health care to isolated farm and mountain areas. They recommended to do that partly by deploying trained nurse practitioners in places with no doctors to provide primary care they were trained to provide.","Though I often disagree with Republicans, I never learned to hate them the way the far right that now controls their party seems to hate President Obama and the Democrats.","Posterity is the world to come; the world for whom we hold our ideals, from whom we have borrowed our planet, and to whom we bear sacred responsibility. We must do what America does best: offer more opportunity to all and demand responsibility from all.","If you win elections on the theory that government is always bad and will mess up a two-car parade... a real change-maker represents a real threat. So your only option is to create a cartoon, a cartoon alternative, then run against the cartoon. Cartoons are two-dimensional; they're easy to absorb.","If you're a Muslim and you love America and freedom and you hate terror, stay here and help us win and make a future together. We want you.","My plan after office is to get up and spend that entire first day helping my wife move into her new senatorial office.","I don't believe you can find any evidence of the fact that I have changed government policy solely because of a contribution.","You are the most powerful cultural force in the world.","The 22nd Amendment should probably be modified to say two consecutive terms instead of two terms for a lifetime.","If Saddam rejects peace and we have to use force, our purpose is clear. We want to seriously diminish the threat posed by Iraq's weapons of mass destruction program.","Strength and wisdom are not opposing values.","Poor Darrell Hammond. What's he going to do when I leave office?","Part of our essential humanity is paying respect to what God gave us and what will be here a long time after we're gone.","Because primarily of the power of the Internet, people of modest means can band together and amass vast sums of money that can change the world for some public good if they all agree.","Well, first of all, I think that a lot of the voters who are voting for the tea party candidates have really good impulses. That is, they believe that for years and years and years, the people with wealth and power or government power have done well and ordinary people have not. That's true.","I personally don't believe we ought to be raising taxes or cutting spending, either one, until we get this economy off the ground. I'll pay more, but it won't solve the problem.","One of the main reasons America should re-elect President Obama is that he is still committed to cooperation. He appointed Republican Secretaries of Defense, the Army and Transportation. He appointed a Vice President who ran against him in 2008.","President Obama's approach embodies the values, the ideas, and the direction America must take to build a 21st century version of the American Dream in a nation of shared opportunities, shared prosperity and shared responsibilities.","When some Republican governors asked to try new ways to put people on welfare back to work, the Obama Administration said they would only do it if they had a credible plan to increase employment by 20%. You hear that? More work. So the claim that President Obama weakened welfare reform's work requirement is just not true.","President Obama has offered a plan with 4 trillion dollars in debt reduction over a decade, with two and a half dollars of spending reductions for every one dollar of revenue increases, and tight controls on future spending. It's the kind of balanced approach proposed by the bipartisan Simpson-Bowles commission.","Remember, Republican economic policies quadrupled the debt before I took office and doubled it after I left. We simply can't afford to double-down on trickle-down.","President Obama started with a much weaker economy than I did. Listen to me now. No president, not me, not any of my predecessors, no one could have fully repaired all the damage that he found in just four years.","It's heartbreaking to see so many people trapped in a web of enforced idleness, deep debt, and gnawing self-doubt.","You have to make a conscious decision to change for your own well-being and that of your family and your country.","When I became president with a commitment to reform health care, Hillary was a natural to head the health care task force. You all know we failed because we couldn't break a Senate filibuster. Hillary immediately went to work on solving the problems the bill sought to address one by one.","Hillary will make us stronger together. You know it because she's spent a lifetime doing it."],"William J. H. Boetcker":["Better to be a strong man with a weak point, than to be a weak man without a strong point. A diamond with a flaw is more valuable that a brick without a flaw.","The difficulties and struggles of today are but the price we must pay for the accomplishments and victories of tomorrow.","That you may retain your self-respect, it is better to displease the people by doing what you know is right, than to temporarily please them by doing what you know is wrong.","Your success depends mainly upon what you think of yourself and whether you believe in yourself.","Never mind what others do; do better than yourself, beat your own record from day to day, and you are a success.","You cannot build character and courage by taking away a man's initiative and independence.","The individual activity of one man with backbone will do more than a thousand men with a mere wishbone.","You cannot bring about prosperity by discouraging thrift.","True religion... is giving and finding one's happiness by bringing happiness into the lives of others.","The more you learn what to do with yourself, and the more you do for others, the more you will learn to enjoy the abundant life.","What a different world this would be if people would listen to those who know more and not merely try to get something from those who have more.","You cannot build character and courage by destroying men's initiative and independence.","We will never have real safety and security for wage earners unless we provide for safety and security for the wage payers and wage savers.","If you want to know how rich you really are, find out what would be left of you tomorrow if you should lose every dollar you own tonight.","You cannot help the poor by destroying the rich.","You cannot raise a man up by calling him down.","If your business keeps you so busy that you have no time for anything else, there must be something wrong, either with you or with your business.","You cannot strengthen the weak by weakening the strong.","You cannot help little men by tearing down big men.","You cannot lift the wage earner by pulling down the wage payer.","You cannot establish sound security on borrowed money.","You cannot further the brotherhood of man by inciting class hatred.","You cannot keep out of trouble by spending more than you earn.","And you cannot help men permanently by doing for them what they can and should do for themselves."],"William J. Mann":["Here's what's interesting about Katharine Hepburn: she was born a girl but identified as a boy, so she shaved her head and rechristened herself Jimmy.","Let's be clear about one thing: a film about Katharine Hepburn is an excellent idea. She was one of the most fascinating, complex stars ever to grace a motion picture screen, and she deserves a full-scale, big-screen biographical treatment.","No one ever cut Katharine Hepburn down to size.","The limited fictions used to sell the lives of public figures often form a cloudy chiaroscuro that covers their true humanity.","Writing about identity can be like maneuvering through a minefield, even when considering contemporary figures who have discussed the subject themselves.","Elizabeth Taylor was the first star for whom an offscreen narrative was equally as important as an onscreen one. Her private life became as much of a driving force of her fame and success as any role she played in the movies.","'Dark Shadows' was the spark that lit the fire of my childhood imagination. It wasn't polished; it wasn't perfect. But it gave us characters with real personalities and complicated motivations.","With its missed lines and falling tombstones, 'Dark Shadows' was sometimes inadvertently funny, but what made the show work was the fact that the actors and the writers took it all very seriously."],"William J. Mayo":["The aim of medicine is to prevent disease and prolong life, the ideal of medicine is to eliminate the need of a physician.","Given one well-trained physician of the highest type he will do better work for a thousand people than ten specialists.","Lord, deliver me from the man who never makes a mistake, and also from the man who makes the same mistake twice.","A specialist is a man who knows more and more about less and less."],"William J.

It could be the person you marry, or it could just be literally your bosom buddy. Whatever is the most fulfilling relationship for you. It can be whatever you want it to be.","I'm a black nerd - a blerd!","Paradise for me, at this point, would probably be tacos, video games, and my lady. Just hanging out and eating tacos and not getting big.","When I was a kid, they made us write these essays about what Heaven would be like. I went to this Christian school in Texas, and the thing that I wrote was no bees. No bees. No mud. No infirmities.","I've been doing theater for a long time, so that's something I understand. I'm such a babe in the woods when it comes to TV and film. I'm still learning. It's exciting.","There's so much control of the audience's experience when you're on stage doing a play, whereas when working on camera, there's a lot of people that have to do a lot of things exactly right for anything that I do to matter at all.","Once you learn how to free up in front of the camera, it's like nothing else.","I have a weird thing - if I can't see where all the walls in my house are, I get a little bit freaked out. I think New York has Stockholm Syndrome'd my sense of space and what a house should be.","For fun, I love to play the drums... poorly.

We call ourselves The U.S. Open."],"William Jackson":["When I was nine years old I use to copy - not trace - the covers of the Donald Duck comics. Many years later I became a close friend of Jack Hannah, the director of the Donald Duck film shorts.","The journalism school helped me develop writing skills, and I had been enjoying cartooning from a very young age. My interest in puppetry, however, came much later.","I pitched my last children's show presentation in the mid 1980's. The era of locally produced children's shows was over and the networks were not and are not interested in children's television.","I would not have done much differently, but I would have loved to have done everything better. The truth is, I think I was just getting warmed up when the era ended.","I have no idea how to become successful in children's tv programming today other than to say that whereever you find that rare animal being pursued, insert yourself into its environment; get in the door in any position and work from within.","I'm not up on today's television for children, because it's mostly cartoons that don't seem to interest me.","The puppet characters were combinations of people I had known and to some degree aspects of my own personality. Weird was based on someone I knew in Chicago. Dirty Dragon was based on a good friend I had in Indianapolis.","It is no accident that I made Cartoon Town a simple little village - in many ways it mirrored my home town. And, yes, many of my puppet characters took on some of the more eccentric characteristics of people I knew there.","A lot of industry groups have said they support a federal law. They don't want to have to deal with 50 different state laws."],"William James":["The greatest weapon against stress is our ability to choose one thought over another.","Believe that life is worth living and your belief will help create the fact.","Pessimism leads to weakness, optimism to power.","Act as if what you do makes a difference. It does.","Acceptance of what has happened is the first step to overcoming the consequences of any misfortune.","Time itself comes in drops.","The deepest principle in human nature is the craving to be appreciated.","The greatest discovery of my generation is that a human being can alter his life by altering his attitudes.","The art of being wise is the art of knowing what to overlook.","Whenever you're in conflict with someone, there is one factor that can make the difference between damaging your relationship and deepening it. That factor is attitude.","If you care enough for a result, you will most certainly attain it.","We are all ready to be savage in some cause. The difference between a good man and a bad one is the choice of the cause.","The greatest use of a life is to spend it on something that will outlast it.","The aim of a college education is to teach you to know a good man when you see one.","There is no more miserable human being than one in whom nothing is habitual but indecision.","Begin to be now what you will be hereafter.","The sovereign cure for worry is prayer.","Success or failure depends more upon attitude than upon capacity successful men act as though they have accomplished or are enjoying something. Soon it becomes a reality. Act, look, feel successful, conduct yourself accordingly, and you will be amazed at the positive results.","Belief creates the actual fact.","The world we see that seems so insane is the result of a belief system that is not working. To perceive the world differently, we must be willing to change our belief system, let the past slip away, expand our sense of now, and dissolve the fear in our minds.","A chain is no stronger than its weakest link, and life is after all a chain.","I don't sing because I'm happy; I'm happy because I sing.","To change ones life: Start immediately. Do it flamboyantly.","Is life worth living? It all depends on the liver.","Our normal waking consciousness, rational consciousness as we call it, is but one special type of consciousness, whilst all about it, parted from it by the filmiest of screens, there lie potential forms of consciousness entirely different.","Human beings can alter their lives by altering their attitudes of mind.","Action seems to follow feeling, but really action and feeling go together; and by regulating the action, which is under the more direct control of the will, we can indirectly regulate the feeling, which is not.","Do something everyday for no other reason than you would rather not do it, so that when the hour of dire need draws nigh, it may find you not unnerved and untrained to stand the test.","If the grace of God miraculously operates, it probably operates through the subliminal door.","Every man who possibly can should force himself to a holiday of a full month in a year, whether he feels like taking it or not.","There is only one thing a philosopher can be relied upon to do, and that is to contradict other philosophers.","What every genuine philosopher (every genuine man, in fact) craves most is praise although the philosophers generally call it recognition!","A great many people think they are thinking when they are merely rearranging their prejudices.","It is our attitude at the beginning of a difficult task which, more than anything else, will affect its successful outcome.","If you want a quality, act as if you already had it.","Action may not bring happiness but there is no happiness without action.","To study the abnormal is the best way of understanding the normal.","Be willing to have it so. Acceptance of what has happened is the first step to overcoming the consequences of any misfortune.","Nothing is so fatiguing as the eternal hanging on of an uncompleted task.","The sway of alcohol over mankind is unquestionably due to its power to stimulate the mystical faculties of human nature, usually crushed to earth by the cold facts and dry criticisms of the sober hour.","There is but one cause of human failure. And that is man's lack of faith in his true Self.","If you believe that feeling bad or worrying long enough will change a past or future event, then you are residing on another planet with a different reality system.","Those thoughts are truth which guide us to beneficial interaction with sensible particulars as they occur, whether they copy these in advance or not.","Let everything you do be done as if it makes a difference.","The community stagnates without the impulse of the individual. The impulse dies away without the sympathy of the community.","Why should we think upon things that are lovely? Because thinking determines life. It is a common habit to blame life upon the environment. Environment modifies life but does not govern life. The soul is stronger than its surroundings.","Compared to what we ought to be, we are half awake.","Truth is what works.","We have to live today by what truth we can get today and be ready tomorrow to call it falsehood.","Our errors are surely not such awfully solemn things. In a world where we are so certain to incur them in spite of all our caution, a certain lightness of heart seems healthier than this excessive nervousness on their behalf.","Truth lives, in fact, for the most part on a credit system. Our thoughts and beliefs pass, so long as nothing challenges them, just as bank-notes pass so long as nobody refuses them.","To spend life for something which outlasts it.","Most people never run far enough on their first wind to find out they've got a second.","Man can alter his life by altering his thinking.","It is only by risking our persons from one hour to another that we live at all. And often enough our faith beforehand in an uncertified result is the only thing that makes the result come true.","No matter how full a reservoir of maxims one may possess, and no matter how good one's sentiments may be, if one has not taken advantage of every concrete opportunity to act, one's character may remain entirely unaffected for the better.","An idea, to be suggestive, must come to the individual with the force of revelation.","The greatest enemy of any one of our truths may be the rest of our truths.","It is well for the world that in most of us, by the age of thirty, the character has set like plaster, and will never soften again.","When you have to make a choice and don't make it, that is in itself a choice.","In the dim background of mind we know what we ought to be doing but somehow we cannot start.","Everybody should do at least two things each day that he hates to do, just for practice.","This life is worth living, we can say, since it is what we make it.","We don't laugh because we're happy - we're happy because we laugh.","If any organism fails to fulfill its potentialities, it becomes sick.","How to gain, how to keep, how to recover happiness is in fact for most men at all times the secret motive of all they do, and of all they are willing to endure.","Many people think they are thinking when they are merely rearranging their prejudices.","To be conscious means not simply to be, but to be reported, known, to have awareness of one's being added to that being.","There must be something solemn, serious, and tender about any attitude which we denominate religious. If glad, it must not grin or snicker; if sad, it must not scream or curse.","The world is all the richer for having a devil in it, so long as we keep our foot upon his neck.","Metaphysics means nothing but an unusually obstinate effort to think clearly.","The 'I think' which Kant said must be able to accompany all my objects, is the 'I breathe' which actually does accompany them.","To be radical, an empiricism must neither admit into its constructions any element that is not directly experienced, nor exclude from them any element that is directly experienced.","Our esteem for facts has not neutralized in us all religiousness. It is itself almost religious. Our scientific temper is devout.","It is wrong always, everywhere, and for everyone, to believe anything upon insufficient evidence.","Individuality is founded in feeling; and the recesses of feeling, the darker, blinder strata of character, are the only places in the world in which we catch real fact in the making, and directly perceive how events happen, and how work is actually done.","The ideas gained by men before they are twenty-five are practically the only ideas they shall have in their lives.","In business for yourself, not by yourself.","Genius... means little more than the faculty of perceiving in an unhabitual way.","Great emergencies and crises show us how much greater our vital resources are than we had supposed.","An act has no ethical quality whatever unless it be chosen out of several all equally possible.","One hearty laugh together will bring enemies into a closer communion of heart than hours spent on both sides in inward wrestling with the mental demon of uncharitable feeling.","The god whom science recognizes must be a God of universal laws exclusively, a God who does a wholesale, not a retail business. He cannot accommodate his processes to the convenience of individuals.","Faith means belief in something concerning which doubt is theoretically possible.","Our faith is faith in someone else's faith, and in the greatest matters this is most the case.","Knowledge about life is one thing; effective occupation of a place in life, with its dynamic currents passing through your being, is another.","We are doomed to cling to a life even while we find it unendurable.","A man has as many social selves as there are individuals who recognize him.","We never fully grasp the import of any true statement until we have a clear notion of what the opposite untrue statement would be.","Whatever universe a professor believes in must at any rate be a universe that lends itself to lengthy discourse. A universe definable in two sentences is something for which the professorial intellect has no use. No faith in anything of that cheap kind!","Where quality is the thing sought after, the thing of supreme quality is cheap, whatever the price one has to pay for it.","If merely 'feeling good' could decide, drunkenness would be the supremely valid human experience.","The hell to be endured hereafter, of which theology tells, is no worse than the hell we make for ourselves in this world by habitually fashioned our characters in the wrong way.","The best argument I know for an immortal life is the existence of a man who deserves one.","To be a real philosopher all that is necessary is to hate some one else's type of thinking.","Man lives for science as well as bread.","The history of philosophy is to a great extent that of a certain clash of human temperaments.","Could the young but realize how soon they will become mere walking bundles of habits, they would give more heed to their conduct while in the plastic state.","There is an organic affinity between joyousness and tenderness, and their companionship in the saintly life need in no way occasion surprise.","'Pure experience' is the name I gave to the immediate flux of life which furnishes the material to our later reflection with its conceptual categories."],"William Jay Smith":["As any parent, teacher, or librarian knows, there is no richer experience than to see children's faces light up at the suspense of a new tale or the surprise of a new poem. The uninhibited joy with which they listen is surely akin to that of adult audiences of old around campfire and hearth.","For every artist, experience is never complete until it has been reproduced in creative work.","A fresh and vigorous weed, always renewed and renewing, it will cut its wondrous way through rubbish and rubble.","I have always used a great variety of verse forms, especially in my poetry for children. I believe that poetry begins in childhood and that a poet who can remember his own childhood exactly can, and should, communicate to children.","I have felt at times with groups of children that I was really being what every poet would like to be - a bard in the old sense.","To the poet, his travels, his adventures, his loves, his indignations are finally resolved in verse, and this, in the end becomes his permanent, indestructible life.","To Tennessee Williams we owe a special debt. In a tragic age, he has transformed loneliness by naming it for us, suffered sordidness with beauty, graced poor hurt lives with love and pity.","I have published so many books in so many years. I can't complain about any lack of attention. But I've never been placed as a Southern writer, which I really am. So I was happy finally to be published by someone in the South.","I always had good recognition from the Southern writers, but the publishers never took any notice of that.","I still use a typewriter from time to time, but because I can't type as well as I used to, I really don't use one very much.","I believe that poetry should communicate.","It was the enchantment of spoken verse that led me to write for children."],"William Jay":["Half the pleasure of solitude comes from having with us some friend to whom we can say how sweet solitude is.","A dislike of death is no proof of the want of religion. The instincts of nature shrink from it, for no creature can like its own dissolution. But though death is not desired, the result of it may be, for dying to the Christian is the way to life eternal."],"William Jennings Bryan":["Destiny is no matter of chance. It is a matter of choice. It is not a thing to be waited for, it is a thing to be achieved.","The way to develop self-confidence is to do the thing you fear and get a record of successful experiences behind you.","Burn down your cities and leave our farms, and your cities will spring up again as if by magic; but destroy our farms and the grass will grow in the streets of every city in the country.","This is not a contest between persons. The humblest citizen in all the land, when clad in the armor of a righteous cause, is stronger than all the hosts of error. I come to you in defense of a cause as holy as the cause of liberty - the cause of humanity.","No one can earn a million dollars honestly.","Anglo-Saxon civilization has taught the individual to protect his own rights; American civilization will teach him to respect the rights of others.","If we have to give up either religion or education, we should give up education.","There is no more reason to believe that man descended from some inferior animal than there is to believe that a stately mansion has descended from a small cottage.","Never be afraid to stand with the minority when the minority is right, for the minority which is right will one day be the majority.","Two people in a conversation amount to four people talking. The four are what one person says, what he really wanted to say, what his listener heard, and what he thought he heard.","Eloquent speech is not from lip to ear, but rather from heart to heart.","My place in history will depend on what I can do for the people and not on what the people can do for me.","Do not compute the totality of your poultry population until all the manifestations of incubation have been entirely completed.","If the Bible had said that Jonah swallowed the whale, I would believe it.","There can be no settlement of a great cause without discussion, and people will not discuss a cause until their attention is drawn to it.","Evolution seems to close the heart to some of the plainest spiritual truths while it opens the mind to the wildest guesses advanced in the name of science.","The humblest citizen of all the land, when clad in the armor of a righteous cause, is stronger than all the hosts of error.","The Imperial German Government will not expect the Government of the United States to omit any word or any act necessary to the performance of its sacred duty of maintaining the rights of the United States and its citizens and of safeguarding their free exercise and enjoyment.","One miracle is just as easy to believe as another.","Behold a republic standing erect while empires all around are bowed beneath the weight of their own armaments - a republic whose flag is loved while other flags are only feared.","I hope the two wings of the Democratic Party may flap together.","If that vital spark that we find in a grain of wheat can pass unchanged through countless deaths and resurrections, will the spirit of man be unable to pass from this body to another?","All the ills from which America suffers can be traced to the teaching of evolution.","The parents have a right to say that no teacher paid by their money shall rob their children of faith in God and send them back to their homes skeptical, or infidels, or agnostics, or atheists.","None so little enjoy themselves, and are such burdens to themselves, as those who have nothing to do. Only the active have the true relish of life."],"William Jerome":["Any old place I can hang my hat is home sweet home to me."],"William John Wills":["The pigeon here is a beautiful bird, of a delicate bronze colour, tinged with pink about the neck, and the wings marked with green and purple.","You should carefully study the Art of Reasoning, as it is what most people are very deficient in, and I know few things more disagreeable than to argue, or even converse with a man who has no idea of inductive and deductive philosophy.","The country up here is beautiful; everything green and pleasant; and if you saw it now, you would not believe that in two months' time it could have such a parched and barren appearance as it will then assume.","Both camels are dead and our provisions are done.","Our clothes are going to pieces fast. Send provisions as soon as possible.","I have deposited some of my journals here for fear of accidents.","We have this morning dropped anchor, just off Williamstown.","I do not like Melbourne in its present state.","Everyone who comes out does a very foolish thing in bringing such a quantity of clothes that he never wants.","I consider nothing low but ignorance, vice, and meanness, characteristics generally found where the animal propensities predominate over the higher sentiments.","This country is undergoing great changes for the better.","What you say about this world I do not quite agree with; I think it a very good world, and only requires a person to be reasonable in his expectations, and not to trust too much to others.","Melbourne is wonderfully altered since I last saw it. There are some very fair buildings in it now, and things are a little cheaper than they used to be.","It is of great importance to note these meteors, even the small ones, as very little is yet known of them; and every observation, if carefully made, will some day help to show what they are.","I see by your letter to my father that you are rather afraid the French may invade England.","They have just succeeded in raising the two thousand pounds here, by subscription, that was wanted towards an exploration fund, for fitting out an expedition, that will probably start for the interior of our continent next March.","The actual danger is nothing, and the positive advantages very great.","I am often disgusted at hearing young people I know, declare that they are afraid of doing this or that, because they MIGHT be killed.","At any rate, girls are differently situated. Having no need of deep scientific knowledge, their education is confined more to the ordinary things of the world, the study of the fine arts, and of the manners and dispositions of people.","We all think we are right, or we should not believe as we do.","These rare senses and powers of reasoning were given to be used freely, but not audaciously, to discover, not to pervert the truth.","I have been agreeably disappointed in my idea of the camels. They are far from unpleasant to ride; in fact, it is much less fatiguing than riding on horseback, and even with the little practice I have yet had, I find it shakes me less.","Our journey so far has been very satisfactory: we are most fortunate as regards the season, for there has been more rain this winter than has been known for the last four or five years."],"William Joyce":["I like stirring things up. I'm on the side of the kids more than I am on the adults. And occasionally I find some adults that have that same mischievous streak, so I don't get in too much trouble.","The only road to the highest stations in this country is that of the law.","Almost everything in 'A Day With Wilbur Robinson' has some basis in truth. And yes, my sister did pay me to feed her grapes while she talked to her boyfriend on the phone.","And I was lucky enough to have teachers that really, really looked out for me and really encouraged all that. And in rural Louisiana, that was a rare thing back then.","And they're also very good at math, these super boogers, and so they teach Billy the ways of mathematics.","But if you really love to write and you really love to tell stories and you really love to draw, you just have to keep doing it no matter what anybody says.","I did not win and in fact I was called into the principal's office for a consultation with my parents. But that was the beginning of my literary career.","I have known lots of adults who enjoyed similar enthusiasms as a kid and weren't encouraged and then didn't go anywhere with it and so they're unhappy in their jobs as adults.","I just took the idea that King Kong was too big for everything and reversed it and put George in a land of giants, which is basically what every kid goes through anyway - that, you know, the world is made for grownups, for tall people, for the giants.","I raised frogs every spring in our house from tadpoles and by end of summer our house was overrun with frogs.","I've always liked getting away with just a little bit of what you're not supposed to. Like my first book, Billy's Booger, got me in trouble with the principal's office.","If you really want to tell stories, do it and don't be dissuaded.","So if you're a robot and you're living on this planet, you can do things that you can't do in real life - things that you wished you could do: like fly; like have a car that flies; like have furniture that is alive.","The first book I ever wrote was in fourth grade and it was called 'Billy's Booger.' It was an autobiographical piece about a kid who was really bad at math.","Their toys are alive and can sometimes come to their aid, or get lost and Olie has to find them. They go to other planets. They go to the ice cream planet.","You know, I hate to give advice because my life has been so odd that almost nothing that's happened to me can apply."],"William Julius Wilson":["But the person who scored well on an SAT will not necessarily be the best doctor or the best lawyer or the best businessman. These tests do not measure character, leadership, creativity, perseverance.","During the Great Depression, African Americans were faced with problems that were not unlike those experienced by the most disadvantaged groups in society. The Great Depression had a leveling effect, and all groups really experienced hard times: poor whites, poor blacks.","I don't think we should stop emphasizing race because I think, you know, race is still very, very important, and we have to recognize that and continue to introduce programs to address racial inequities. But we have to widen our vision and also address the growing problems of economic class.","Black professors make more than white professors. That's because we are in demand. I'll tell you, give me two blacks in institutions of higher learning, one has a Ph.D. from an elite institution and has a certain publication record. You give me a white scholar with the same credentials, and I will take that black scholar.","The middle class has just fallen further and further behind the rich.","Liberals were intimidated by the Reagan administration and did not want to appear naive by talking about programs that called for government support. I just said, 'The hell with that. I'm out there.'","Crime, family dissolution, welfare, and low levels of social organization are fundamentally a consequence of the disappearance of work.","My research clearly reveals that if we want to put inner-city workers to work immediately, we just can't rely on the private sector. They don't want to touch them; they don't want to hire them.","There is a tendency to want to treat blacks as a monolithic socioeconomic group.","I maintain that the period during the first half of the 1990s, the period in which rising inequality reached its peak, was a period in which we came very, very close to a demagogic immobilization of racism in this society.","If you're not working, over time you're much more likely to develop attitudes and orientations and behavior patterns that are associated with casual or infrequent work. And then when you open up opportunities for people, you notice that these attitudes, orientations, habits and styles also change.","Prior to 1940, the affluent and the middle class began to converge, but after 1979, the economic gap between the middle class and affluent widened significantly.","A lot of joblessness in the black community doesn't seem to be reachable through fiscal and monetary policies. People have not been drawn into the labor market even during periods of economic recovery.","The worst thing we could do is impose time limits and then expect people to sink or swim once they move off welfare.","There are many positive things to say about the black community. No question about it.","Certain people are just saying, 'Look, I'm a businessperson and I have to run a business effectively and I want people who are going to do the job, who have the training and the education and the personality traits - the soft skills.'","Black employers are just as negative as the white employers concerning inner-city workers."],"William K. Sessions":["The goal is justice, not executions. We all want to make sure the process is fair and that the right person is punished. These recommendations are essential to that goal.","Looking back on my life, I wish I'd stepped forward and made a fool of myself more often when I was younger - because when you do, you find out you can do it."],"William Kamkwamba":["Sometimes you can fail in an experiment. But if you fail, you still don't stop observing that thing, looking for a better way.","I would tell most young people that in life you can go through many difficulties, but if you know what you want to do, if you can focus, and work, then in the end, you will end up doing it. No matter what happens, if you don't give up, you will still succeed.","One thing that has helped me to become patient and cool is that I grew up with sisters.","I want to bring clean water to people who do not have it. What I'm trying to do now is think of ways to build a well-drilling machine that is low-cost so people in rural areas can afford it.","I will always be looking back at the things I've gone through, thinking of the struggling people I've seen.","People in my village had this mindset that in big cities like New York, if you are lost or without directions, no one will help you. The first time I came here, I tried to make sure not to walk by myself, because it would be difficult for me if I got lost. But people will help you.","Me and my cousin, most of the time we worked on radios and fixed them. I guess we started because I was curious to understand how radios work. When I was little, I used to think there were small people inside. Most of the time, I was just trying to see the people who are speaking in the radio.","I want to bring clean water to people who do not have it. What I'm trying to do now is think of ways to build a well-drilling machine that is low-cost so people in rural areas can afford it. People in rural places could use the water for irrigation or for drinking.","Clean water and power is our right as humans on this earth, and for too long, our governments in Africa have failed to provide these things.","I want to build a machine that can drill wells for water. With this problem of water in many places in Africa, we need to find a solution for how you can dig wells so you can be pumping water from deeper places.","Climate change is important to Malawi, but many people see alternative energy more as a means to skip the government and get electricity and power. Deforestation is a huge problem in Malawi, which only adds to the problem. People cut down trees because they have no power to run electric stoves, etc. So they use firewood."],"William Katt":["When I play a good guy, I try to explore them and figure out what shapes them and makes them interesting. When I'm playing a bad guy, I try to explore everything that makes them good. No one ever really thinks that they're a bad guy.","I like to spend as much time on the stage as possible. I don't do a regular TV series because I don't want to be overexposed.","I try to cover myself, to have another movie under way before the last one comes out. I've been able to just scrape by, holding out for good parts instead of taking anything.","Audiences can be leery of sequels; the studios make a hit, they see dollar signs, and they make a cheap rip-off."],"William Kempe":["I have had so many great moments, but I would have to say that dancing the Swan in 'Swan Lake' was such a unique and passionate experience for me. It was such bloody hard work, even at that very early age, that I would not want to try to replicate it again now.","My background is somewhat unusual, as I trained to be a ballet dancer. I worked in the theatre for eight or nine years as a contemporary dancer. But as an actor one does read Shakespeare and does try to learn the classics.","I think we all have to fight the werewolf within us somehow.","I believe that if creative people are open and generous enough when working with each other, a lot more can be learned and achieved by both parties. That's what it's all about, trying to produce the best work possible on any given project.","I enjoy being given a certain amount of freedom in order to interpret or to come up with stuff, but I do enjoy collaboration. I seek and thrive on projects where I am going to learn from the people I'm working with.","I feel that the year ahead for me will be full of two of my favorite things: dance and acting.","I used to do this as a kid. And now they're paying me for it, which is cool.","I've learned the hard lesson that you can't pin your heart on anything until it's a completely done deal."],"William Kennedy":["There's only a short walk from the hallelujah to the hoot.","Without a sense of place the work is often reduced to a cry of voices in empty rooms, a literature of the self, at its best poetic music; at its worst a thin gruel of the ego."],"William Kent Krueger":["When you're a writer, you're always looking for conflict. It's conflict that drives great stories.","'Ordinary Grace' freed me. I don't have to write only Cork O'Connor novels now. I'm liberated. I can write whatever I want to write.","Readers anticipate that a significant element of every story will be additional exposure to the ways of the Ojibwe. The truth is that I enjoy this aspect of the work. Although I have no Indian blood running through my veins, in college I prepared to be a cultural anthropologist, so exploring other cultures is exciting to me.","I think that whether we acknowledge it or not, our opinions as authors always influence our work. How can they not?","I don't know any real billionaires.","Write because you love the work, not because of what might come from it. The journey is the purpose. Very Zen-like, I know, but honest to God it's the truth. And I have never had to deal with writer's block. Knock on wood."],"William Kent":["All gardening is landscape painting.","Garden as though you will live forever.","A garden is to be a world unto itself, it had better make room for the darker shades of feeling as well as the sunny ones."],"William Kidd":["I would rather my soul broil in hell than I do you any harm.","I had no money nor friends to prepare for the trial till last night.","This ship was a league from us, and some of the men would have taken her, and I would not consent to it, and this Moore said I always hindered them making their fortunes. Was that not the reason I struck him? Was there a mutiny on board?","I have been sworn against by perjured and wicked people.","My lord, I have some matter of law relating to the indictment, and I desire counsel to speak to it.","If you will take her, you may take her, but if you go from aboard, you shall never come aboard again.","I desire to put off my trial as long as I can till I can get my evidence ready.","I do not care so much for the death of my gunner, as for other passages of my voyage, for I have good friends in England that will bring me off for that.","My lord, I will tell you what the case was. I was coming up within a league of the Dutchman, and some of my men were making a mutiny about taking her, and my gunner told the people he could put the captain in a way to take the ship, and be safe."],"William Kingdon Clifford":["The danger to society is not merely that it should believe wrong things, though that is great enough; but that it should become credulous, and lose the habit of testing things and inquiring into them; for then it must sink back into savagery.","To sum up: it is wrong always, everywhere, and for anyone, to believe anything upon insufficient evidence.","An atmosphere of beliefs and conceptions has been formed by the labours and struggles of our forefathers, which enables us to breathe amid the various and complex circumstances of our life.","If a belief is not realized immediately in open deeds, it is stored up for the guidance of the future.","When an action is once done, it is right or wrong for ever; no accidental failure of its good or evil fruits can possibly alter that.","No simplicity of mind, no obscurity of station, can escape the universal duty of questioning all that we believe.","We feel much happier and more secure when we think we know precisely what to do, no matter what happens, then when we have lost our way and do not know where to turn.","To know all about anything is to know how to deal with it under all circumstances.","In like manner, if I let myself believe anything on insufficient evidence, there may be no great harm done by the mere belief; it may be true after all, or I may never have occasion to exhibit it in outward acts.","Nor is it that truly a belief at all which has not some influence upon the actions of him who holds it.","He who truly believes that which prompts him to an action has looked upon the action to lust after it, he has committed it already in his heart.","Our lives our guided by that general conception of the course of things which has been created by society for social purposes.","Into this, for good or ill, is woven every belief of every man who has speech of his fellows. A awful privilege, and an awful responsibility, that we should help to create the world in which posterity will live.","Every rustic who delivers in the village alehouse his slow, infrequent sentences, may help to kill or keep alive the fatal superstitions which clog his race.","This sense of power is the highest and best of pleasures when the belief on which it is founded is a true belief, and has been fairly earned by investigation.","If I steal money from any person, there may be no harm done from the mere transfer of possession; he may not feel the loss, or it may prevent him from using the money badly. But I cannot help doing this great wrong towards Man, that I make myself dishonest.","The harm which is done by credulity in a man is not confined to the fostering of a credulous character in others, and consequent support of false beliefs.","To consider only one other such witness: the followers of the Buddha have at least as much right to appeal to individual and social experience in support of the authority of the Eastern saviour.","The rule which should guide us in such cases is simple and obvious enough: that the aggregate testimony of our neighbours is subject to the same conditions as the testimony of any one of them.","Namely, we have no right to believe a thing true because everybody says so unless there are good grounds for believing that some one person at least has the means of knowing what is true, and is speaking the truth so far as he knows it.","A little reflection will show us that every belief, even the simplest and most fundamental, goes beyond experience when regarded as a guide to our actions.","We may always depend on it that algebra, which cannot be translated into good English and sound common sense, is bad algebra.","There is no scientific discoverer, no poet, no painter, no musician, who will not tell you that he found ready made his discovery or poem or picture - that it came to him from outside, and that he did not consciously create it from within.","It is wrong always, everywhere, and for anyone, to believe anything upon insufficient evidence."],"William Kirby":["East Asia has prospered since the end of the Vietnam War, and Northeast Asia has prospered since the end of the Korean War in a way that seems unimaginable when you think of the history of the first half of the century.","You could argue that war is always an irrational act, and yet many states enter into military conflict out of rational calculation or national interest or the stability or longevity of their regime.","The greater concerns in China and Taiwan are on the political side, not on the economic side.","A war in the Taiwan Strait would destroy China's international relations overnight. It would destroy Chinese - Japanese relations, not to mention Chinese - American relations.","Now, I believe that war is never inevitable until it starts, but there has been a great proclivity in human history, and including in recent history, for war.","I don't believe that economic and cultural interaction automatically brings greater peace and understanding, although it may help in that regard.","There is no question that Taiwan is a state in any political science definition of a state.","The most important thing that certainly the United States and other Asian and Pacific actors have done is to urge that whatever happens, however the dispute is resolved, that it be resolved peacefully.","So, anything that avoids a conflict that could draw in, unhappily again, outside powers such as the United States or revisit, for example, Japan's interests in the Taiwan area would be the last thing that anyone would want.","The PRC is the big brother in this relationship, and it has the capacity to be generous to Taiwan on this issue in a manner that might do much to defuse that issue internally in Taiwan.","Taiwan is a major economy.","The Chinese government since 1979 has been very successful in economic development, and successful enough, simply by surviving, in the realm of political development.","The reform of state industry, and most directly related to that, the banking sector, is enormously daunting.","So, I think China desperately needs to legitimize some form of opposition.","Harvard is first and foremost a university and not a consulting operation, and our job here is to teach and to research and to create knowledge on Asia in conjunction and in cooperation with scholars as well as with political, intellectual, and cultural leaders in Asia.","I would hope we would begin a series of projects that would do more to bring the different parts of the university together in the study of Asia, for example, in the study of the professions in Asia.","Another goal is to look to the resources we have and to see how we could do better to plan, in a sense, for the faculty and infrastructure that we will need to study Asia well into the 21st century.","And look at the mess that Russia is; most Chinese don't want to follow that."],"William Kircher":["For some time, I thought being a producer would be a more fulfilling career than being an actor. But then I went to a conference in Cannes with 300 other producers, all desperately chasing finance for their projects... and realized being an actor wasn't so bad after all!","The thing about working with Peter Jackson is that, at the end of the day, he is a passionate artist.","Everyone in the '80s was reading Tolkien; he invented this whole medieval fantasy genre.","Films are always different from books.","Tolkien fans reacted so strongly to 'Lord Of The Rings' as a franchise because it stayed true; the heart of it was true to the book.","Adolescence is a difficult time at the best of times, and especially in a smaller town - there's all these different energies going on.","It's great to work with people who are jobbing actors at different stages of their career, and learning from them, and getting over being star-struck by somebody like Ian McKellen because he has such a long prestigious history in the business, but then seeing how he works on the camera; you never stop learning.","If you want to act, do school plays. If they're not there, create them, and the same with local repertory. They are the grounding for a lot of people. Make it happen."],"William Klein":["My way of living and working is that I'll do my thing. I went from one thing to another. That annoyed people. They didn't know how to categorize me.","Memories. That's the thing about photography. I look at the contact sheet, and it brings back everything: whether I was tired, whether I was full of beans.","I think it's obscene. I don't know how you support the monarchy. How can you do that?","I saw New York differently after being in Paris for a few years.","I always dreamt of becoming an artist in Paris. Thanks to the Army, it happened.","I was a very clumsy Jewish kid.","My sister was brilliant: she was in the 25 top math students in the country. When she finished college, I said, 'Spend a couple of months here in Europe. You'll get another take on life.' She never came - married some schmuck who made clothes for fat women on Seventh Avenue.","I'm an outsider, I guess.","When you use film, you use accidents, but there aren't any accidents with digital photography. I don't mind that it's easy. But I do mind that there is a sort of consensus with the camera and the subject and the light, and you look at something, and you photograph it, and you get what you see.","My father was like Willy Loman, you know: he never really made it - and he was from a family where there were people who had made it.","Why did I take fashion photographs? I thought it was fun. And there was a lot of money.","Fashion had no interest for me. I would take photographs in the studio. I would go back home, and my wife would say, 'What is the fashion like for this season?' And I would say, 'I have no idea.'","If I look back, I think most of the things I did - the films, the books, the collaborations with these magazines - were mostly by accident.","French photography was basically poetic, and mine was vulgar and brash and violent, except that there's never any violence in the photographs: it's only in the photographic style.","I like the streets. I grew up in the streets.","Being an expatriate doesn't go down well in America.","I was 24 years old at the time. I had no real notion of what photography was about. I had no training. By accident, I put a negative in an enlarger, and you can do many things with that negative.","I grew up in New York, in a rough neighborhood where our biggest concern was not getting beat up. I was always far from the center of the Big Apple.","I like film. I'm old fashioned.","In fashion, you have assistants, flashes; you can make sets. There are people running around doing things for you. But I can take it or leave it.","For my first book, 'New York,' I had one camera and two lenses. It was fotografia povera.","Fashion was more of a sideline for me. I did it for the money.","I like dark humor. I think the world is very funny and tragic, and my photographs are basically dark Jewish humor.","I thought it would be good not to hide the fact that you're taking a photograph, and have people react and come in close and also make a commentary on what's being photographed: 'This is a photo, this is my point of view.'","I thought it would be a good idea to look at New York with this half-European, half-native eye and really do something to get back at this city that I thought really gave me a hard time when I grew up.","I always thought I was going to be an artist. I used to draw, and I would read Russian novels until 3 or 4 in the morning.","If I didn't have to earn a living somehow, I would never have taken a fashion photograph in my life.","When I was a kid in New York, long before saturation sports coverage, the world heavyweight championship was, with the baseball World Series, the great national event.","If a film is a real knockout like 'Raging Bull,' it does not matter that it might not have happened like that.","The kinetic quality of New York, the kids, dirt, madness - I tried to find a photographic style that would come close to it. So I cropped, blurred, played with the negatives.","I had an experience that was kind of backward. Instead of thinking that photography was a step down, it brought me a step up, to transpose and modify things.","This is supposed to be the Big Apple, with neighborhoods where the houses are all good-looking and the skyscrapers and everything. But to me, New York is kind of shoddy and uncomfortable.","People didn't object to me taking their photo. It was something everybody thought was their due: to be King for a Day, win the lottery and be photographed.","The best critics of America are Americans.","My complaint is that Americans drive me crazy, and the politics drive me crazy.","I didn't really know who Cassius Clay was. I just wanted to show America through a heavyweight championship fight. Ever since my childhood, I'd been fascinated by the way the whole country becomes polarised around this event.","Leger was not only the first artist I ever met but also the first pop artist, and he blew our minds.","Most of the other soldiers were older than me and sent money back to their families, so they were more prudent.","Don't have rules, taboos, or limits.","I like festivals of all kinds: in 1969, I made a film about the first Pan-African festival in Algiers, which celebrated the countries that had been liberated 10 years earlier. There was a tremendous feeling of kinship.","The English are very exotic to me.","In the late Fifties and early Sixties, I used to think that most of these fashion creators weren't that great, and if the photograph was good, it was mostly thanks to the photographer.","I did a film on Muhammad Ali before he was champion. I was there when he became champion in 1964. I was happy to be able to document the development of a real American hero.","I find it satisfying that what I've done in photography has had so much influence in how people take photographs and what they look at and how they look at things.","You do things for yourself, and you do things for other people, and you hope that these things coincide.","I think that Damien Hirst putting a shark in a bath of formaldehyde is nothing.","What's very funny is when you see amateurs filming something, they do some things no professionals would dare to do. They instinctively do things that are very avant-garde and useful.","In America, kids would go to college and get out and buy a second-hand car and go across the country and discover America. I never did that; I went from New York to Paris, and New York was my America.","I was making a film on Muhammad Ali in 1964, and I went to Miami to film everything around the fight for the world championship with Sonny Liston. I had the good luck of flying down to Miami, and there was one empty seat, and the guy sitting next to this empty seat was Malcolm X.","I was fascinated by the Black Panthers because I'd been in contact with the Nation of Islam, thanks to Muhammad Ali, and their way of talking was that the whites were the devil, and they'd get rid of them once they took over.","When I made 'Polly Maggoo,' it was more or less the end of this collaboration with 'Vogue' because I made a caricature of the editor-in-chief and the fashion people, so they didn't really adore me.","I always dreamed of working in Paris, of going to the Coupole and slapping Picasso or Giacometti on the shoulder.","My father was convinced that America was the greatest place in the world. I'm afraid I didn't have the family I would have dreamed of.","I had no real respect for good technique because I didn't know what it was. I was self-taught, so that stuff didn't matter to me.","I wasn't part of any movement. I was working alone, following my instinct.","Photography led me to experiment in graphic work and, actually, painting.","I'm known for fashion photographs, but fashion photographs were mostly a joke for me. In 'Vogue,' girls were playing at being duchesses, but they were actually from Flatbush, Brooklyn. They would play duchesses, and I would play Cecil Beaton.","I discovered that I could do whatever I wanted with a negative in a darkroom and an enlarger.","The digital camera takes photographs in practically no light: it will dig out the least bit of light available. I was amazed to see the results of photographs that I wouldn't take ordinarily. That's the advantage of digital photography.","I grew up in Manhattan. For Manhattanites, Brooklyn was the sticks, a second-rate civilization. My friends and I, we were so snobby. Living in the Bronx or Brooklyn was incredible... for me, that was like a foreign country.","My grandfather and his wife came to America at the end of the 19th century from Hungary. Everyone started out on the Lower East Side. They became embourgeoise and would move to the Upper West Side. Then, if they'd make money, they'd move to Park Avenue. Their kids would become artists and move down to the Lower East Side and the Village.","As a kid, I wanted to be part of the Lost Generation who came to France."],"William Kraft":["What I've learned is that it's okay to take from heroes, such as Debussy, but it has to be filtered through my own personality so that ultimately it's me.","You never write down to the people - you write the best you can with the hope that someone else will feel the same way.","If I think something is beautiful, there must be somebody out there who will agree with me.","When you go to the theater, if you're really involved in the play, you don't think about it - you're in it."],"William Kunstler":["When we talk about justice in America we're really talking about justice brought about by the people, not by judges who are tools of the establishment or prosecutors who are are equally tools of the establishment or the wardens or the police officers.","But on the other hand government takes away a certain amount of liberty and in some countries it takes away all of liberty. And it will, everywhere, if people who fight government do not fight government any longer.","This is New York, and there's no law against being annoying.","Once the troops move into Cambodia, the colleges and universities of this country were on the verge of civil war. Many closed down. The students were up in arms. And it looked very much like there were going to be real problems in this country.","So May 4th in the labor movement has always been an important date.","Four years earlier I had been selected, with Kay Boyle, the writer, and a number of others, to go to Cambodia and come back and prove that there were no sanctuaries in that country.","Our bodies must always be wherever that struggle and the moment we forget that, the moment we become lazy, the moment we sit back, then then the evil ones do their ordained tasks to us.","At first blush, it seems that the young people who were shot down in the parking lot at the base of Blanket Hill gave up their lives for a dream that died with them.","But he said Blanket Hill should be a national monument. And so we came out of his chambers feeling, though while we had lost to the powers of darkness, we had at least shown one Federal Judge what the right path would have been.","We have become the charnel house of the Western World.","May 4th is a particularly memorable day in American history because 84 years to the day before May 4, 1970, there was another demonstration at the Haymarket Square in Chicago.","On the unofficial level it was a glorious moment in our national life because young people decided that this had to stop, that they could no longer stand the shedding of blood in this tragic adventure in Southeast Asia.","A dog is like a liberal. He wants to please everybody. A cat really doesn't need to know that everybody loves him."],"William L. Jenkins":["Since the turn of the 20th century, members of the Jewish community in Upper East Tennessee and Southwest Virginia have been meeting together to celebrate and worship.","Unfortunately, the current format for this lottery program are subject to fraud and abuse and leave our nation exposed to those who may seek to do harm on American soil.","The current diversity visa program does a disservice to our immigration policy and to those immigrants who have moved through the more traditional process that allows them to lawfully reside in this country.","Many states rely on sales tax as their principle source of revenue and do not have a State income tax.","The stories have been told so often by those of us who supported President Reagan over the years that they seem mundane, almost like a fictional novel or a movie script.","Throughout his life, Ronald Reagan believed America is capable of great things and its people could and would lead the way if left unburdened by taxation and regulation.","Often dismissed or underestimated by political opponents, President Reagan had the most valuable weapon in the political arsenal: a bond with the people.","In 1980, a nation in need of change selected Ronald Reagan to restore the shine to a tarnished America.","Over the course of two terms, President Reagan revolutionized the Republican Party and changed the political atmosphere in a way still being felt today.","President Reagan always gave the credit to the American people and American ideals. He treated his job as a valuable temporary loan from the American people, a loan that should be respected and returned with dutiful appreciation.","Ronald Reagan's well documented final battles with Alzheimer's disease were fought with the same conviction and courage that his many public battles were fought."],"William Labov":["This African American Vernacular English shares most of its grammar and vocabulary with other dialects of English. But it is distinct in many ways, and it is more different from standard English than any other dialect spoken in continental North America.","We focus upon pairs of words very often which are the same in some areas and different in other areas.","Well, American dialects have been studied for a hundred years or so.","But unlike European countries, America has never finished a map of the United States, only the eastern United States is covered and a few spots here and there.","I am now completing research supported by NSF and NEH that is mapping changes in the English language through all of North America, for both mainstream and minority communities.","It appears that the present-day form of African American English is not the inheritance of the period of slavery, but the creation of the second half of the 20th century.","An important aspect of the current situation is the strong social reaction against suggestions that the home language of African American children be used in the first steps of learning to read and write.","And instead of getting a pepper-and-salt effect, we find very clear and sharp divisions between the dialects of the United States, which are getting more different from each other as time goes on.","However, research in the years that followed found that in many of its important features, African American Vernacular English was becoming not less, but more different from other dialects."],"William Lacy Clay, Jr.":["It is apparent, if you go back through our history, that the grand juries of the criminal justice system do not value black lives.","Just to assassinate Michael Brown's character is wrong.","Michael Brown happened to be black. Trayvon Martin happened to be black. Eric Garner was a black man. So this pattern continues over and over.","A militarized police force facing down innocent protesters with sniper rifles and machine guns is totally unacceptable in America.","I went to Ferguson and walked with the demonstrators and saw this heavily armed police force, tactical units pointing sniper rifles at my constituents who were there exercising their constitutional rights.","I made a promise to Michael Brown's parents that I would do everything to bring all of the resources of the federal government to this investigation so that it is transparent; so that it is a viable investigation, and we get to the truth.","I have absolutely no confidence in the Ferguson police, the county prosecutor.","It's an issue that we need to have a national discussion about, the militarization of local police forces, and then when they are used to quell peaceful demonstration. Then we have a problem, and especially around this entire case of the murder of Michael Brown at the hands of a Ferguson police officer.","We have to have a national conversation about how police forces should interact with the African-American community, who happens to be paying their salary, who want to be served and protected, who these officers are take an oath to do so.","I made a commitment and a promise to Ms. McSpadden, Michael Brown's mother, that I will pursue justice with the family at every avenue, be it on the federal level or at the state level.","It is critical that low-income consumers have access to alternative products and services such as rent-to-own. It gives working-class families opportunities to obtain decent household items without incurring the burden of debt.","Rent-to-own provides a vital service to millions of Americans. It is also critical for African-Americans, Latinos and other minorities to have access to alternative products and services, such as rent-to-own."],"William Lamb Melbourne":["It is safest to take the unpopular side in the first instance. Transit from the unpopular is easy... but from the popular to the unpopular is so steep and rugged that it is impossible to maintain it.","Neither man nor woman can be worth anything until they have discovered that they are fools.","What I want is men who will support me when I am in the wrong."],"William Landay":["Good stories are driven by conflict, tension, and high stakes.","I love sports, as all Bostonians seem to. I love books and movies, as all writers seem to.","I am interested in computers and technology, and art, photography, and design.","I can't say that I ever actually decided to become a writer. It kind of snuck up on me.","When I was 30 or so - by that time I had become an assistant D.A. - I decided I would try to write a novel. To be clear: I did not decide to become a novelist. Honestly, it never crossed my mind that I could actually earn a living as a professional novelist.","I don't ever write with a particular audience in mind. I just write books that please me.","Crime and legal stories, broadly speaking, are just where my interest happens to lie.","You can write a great book and be ignored. Literary history is full of classics that were under-appreciated in their own time.","I'm a bit of a tech geek myself.","Genes are not simple triggers. No one is hardwired to commit murder or any other crime. Our actions are always the result of stupendously complex gene-environment interactions, and environment is likely to remain the more important influence by far.","Well, I outline fanatically. I am a long thinker and a slow writer, though I am trying to get faster.","Probably careful plotting reflects my personality. I am meticulous by nature. I can't imagine speed-writing anything that happens to pop into my head."],"William Langewiesche":["You should not see the desert simply as some faraway place of little rain. There are many forms of thirst.","The mastery of the turn is the story of how aviation became practical as a means of transportation. It is the story of how the world became small."],"William Lashner":["I write novels with a lawyer as the hero, no matter how oxymoronic that might sound.","I try to write stories that are thrilling and full of mystery and funny all at the same time, stories that raise moral questions but come up with very few moral answers, stories that emotionally touch readers through the characters.","I like to think I'm writing in the tradition of Raymond Chandler, although I don't ape his style.","I don't trust novels with points, do you? If a novel is only about a point, the writer should just say it in as few words as possible so we can take it in and go back to watching 'The Bachelor' on television.","I'm going to book-and-author dinners, and I'm the author!","A sense of place is very important in writing.","When I write legally, I try to write very plain, very vanilla, very clear.","People read legal writing differently. When you're at the crux of a legal argument, every step is a step in the argument. The judge will see any holes. If you do that in fiction, it's too long and boring.","In fiction, the reader will make jumps with you. If you can make the reader make that leap with you, it's a thrilling moment for everyone."],"William Laud":["Behold, I am become a reproach to thy holy name, by serving any ambition and the sins of others; which though I did by the persuasion of other men, yet my own conscience did cheek and upbraid me in it.","The Lord receive my soul, and have mercy on me, and bless this kingdom with peace and charity, that there may not be this effusion of Christian blood amongst them.","Some hypocrites and seeming mortified men, that held down their heads, were like the little images that they place in the very bowing of the vaults of churches, that look as if they held up the church, but are but puppets."],"William Law":["He who has learned to pray has learned the greatest secret of a holy and happy life.","Be intent upon the perfection of the present day.","Self is the root, the tree, and the branches of all the evils of our fallen state.","Humility is nothing else but a right judgment of ourselves.","No education can be of true advantage to young women but that which trains them up in humble industry, in great plainness of living, in exact modesty of dress.","Faith is not a notion, but a real strong essential hunger, an attracting or magnetic desire of Christ, which as it proceeds from a seed of the divine nature in us, so it attracts and unites with its like.","Hell is nothing else but nature departed or excluded from the beam of divine light.","Love has no errors, for all errors are the want for love.","We must alter our lives in order to alter our hearts, for it is impossible to live one way and pray another.","If you have not chosen the Kingdom of God first, it will in the end make no difference what you have chosen instead.","Nothing hath separated us from God but our own will, or rather our own will is our separation from God.","This, and this alone, is Christianity, a universal holiness in every part of life, a heavenly wisdom in all our actions, not conforming to the spirit and temper of the world but turning all worldly enjoyments into means of piety and devotion to God.","Love and pity and wish well to every soul in the world; dwell in love, and then you dwell in God.","What could begin to deny self, if there were not something in man different from self?","Ask what Time is, it is nothing else but something of eternal duration become finite, measurable and transitory.","What can you conceive more silly and extravagant than to suppose a man racking his brains, and studying night and day how to fly?","God seeth different abilities and frailties of men, which may move His goodness to be merciful to their different improvements in virtue.","Perfection does not consist in any singular state or condition of life, or in any particular set of duties, but in holy and religious conduct of ourselves in every state of Life.","All people desire what they believe will make them happy. If a person is not full of desire for God, we can only conclude that he is engaged with another happiness.","Death is not more certainly a separation of our souls from our bodies than the Christian life is a separation of our souls from worldly tempers, vain indulgences, and unnecessary cares."],"William Least Heat-Moon":["Be careful going in search of adventure - it's ridiculously easy to find.","When you're travelling, you are what you are right there and then. People don't have your past to hold against you. No yesterdays on the road.","I've read that a naked eye can see six thousand stars in the hundred billion galaxies, but I couldn't believe it, what with the sky white with starlight. I saw a million stars with one eye and two million with both.","The thing that overwhelms me when I go out now is the sprawlation of America.","I simply couldn't make it without a copilot.","I did learn what I didn't know I wanted to know.","What you've done becomes the judge of what you're going to do - especially in other people's minds.

It's a river that immediately presents to the traveler, 'I am a grandfather spirit.

You dig up a marvelous discovery. Now I ask you, who should get the credit: the director or the digger?","For me, the creative process, first of all, requires a good nine hours of sleep a night. Second, it must not be pushed by the need to produce practical applications.","The problem is how do molecules react.

That means you can explore much more complicated systems, much more complicated reactions.","There's a lot of music in my life, and I found it a very important part of my life.","I learned from Linus Pauling it's not a disgrace in science to publish something that's wrong. What's bad is to publish something that's not very interesting.","The artist must ask you to think of the world in a different way, and sometimes it's a more abstract way; sometimes it's a completely different kind of colouring.","A lot of people think the orchestra is playing and the conductor doesn't do very much, but the conductor's the person that gives shape to the music, gets the phrasing, and if he has really fine musicians in solo spots, the question is does he try to help them phrase, or does he let them go?","I think the intuitive processes of discovery are the same, very much the same, in the arts as in the sciences."],"William Lloyd Garrison":["Wherever there is a human being, I see God-given rights inherent in that being, whatever may be the sex or complexion.","My country is the world; my countrymen are mankind.","With reasonable men, I will reason; with humane men I will plead; but to tyrants I will give no quarter, nor waste arguments where they will certainly be lost.","Are right and wrong convertible terms, dependant upon popular opinion?","Enslave the liberty of but one human being and the liberties of the world are put in peril.","The apathy of the people is enough to make every statue leap from its pedestal and hasten the resurrection of the dead.","I am accused of using hard language.

But what a pitiful detail of grievances does this document present in comparison with the wrongs which our slaves endure!","We may be personally defeated, but our principles never!","If the State cannot survive the anti-slavery agitation, then let the State perish. If the Church must be cast down by the strugglings of Humanity to be free, then let the Church fall and its fragments be scattered to the four winds of Heaven, never more to curse the earth.","I am in earnest - I will not equivocate - I will not excuse - I will not retreat a single inch - and I will be heard!","That which is not just is not law.","We are the friends of reform; but that is not reform, which, in curing one evil, threatens to inflict a thousand others.","Whether permitted to live to witness the abolition of slavery or not, I felt assured that, as I demanded nothing that was not clearly in accordance with justice and humanity, some time or other, if remembered at all, I should stand vindicated in the eyes of my countrymen.","If nations perish, it is not because of their devotion to liberty, but for their disregard of its requirements.","Let not those who say that the path of obedience is a dangerous one claim to believe in the living and true God. They deny his omniscience, omnipresence, omnipotence. It is his will that the bands of wickedness should be loosed, the heavy burdens of tyranny undone, the oppressed set free.","Let anti-slavery charity boxes stand uppermost among those for missionary, tract and educational purposes. On this subject, Christians have been asleep; let them shake off their slumbers and arm for the holy contest.","You can not possibly have a broader basis for government than that which includes all the people, with all their rights in their hands, and with an equal power to maintain their rights.","The compact which exists between the North and the South is a covenant with death and an agreement with hell.","The success of any great moral enterprise does not depend upon numbers.","If all our agents would abridge their speeches one half, I am satisfied the effect produced would be much greater. The 'art of leaving off' at the right time, and in the right place, is one of the most difficult things to learn.","I do not believe that God has created us under this dire necessity to toil, like beasts, to sustain life. I believe it is his will that we should hold absolute mastery over time, so as to devote it mainly to intellectual and moral improvement, domestic enjoyment, and social intercourse.","Surely, nothing can be more dangerous than the doctrine that the moral obligations of men change with the latitude and longitude of a place.","The existing governments of the world are the consequence of disobedience to the commands of God. But Christ came to bring men back to obedience by a new and living way."],"William Lucking":["Don't even think of acting as a profession unless not doing it would cause you to sicken and waste away.","I had a terrible motorcycle accident, in San Francisco as matter of fact.

I rode horses pretty well. I just didn't like doing it.","It always amazes me when people go rent horses and ride them. You mean you want me to pay you to ride a horse?"],"William Lyon Mackenzie King":["Conscription if necessary, but not necessarily conscription.","From the outset of the war, the Canadian people have clearly shown that it is their desire to help in every way to make Canada's war effort as effective as possible.","Far more has been accomplished for the welfare and progress of mankind by preventing bad actions than by doing good ones.","Where there is little or no public opinion, there is likely to be bad government, which sooner or later becomes autocratic government.","Regardless of what one's attitude towards prohibition may be, temperance is something against which, at a time of war, no reasonable protest can be made.","It is what we prevent, rather than what we do that counts most in Government.","Self-denial and self-discipline, however, will be recognized as the outstanding qualities of a good soldier.","Nor do we begin to have a clear appreciation of what the increase in consumption of alcoholic beverages in wartime means in increased risk, and in loss of efficiency to the fighting and working forces of the country.","Since the outbreak of war, there has been in our country a steady increase in the consumption of spirits, wine and beer. It is estimated that in dollar volume, the annual outlay is now practically double what it was before the war.","Temperance is essential, if the services of men and women are to be employed to the best and most useful effect according, to the physical capacity and ability of each. Nothing less will assure a total effort.","If the military might of Germany and Japan are ultimately to be crushed, the United Nations, one and all, must definitely and urgently strive toward a total war effort.","Until the control of the issue of currency and credit is restored to government and recognized as its most conspicuous and sacred responsibility, all talks of the sovereignty of Parliament and of democracy is idle and futile.","Every hour of useful work is precious.","Only the man who disciplines himself strictly can stand for long the terrific pace of modern war.","I really believe my greatest service is in the many unwise steps I prevent.","As to the advantages of temperance in the training of the armed forces and of its benefits to the members of the forces themselves, there can be no doubt in the world.","If I am outspoken of the dangers of intemperance to members of our armed forces, it is because we are all especially concerned for the welfare of those who are risking their lives in the cause of freedom.","No one will deny that the excessive use of alcohol and alcoholic beverages would do more than any other single factor to make impossible a total war effort.","Fortunately, the Canadian people in all their habits, are essentially a temperate people.","The greatly increased consumption of alcoholic beverages is very largely a direct result of the increased purchasing power created by wartime expenditures.","On behalf of the federal government, I wish now publicly to appeal to the provinces to lend their co-operation in furthering our country's war effort by effecting at as early a date as may be possible this much needed restriction.","For one cause or another, it has become necessary to impose restrictions upon the use of many commodities, including not a few of the necessities of life.","Few would venture to deny the advantages of temperance in increasing the efficiency of a nation at war.","I would not wish to imply that most industrial accidents are due to intemperance. But, certainly, temperance has never failed to reduce their number.","The increased consumption of alcoholic beverages in Canada since the outbreak of war is one evidence of this.","Once a nation parts with the control of its credit, it matters not who makes the laws.","Usury once in control will wreck the nation.","Each year, therefore, a dollar spent on alcoholic beverages has purchased a smaller quantity.","In the twelve months immediately preceding the outbreak; of war, the quantity of spirits, both domestic and imported released for sale in Canada, amounted to over three and a half million proof gallons.","When gasoline and rubber are rationed, electric power and transport facilities are becoming increasingly scarce, and manpower shortages are developing, it is difficult for people to understand their increased use for other than the most vital needs of war.","Workers in industry are the partners in war of the fighting forces.","The anxiety of most parents in seeing their sons and daughters enlist does not lie only in the fear of the physical dangers they may encounter.","Let it be remembered, too, that at a time of war, nearly every one is under great strain.","Just when we most need to be clearheaded, in order to face the hard facts before us, there is all too frequently a very real inclination to give way to dangerous tendencies merely as an escape from realities.","There can be little doubt that absence from work, and inefficient work, are frequently due to intemperance."],"William Lyon Phelps":["If at first you don't succeed, find out if the loser gets anything.","Those who decide to use leisure as a means of mental development, who love good music, good books, good pictures, good plays, good company, good conversation - what are they?

The happiest person is the person who thinks the most interesting thoughts, and we grow happier as we grow older.","Whenever it is possible, a boy should choose some occupation which he should do even if he did not need the money.","The fear of life is the favorite disease of the 20th century.","In a start-up company, you basically throw out all assumptions every three weeks.","A bibliophile of little means is likely to suffer often.

Daley":["Now that Donald Trump has won the presidency despite losing the popular vote, there's a growing cry to rethink, or even abolish, the electoral college. This would be a mistake.","While imperfect, the electoral college has generally served the republic well. It forces candidates to campaign in a variety of closely contested races, where political debate is typically robust.","When the manufacturing decline began in earnest in 2001, the main culprits were the offshoring of jobs to China, with which we have no trade deal, and automation.","Sanders insists the party adopt 'the most progressive platform ever passed' at its Philadelphia convention. Since when does the runner-up get to dictate the platform?","In my opinion, it is not in our interest to have complicated negotiations with a region, and then have to follow it up with 535 negotiations at home. I have experienced recounts, and it is better to vote once.","The Microsoft actions announced today are exactly the kinds of industry initiatives we need. Microsoft is using its resources to bring real privacy protection to Internet users by creating incentives for more websites to provide strong privacy protection.","There is no question of the benefits that opening a market of a billion people will bring to American businesses. But as I said last year, this will test China and the world trade system.","Contrary to what most people think, there is a Rich Daley under Mayor Daley.","Some people would like the world to go back to the 1950s.","Most people who talk about either entitlement cuts or revenue - when you have to put pen to paper, it is much more difficult.","Politics is all about relationships, people. A lot of it's emotional. It's not rocket science.","Bernie Sanders is making a big and potentially dangerous mistake with his continuing insistence on changes to the Democratic Party's rules and platform. I should know. As chairman of Al Gore's 2000 presidential campaign, I understand too well where such ideological stubbornness can lead.","It's logical and fair to allow only registered or self-identified Democrats to choose their party's nominee (although numerous states do have open primaries). Letting more non-Democrats choose the nominee doesn't guarantee success in a November general election. And it does nothing to encourage people to join and work for the party.","Centrist voters typically decide general elections, so hard-left or hard-right platforms don't help.","Our focus must be on making America the best place on earth to do business.","I got through at Ignatius. I did OK, not great in any of my academic endeavors.","There are 14 Cabinet spots, and God only knows how many hundreds of people want them.","There is no room for politics in the Commerce Department.","Commerce was the best job I could ever have.","President Obama came into office in '08 with the belief that - and the public's belief in him - that he was moderate, that he wasn't a big spender.","No one knows the Senate better than Joe Biden; he lived there for 35 years.","It's been proven in Washington: It's very hard to negotiate and try to get a deal done in public.","It sounds good to say, 'We're going to do this,' on C-SPAN, but try to do that in real life, and it's not going to work.","Young people - motivating them in any election is hard to do.","We can't give the impression to our allies or friends in Asia that because the president is against TPP... that therefore, economically, we're going to pull away from Asia.","Trump is a different politician. He was a different businessman. His campaign was different. What you saw in his campaign is what you're going to see in his presidency.","If anything, the Democrats' salvation may lie in the fact that Republicans seem even more hell-bent on allowing their radical wing to drag the party away from the center.","There are some who want to move us back to the days when we were protectionists and keep all goods off our shores.","There's a growing sense among large corporations that to solve global problems like climate change, the responsibility can't fall just on the government. The business community has to be a big piece of that.","You can use all the flowery words in the dictionary, but sooner or later, you have to let people know where you stand.","I was Al Gore's campaign chairman in 2000, when he won a half-million more votes than George W. Bush but lost the presidency.","While a truly national third party wouldn't necessarily be bad, smaller niche parties are ill-suited to our federalist system.","There is no path to middle-class prosperity without tearing down barriers to American exports.","If we don't set the rules for commerce in the Asia-Pacific region, China will.","The mistake we made in the 1990s was overestimating the potential of NAFTA's positive impact.","As a pro-business Democrat, I understand the obligations of publicly traded companies to maximize returns to shareholders.","When a state offers your company an attractive package of incentives to relocate, you have to look at it, and if it significantly boosts your bottom line, you have to take it or answer to your investors.","Business leaders should show what our political leaders seem to lack - that is, a common-sense view of the times.","Illinois needs a real strategy for job creation that grows the economy over the long term with high-wage jobs that rebuild the middle class.","Most Republicans and the business community extol the virtues of trade, depicting it as an engine of economic progress, while most Democrats and unions attack the exportation of American jobs, claiming that trade agreements are destroying our economy.","I know something about trade agreements. I was proud to help President Clinton pass the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1993 and create what is still the world's largest free-trade area, linking 426 million people and more than $12 trillion of goods and services.","As commerce secretary, I led the Clinton administration's effort to ensure China's entry into the World Trade Organization and the permanent normalization of trade between the U.S. and China - steps that produced a 76 percent increase in U.S. exports to China in just three years.","The reason CAFTA should be enacted is not economic benefits: it is national security.","Palin's blatant lack of competence and preparedness needs no belaboring. What's critical is that substantive, serious Republican leaders either wouldn't or couldn't declare, before or after the election, 'This is not what our party stands for. We can and must do better.'","Whether McCain actively sought Palin in 2008 or passively yielded to aides' pressure, he set a new standard for GOP candidates who rely on lots of sizzle and little substance.","The Republican establishment's 2008 embrace of Palin set an irresponsibly low bar. Coincidence or not, a batch of nonsense-spewing, hard-right candidates quickly followed, often to disastrous effect.","Party leaders aren't responsible for every candidate's gaffe.","Trade is an integral part of our foreign policy.","Obviously in a campaign, people say lots of things that they find, when they get in the office, life's a little different.","The chief of staff has to reflect and sometimes complement the strengths of the president he serves.","A chief of staff has to reflect the president's governing style.","As president, you can't just say, 'I want this,' or, 'Do that.' A president has to lead the American people to where he wants to go, and the chief of staff needs to help him get it done.","What comes into the Oval Office are not the good or easy decisions. The easy decisions are made elsewhere. The things that make it to the Oval are always the hard ones.","Lots of people throw around phrases of 'no-fly zone,' and they talk about it as though it's just a game - a video game or something. Some people who throw that line out have no idea what they're talking about.","Bob Gates understands the difficulty of going to war.

To love and lose, the next best.","People who do not know how to laugh are always pompous and self-conceited.","Let a man who has to make his fortune in life remember this maxim: Attacking is the only secret. Dare and the world yields, or if it beats you sometimes, dare it again and you will succeed.","It is only hope which is real, and reality is a bitterness and a deceit.","'Tis strange what a man may do, and a woman yet think him an angel.","People hate as they love, unreasonably.","If a secret history of books could be written, and the author's private thoughts and meanings noted down alongside of his story, how many insipid volumes would become interesting, and dull tales excite the reader!","Kindnesses are easily forgotten; but injuries! what worthy man does not keep those in mind?","What money is better bestowed than that of a schoolboy's tip? How the kindness is recalled by the recipient in after days! It blesses him that gives and him that takes.","It is best to love wisely, no doubt; but to love foolishly is better than not to be able to love at all.","I would rather make my name than inherit it.","I never knew whether to pity or congratulate a man on coming to his senses.","There are many sham diamonds in this life which pass for real, and vice versa.","Except for the young or very happy, I can't say I am sorry for anyone who dies.","Despair is perfectly compatible with a good dinner, I promise you.","It is to the middle-class we must look for the safety of England.","Next to the young, I suppose the very old are the most selfish.","Remember, it's as easy to marry a rich woman as a poor woman.","The book of female logic is blotted all over with tears, and Justice in their courts is forever in a passion.","It is impossible, in our condition of Society, not to be sometimes a Snob."],"William Manchester":["I wondered vaguely if this was when it would end, whether I would pull up tonight's darkness like a quilt and be dead and at peace evermore.","He was a great thundering paradox of a man.","An Edwardian lady in full dress was a wonder to behold, and her preparations for viewing were awesome.","Japanese naval officers in dress whites are frequent guests at Pearl Harbor's officers' mess and are very polite.

Between that and the scripts I've read as an actor, and I'm a writer as well, I think I have a pretty good sense about whether the bones of a story are there and whether the structure is intact.","I guess every actor has certain emotions they can access easier than others.","I've made a number of independent films that didn't receive theatrical distribution, that a lot of people haven't heard of, and as a result, I've conditioned myself to go into small independent films with the expectation that they will not, and therefore, I have to find my reward elsewhere.","I love classical music and often listen to symphonies or opera in the morning.","I love sci-fi, especially when it thrives on a thought-provoking story, rather than explosions.","I can be a bit of a science geek. I tend more towards reading about brain science, neuroscience.","I was an English major, so I love discussing possibilities and alternate theories.","I would not call myself Catholic anymore, but I went to 16 years of Catholic school: grade school, high school and college.","If you think about filmmaking as an entire spectrum, starting with the writer and ending with maybe the marketing department, the actor's contribution is a rather slender band."],"William Masters":["Sex is a natural function.

But it does seek to establish truth. And upon this truth morality can be built."],"William McDonough":["Design is inherently optimistic. That is its power.","I see that idea that we need a new form as something critical. I mean, we do need to invent and not be benchmarking all the time. That's important to me.","I think the job of an original designer is to inspire.","I suggest we take our heads out of the tar sands and look up to see the sun. We don't own it, but it provides us all with great, endless value. So, too, the wind. These free, renewable sources of 'energy currency' are perfect partners to what we own together.","We achieved our mission to the moon.

Kids do art for fun. It's playing.","If you continue to act like an artist as you get older, you'll increasingly feel pressure. People will question your actions.","The magic question is, 'What for?'

It shows you that there is no perfection. There is light, and there is shadow. Everything is in half tint.","Painting is the only universal language. All nature is creation's picture book. Painting alone can describe every thing which can be seen, and suggest every emotion which can be felt. Art reaches back into the babyhood of time, and is man's only lasting monument.","It's impossible to make a picture without values. Values are the basis. If they are not, tell me what is the basis.","You can always draw as well as you know how to.

The feeling of rest is perfect. There's no more nagging, no more pain!","What is nobler than a man wresting and wringing his bread from the stubborn soil by the sweat of his brow and the break of his back for his wife and children!","How are we going to make painters by lecturing to them? We are going to make questioners, doubters, and talkers. We are going to make painters by painting ourselves, and by showing the paintings of others. By working frankly from our convictions, we are going to make them work frankly from theirs.","When an artist leaves his work to amuse people, he loses his time and their respect. If people are to be amused by artists, it must be by employing them in their legitimate occupation.","I don't like persuaded sitters. I never could paint a cat if the cat had any scruples, religious, superstitious, or otherwise, about sitting.","Nature is economical. She puts her lights and darks only where she needs them.","The artist is an interpreter of Nature. People learn to love Nature through pictures. To the artist, nothing is in vain; nothing beneath his notice. If he is great enough, he will exalt every subject which he treats.","There is force and vitality in a first sketch from life which the after-work rarely has. You want a picture to seize you as forcibly as if a man had seized you by the shoulder! It should impress you like reality!","Don't put needless expense into painting a head! Don't try to match tints! Rose and pearly colours blend into each other so that no one can unite them if painted separately. Keep the impression of your subject as one thing!","How are things visible? Can you see an egg against a white background? Not by drawing a line around it can you make it evident.","Most of us live for the critic, and he lives on us. He doesn't sacrifice himself. He gets so much a line for writing a criticism.

The parrots would exchange with the nightingales, and what a farce it would be!"],"William Morris":["The true secret of happiness lies in taking a genuine interest in all the details of daily life.","Have nothing in your house that you do not know to be useful, or believe to be beautiful.","Not on one strand are all life's jewels strung.","History has remembered the kings and warriors, because they destroyed; art has remembered the people, because they created.","The past is not dead, it is living in us, and will be alive in the future which we are now helping to make.","I want a real revolution, a real change in society: society, a great organic mass of well-regulated forces used for the bringing-about a happy life for all.","The reward of labour is life. Is that not enough?","We shall not be happy unless we live like good animals, unless we enjoy the exercise of the ordinary functions of life: eating, sleeping, loving, walking, running, swimming, riding, sailing.","A man at work, making something which he feels will exist because he is working at it and wills it, is exercising the energies of his mind and soul as well as of his body. Memory and imagination help him as he works.","Apart from the desire to produce beautiful things, the leading passion of my life has been and is hatred of modern civilization.","It took me years to understand that words are often as important as experience, because words make experience last.","I do not want art for a few any more than education for a few, or freedom for a few.","So long as the system of competition in the production and exchange of the means of life goes on, the degradation of the arts will go on; and if that system is to last for ever, then art is doomed, and will surely die; that is to say, civilization will die.","No man is good enough to be another's master.","I pondered all these things, and how men fight and lose the battle, and the thing that they fought for comes about in spite of their defeat, and when it comes turns out not to be what they meant, and other men have to fight for what they meant under another name.","If you cannot learn to love real art, at least learn to hate sham art and reject it.","How often it consoles me to think of barbarism once more flooding the world, and real feelings and passions, however rudimentary, taking the place of our wretched hypocrisies.","Happy as we are, times may alter; we may be bitten with some impulse towards change, and many things may seem too wonderful for us to resist, too exciting not to catch at, if we do not know that they are but phases of what has been before and withal ruinous, deceitful, and sordid.","I don't remember being taught to read, and by the time I was seven years old, I had read a very great many books, good, bad, and indifferent.","We are living in a epoch where there is combat between commercialism, or the system of reckless waste, and communism, or the system of neighbourly common sense.","It is right and necessary that all should have work to do which shall be worth doing and be of itself pleasant to do, and which should be done under such conditions as would make it neither over-wearisome nor over-anxious.","I can't enter into politico-social subjects with any interest, for on the whole, I see that things are in a muddle, and I have no power or vocation to set them right in ever so little a degree.","To do nothing but grumble and not to act - that is throwing away one's life.","Give me love and work - these two only.","I am going, if I can, to be an architect, and I am too old already, and there is no time to lose."],"William Moseley":["What I hope is that I don't just become 'Peter from 'The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe.' I want to try and do something else to be a good actor and a respected actor.","My mom used to call us 'free range kids,' like free range chickens... We roamed the countryside.","I would really love theater. I would love to do Shakespeare, that would be amazing. You know, it's whatever really comes my way.","'Narnia' has opened my eyes to a lot of things. I feel lucky that I'm able to travel; I'm not stuck in my hometown, meeting the same kind of girls and saying hi to the same people, week after week. There are so many interesting, intelligent girls out there.","I remember thinking when I was younger - we used to take holidays to Spain and France, and I just thought I was never going to get further than Spain or France. I really didn't when I was younger. And then I started auditioning for 'Narnia,' and the first thing when I got the part was go straight to New Zealand, halfway around the world.","Where I live is about an hour and a half West of London. I live in the countryside... It's a classic little village, and it's idyllic in a lot of ways.","I used to love 'The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe,' and I can still remember listening to them before I would fall asleep. I can remember the first ten minutes of the book perfectly, but whether I knew the rest of it was slightly more dicey.","The best thing about having brothers and sisters is that they're brutally honest. My brother just got the 'Narnia' game, and first thing he does is kill me in it! Six times, over and over again!","I can't imagine myself doing something like 'Narnia' again. I would love to do something with Ridley Scott, you know, some action/adventure or something like that. But I'd also love to do a dramatic piece. It's really just whatever you read and take to.","I'd love to do a Michel Gondry film. That would be ideal! I'd love to do an Almodovar film; you know, I think he's very, very talented. I don't care that people say he's pretentious. So what? He's a good director; he can be pretentious.","For me, my taste isn't limited to magical films. Whatever I read and I like, I go up for, and a lot of the time it's an American accent which can be quite trying, but I'm working on it as much as I can.","I used to not listen that much, but I've really learnt to listen to other people and to really listen to what they're saying. I've found, especially being on a film set, people have so many different stories; if you just listen, you can pick up so much stuff. I try to listen as much as I can.","I was up for 'Harry Potter' way, way back. But I don't quite fit the bill, I think.","It seems like they make every comic book into a film. 'Watchmen' is my favorite of all time."],"William Mougayar":["The blockchain cannot be described just as a revolution. It is a tsunami-like phenomenon, slowly advancing and gradually enveloping everything along its way by the force of its progression.","The old question 'Is it in the database?' will be replaced by 'Is it on the blockchain?'","The blockchain is custom-made for decentralizing trust and exchanging assets without central intermediaries. With the decentralization of trust, we will be able to exchange anything we own and challenge existing trusted authorities and custodians that typically held the keys to accessing our assets or verifying their authenticity.","You have to think of the blockchain as a new utility. It is a new utility network for moving value, moving assets.","In my opinion, one of the most exciting potentials of the blockchain relate to creating new business models, whether in public or in private settings. In most of these cases, the new models don't care for incumbents because they are mostly on a disruption quest.","In the blockchain world, each user can and should own their data, and 'central' players are less vulnerable to data losses and breaches.","The blockchain is an asset normalization platform that can enable a new liquidity in transactions, hence creating large networks of usage and value effects with benefits in speed, cost, quality, or outcomes.","The blockchain symbolizes a shift in power from the centers to the edges of the networks.","I am very excited about the prospect of using cryptocurrency, not just as a money equivalent, but using it as a way to earn something as a result of doing some type of work.","How do we create new value? You create value by running services on the blockchain.","If you have your own currency, you have your own governance, so each currency becomes their own mini-government. Mini-government is a big word, but it's a body that is governed in a decentralized manner where users have a say, where there's oversight and transparency.","If you think about the web, the web has been an incredible development platform, and everything today is developed on the web. In the future, everything is going to be developed with the blockchain in mind.","I'm looking forward to seeing more ICO projects provide increased clarity about the performance metrics expectations they plan to exhibit during their future adult lives in addition to the assumptive utility of that token they are selling.","The blockchain start-ups that have done ICOs are just at the beginning of something. Ask me how they are doing in a year or two years from now. I know for a fact it won't be any different from the statistics of all start-ups: 80% of them will not make it.","Big companies do not want to disrupt themselves. All they want to do is improve themselves. They see the blockchain as another IT project. It's going to save money; it's going improve a process here and there. It's not going to change their business.","As we prepare to enter the cryptoconomy, undoubtedly it looks fuzzy, foggy, risky, buggy, uncertain and unproven, but so did the Internet in 1995.","When (not if) regulators start looking at ICO deals they might want to investigate, they will likely start with the ones that exhibit weaknesses.","A blockchain-based startup could have a product/service as part of what they are developing, but their stride is best hit when they are also creating a self-sustaining circular economy that is supported by their own currency or tokens and where there is a transactional loop between earning and spending these tokens within their ecosystem.","A new DAO is like a startup. It requires a product/market fit, business model realization, and a lot of users/customers.","Many regulators are quick to apply existing compliance practices that treat tokens as a security, therefore elevating the barriers and costs of implementation for entrepreneurs.","Study how to write smart contracts, which is the basic unit of programming a blockchain for business purposes. It is the equivalent of being taught HTML and Java during the early Internet days. And master how to create assets or tokenize existing ones on a blockchain.","Government leaders should get up to speed on the blockchain by understanding it first and committing to exploring its potential.","An aftermath of real failures can make the whole blockchain ecosystem more resilient because it will result in revealing the boundaries and realities of what's possible, useful, absurd, impossible, repeatable, and scalable out of everything that appears plausible and innovative at the beginning.","If blockchain technologies ignore the eventuality of standards, we are going to see less adoption. Maybe we should think of the blockchain as a public-good utility and encourage an evolution that is not unlike the Internet's in terms of openness and neutrality of access.","As much as one would like to think that what China does doesn't matter, the reality is that when China sneezes at crypto, the rest of the world catches the cold.","What Bitcoin started is metamorphosing into something bigger: a 'crypto-tech'-driven economy with its own value creation, not unlike the Web's own economy. Welcome to the cryptoconomy.","China wants control, and China will get control. That's their default modus operandi. Crypto-Tech is no different than the Internet and Web businesses.","There is a new economy out there, what I call the Crypto-Tech Economy, that could be as big, if not bigger, than the web economy. So we have to be prepared for it.","Blockchain infiltration will be met with resistance because it is an extreme change.","The world is preoccupied with dissecting, analyzing and prognosticating on the blockchain's future; technologists, entrepreneurs, and enterprises are wondering if it is to be considered vitamin or poison.","Just like paying a toll to use a freeway, the token can be the pay-per-use rail for getting on the blockchain infrastructure or for using the product. This also ensures that users have skin in the game.","For the first time, companies can be their own payment processors without the cumbersome or costly aspects of traditional financial settlement options. Tokens offer a much lower barrier for processing end-to-end transactions inside a given market.","Owning a token bestows a right that results in product usage, a governance action, a given contribution, voting, or plain access to the product or market.","Ideally, it is important to communicate exactly when large amounts of tokens become unlocked and therefore available in public exchanges. It is a good practice to continuously update these exchanges with the right amount of tokens in circulation.","Tokens should not be listed before the start of the operations on the network, platform, or application. This is where many ICO's seem to have lost their ways, and that's risky.","With the influx of available cryptocapital that has become widely accessible, it's going to be interesting to watch what happens next, because companies now have the luxury of raising enough money to build simultaneously a product, a company, and an ecosystem.","If you haven't used Bitcoin first-hand, you may not get the inherent advantage of a quicker appreciation and understanding of its potential. Seeing assets move swiftly without intermediaries is an eye opening experience, and that is just a starting point.","Let's hope the Canadian public sector starts putting the blockchain on their agenda so we can see a significant difference in how government services are delivered.","ICOs cannot escape startup evolution characteristics. This means that their growth will be hard fought, hard earned, and hardly a walk in the park.","My advice to many ICOs is to start reading about startups and focus on the product, customer, and market as soon as the sale is over. And don't get distracted by post-ICO euphoria and the price of ETH or BTC.","The blockchain applications market is unravelling along a segmentation of activity that is spread along two sets of variables: private vs. public blockchains, and new vs. existing business models.","Public blockchains are almost like the public Internet, which is open and widely accessible. If you can get on the Internet, you will likely be able to get on a public blockchain via a specific application.","Few incumbents will succeed in deploying blockchain applications to enable new business models. The innovator's dilemma will prevail. Even if they aspire to, they must first get their feet wet within their business boundaries.","Crowdsourced funding via cryptocurrencies is a viable practice. A lot of good ideas and innovative companies are coming out of it. This segment is creating thousands of jobs and companies all over the world.","Cryptocurrencies are not evil and are not for money launderers and scammers. They are for entrepreneurs, technologists, change-the-world dreamers, and anyone who believes they can (and will) enable new business models, new types of organizations, and new ways to service consumers and businesses alike.","In the increasingly digital world, data is a valuable currency, yet as consumers, we control and own little of it. As consumers, we must ask what big companies do with our data, a question directed to both the online and traditional ones.","A token is not a short term carrot, nor a stick for that matter. Just having a token doesn't mean that you have a working business model attached with it.","If your user base engagement is fledgeling, a token may not be the panacea unless it is properly threaded into the product, and user behavior is accompanying the token utility.","The token itself is not your new business model. What the token enables for you and for your users is the key part to focus on.","Until there are tangible metrics for quantifying the real value of a token's utility, the gap between value and valuation will continue to defy conventional wisdom and conventional valuation methods.","Most blockchain platforms don't share that much in common, resulting in choice lock-ins, lack of interoperability, and potentially dead-ends that are hard to untangle.","In order to grow-up, blockchains will eventually need a lot of standards that are vendor- and solutions-agnostic. So many areas are ripe for standards developments: smart contracts, tokens, security, storage, messaging, identities, naming, record-keeping, and more.","Conceivably, blockchains could rely on a number of standards above the Internet's existing standards to allow a smooth bridging from one layer to another. That would be a breakthrough."],"William Moulton Marston":["Women's strong qualities have become despised because of their weakness. The obvious remedy is to create a feminine character with all the strength of Superman plus all the allure of a good and beautiful woman.","Realize what you really want. It stops you from chasing butterflies and puts you to work digging gold.","It's too bad for us 'literary' enthusiasts, but it's the truth nevertheless - pictures tell any story more effectively than words.","Not even girls want to be girls so long as our feminine archetype lacks force, strength, and power.","Every crisis offers you extra desired power.","Besides the practical knowledge which defeat offers, there are important personality profits to be taken.","Most of us actually stifle enough good impulses during the course of a day to change the current of our lives."],"William Mulholland":["There it is. Take it.","If there is an error of human judgment, I am the human.","I envy the dead."],"William Nicholson":["Experience: that most brutal of teachers. But you learn, my God do you learn.","When I began to write seriously, 40 years ago now, my chosen form was the novel.","Madly, futilely, I wrote novel after novel, eight in all, that failed to find a publisher. I persisted because for me the novel was the supreme literary form - not just one among many, not a relic of the past, but the way we communicate to one another the subtlest truths about this business of living.","Why should I be honored? Don't I have enough attention, comfort and power already?","Everyone deserves to be the hero of a novel.","There is this notion that the lives of the comfortable-off middle class don't merit being treated seriously and with compassion.","A well-off plastic surgeon can suffer just as much as an Irish lad who has been abused or whatever.","There are dozens of great American writers who write about the family.","My study is a converted garage which is largely lined with bookshelves and cardboard boxes filled with manuscripts of my film scripts, plays and books."],"William O'Neill":["It's kind of a terrible irony, in a way, that the solution to America's problems was World War II.","The 1930s had been a time of tremendous economic distress. And the unemployment rate was enormously high by any historic standard.","Meeting all walks of life, it broadened your horizons, let's say that.","I've never professed to be an intellectual. I don't try to be.","I've had the school of hard knocks, and I've worked my way up to be the governor of this great state of Connecticut."],"William O. Douglas":["Marriage is a coming together for better or for worse, hopefully enduring, and intimate to the degree of being sacred.","As nightfall does not come at once, neither does oppression. In both instances, there is a twilight when everything remains seemingly unchanged, and it is in such a twilight that we all must be most aware of change in the air - however slight - lest we become unwitting victims of darkness.","Common sense often makes good law.","Free speech is not to be regulated like diseased cattle and impure butter. The audience that hissed yesterday may applaud today, even for the same performance.","The liberties of none are safe unless the liberties of all are protected.","The 5th Amendment is an old friend and a good friend. one of the great landmarks in men's struggle to be free of tyranny, to be decent and civilized.","At the constitutional level where we work, 90 percent of any decision is emotional. The rational part of us supplies the reasons for supporting our predilections.","Since when have we Americans been expected to bow submissively to authority and speak with awe and reverence to those who represent us?","We do not sit as a superlegislature to weigh the wisdom of legislation.","We are a religious people whose institutions presuppose a Supreme Being.","The association promotes a way of life, not causes; a harmony in living, not political faiths; a bilateral loyalty, not commercial or social projects. Yet it is an association for as noble a purpose as any involved in any prior decisions.","Tell the FBI that the kidnappers should pick out a judge that Nixon wants back.","No patent medicine was ever put to wider and more varied use than the Fourteenth Amendment.","The right to revolt has sources deep in our history.","Literature should not be suppressed merely because it offends the moral code of the censor.","We who have the final word can speak softly or angrily. We can seek to challenge and annoy, as we need not stay docile and quiet.","One who comes to the Court must come to adore, not to protest. That's the new gloss on the 1st Amendment.","It seemed to me that I had barely reached the Court when people were trying to get me off.","The right to be let alone is indeed the beginning of all freedoms.","The critical point is that the Constitution places the right of silence beyond the reach of government.","The Constitution is not neutral. It was designed to take the government off the backs of people."],"William Odom":["The whole notion of land property rights in the Arab world is different from that in Europe.","We need to go to the niceties of approaching the U. N. and let them have a chance to take it over, but we should set some sort of date and begin to move out and leave it to whoever takes over.","Once we destroyed the Saddam regime, we knew there was going to be a civil war.","Second, recent polls over there show that the majority of Iraqis want us to leave precipitously.","It was not in our interest to enter Iraq in the first place.","It was, however, in the interest of Osama bin Laden for us to destroy a secular Arab leader; it was very much in the interest of the Iranians because they wanted revenge against Saddam Hussein for Iraq's invasion in 1980.","Therefore, once U.S. forces leave, it is almost inevitable that an anti-Western, anti-U.S. regime will arise.","In fact, it struck me when we invaded last year that if we did it without European and East Asian support, we were risking losing our alliance in Europe in exchange for Iraq, and that is a very undesirable exchange.","But I would make it unambiguously clear that we are going to withdraw, and if Iraq falls into civil war and if all these unhappy things occur, we're just going to have to accept them.","So the idea that you could put Kurds, Shiite Arabs, and Sunni Arabs in a nice, liberal, federal system in Iraq in a short amount of time, six months or a year, boggles the mind.","While people out there on the spot certainly have to be held accountable for what they've done personally, the chain of command responsibility for this strikes me as just as important and should be dealt with.","I don't think that the war serves U.S. interests. I think Osama bin Laden's interests and the Iranian interests are very much served by it, and it's becoming a huge drain on our resources both material and political.","The presidents I served under don't have anything to do with my politics.","I have never belonged to a party. I don't have party affiliation.","Also, General Zinni, who commanded central command, was very much opposed to the war in the first place, as I was. We were both quoted to that effect in February of 2003.","I remember serving in Vietnam in that war, and many of us at the major Lieutenant Colonel, colonel level were frustrated that no one in the U.S. wanted to debate it that way.","In World War II in Germany, we had a ration for one U.S. soldier, or one allied soldier for every twenty inhabitants. The ratio in Iraq is about one for a hundred and sixty.","I will make a general statement that we have not had anything like the policy of holding people in high office responsible for their acts that I think we should.","Firing off 1,000 or 500 or 2,000 nuclear warheads on a few minutes' consideration has always struck me as an absurd way to go to war.","We've already seen proliferation. We started it with Britain, then France. Then we benignly let the Israelis do it. The Pakistanis and the Indians have recently done it. The Chinese have nuclear weapons.","Military officers from different countries, when they meet each other, tend to sort of fall in love, become mutual admiration societies, at the expense of realities.","To say that you now trust the Russian military command and control system because some Russian general told you from the bottom of his heart that's the case, strikes me as most unrealistic.","I've decided that the political context is such that the only way reform will finally come about in the Russian military is that the deterioration goes beyond the point to which these old generals can stand up there and resist it."],"William Osler":["The good physician treats the disease; the great physician treats the patient who has the disease.","Medicine is a science of uncertainty and an art of probability.","Variability is the law of life, and as no two faces are the same, so no two bodies are alike, and no two individuals react alike and behave alike under the abnormal conditions which we know as disease.","He who studies medicine without books sails an uncharted sea, but he who studies medicine without patients does not go to sea at all.","No bubble is so iridescent or floats longer than that blown by the successful teacher.","It is much more important to know what sort of a patient has a disease than what sort of a disease a patient has.","The best preparation for tomorrow is to do today's work superbly well.","Soap and water and common sense are the best disinfectants.","The philosophies of one age have become the absurdities of the next, and the foolishness of yesterday has become the wisdom of tomorrow.","To study the phenomena of disease without books is to sail an uncharted sea, while to study books without patients is not to go to sea at all.","Observe, record, tabulate, communicate. Use your five senses. Learn to see, learn to hear, learn to feel, learn to smell, and know that by practice alone you can become expert.","The greater the ignorance the greater the dogmatism.","The very first step towards success in any occupation is to become interested in it.","The value of experience is not in seeing much, but in seeing wisely.","We are here to add what we can to life, not to get what we can from life.","To have striven, to have made the effort, to have been true to certain ideals - this alone is worth the struggle.","There are, in truth, no specialties in medicine, since to know fully many of the most important diseases a man must be familiar with their manifestations in many organs.","What is the student but a lover courting a fickle mistress who ever eludes his grasp?","There is no disease more conducive to clinical humility than aneurysm of the aorta.","The natural man has only two primal passions, to get and to beget.","The future is today.","No human being is constituted to know the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth; and even the best of men must be content with fragments, with partial glimpses, never the full fruition.","The first duties of the physician is to educate the masses not to take medicine.","In seeking absolute truth we aim at the unattainable and must be content with broken portions.","Look wise, say nothing, and grunt. Speech was given to conceal thought.","The young physician starts life with 20 drugs for each disease, and the old physician ends life with one drug for 20 diseases.","One of the first duties of the physician is to educate the masses not to take medicine.","The teacher's life should have three periods, study until twenty-five, investigation until forty, profession until sixty, at which age I would have him retired on a double allowance.","It is much simpler to buy books than to read them and easier to read them than to absorb their contents.","There is no more difficult art to acquire than the art of observation, and for some men it is quite as difficult to record an observation in brief and plain language.","The desire to take medicine is perhaps the greatest feature which distinguishes man from animals."],"William P.

Leahy":["The more we can get together and talk about various perspectives, feelings, beliefs, the better.","One of the biggest issues that we face is that we have people who have their own particular concerns, whether it's on abortion, birth control, divorce and remarriage, civil rights or social justice.","This is a crisis, but there is an opportunity to help revitalize and renew the Catholic community.","As a university, we're not focused on bringing about huge reforms - that's not our role.","I would be with those who say the hierarchy in the United States has badly mishandled this whole situation.","I say let's respond as best we can to the victims and their families.","You know how the church has been hit so hard by the sexual misconduct by clergy, and what's that's done to Catholics, especially here in Boston but elsewhere as well.","The church may hold whatever it holds with regard to clerical celibacy.","What I think we can do is help individuals understand the church teaching, but also maybe help the church understand the viewpoint of lay men and women about what they want in regard to priests, or how do they want the hierarchy to deal with them?","We've always had issues up for discussion at Catholic universities.","Individuals will speak their minds, which I think is healthy.","I think the issue of clergy sexual abuse sparked people to look at their faith in a different way.","I would say the hierarchy has made terrible errors in judgment and it has to seek forgiveness by its members.","No organization, whether it's police or physicians or whatever, wants to have its errors held up to the light of day, but it's wrong, as is coming out so well.","Some of the speakers we bring on campus may not reflect official church teaching, but that's how it is.","By no means do I anticipate screening those who come on to campus... And I have no difficulty if a bishop across the country or some local pastor may say that's not Catholic teaching - that's fine.","The hierarchy shouldn't fear what we're doing.","What we're about is a manifestation of the Catholic roots of Boston College.","We are the meeting place, an entity that's trying to connect faith and culture.","BC is not going to replace the hierarchy, and BC is not going to lead some major reform in the Catholic Church - that's got to come out of the whole Catholic community.","Now where people are - at least the people I talk to - they are focused on issues of trust. Accountability also comes up, to make sure that this doesn't happen again.","Clearly there are individuals who don't understand what the church teaches, or they think it's so limiting.","Others don't want to listen to viewpoints that members of the church have.","I am very confident that the Spirit is with us.","The Spirit hasn't deserted the church today.","I think we can work through a lot of these issues."],"William P.

We need to focus on our work.","We knew all along we were making a good show, so its success was not a surprise to me. What has surprised me is the magnitude of this show's success. More people see me now in one episode than saw me in 20 years of movies and theater!","Grissom is pretty asexual. He's not that interested in anything other than work - except for Lady Heather. She's the closest to getting his heart of anyone.","Grissom comes from a place where we know he had a deaf mother, he was raised in a silent household, on some level, had a father who potentially was not around and he learned what he knew by himself in the back yard, with bugs and animals.

Good people and bad people, but lots of drama, and to get a chance to be genuinely silly is a great treat for me.","I think I spent my whole childhood diving out of haylofts with my BB gun and coming out shooting.","If I have a better idea, I say, 'Can we try one like this?' I try not to step on writers' toes, but ninety-nine percent of the time, it ends up in the movie, and sometimes it's the line that everyone remembers and quotes from the movie.","I enjoyed 'Roswell' a lot, and I had a lot of fun playing Jim Valenti. I had never done a show that lasted as long as that - that one lasted three years.","I think good acting is always character acting.","Maybe I don't take myself quite as seriously as I used to, but the work has gotten better and more interesting, and I'm just having more fun. It's getting more and more fun with each role.","As a director, it became important to hear that specific role read by that specific actor, and you hear the chemistry, or you don't hear the chemistry. So I'm not so bothered by the audition process anymore; in fact, I use it. It's a time for the actor to actually get to the know the director and the producers a little bit, too.","I love doing comedy, and I don't get a chance to much. I get to play lots of serious people and killers and people with a lot of... sheriffs."],"William Safire":["If you re-read your work, you can find on re-reading a great deal of repetition can be avoided by re-reading and editing.","Never assume the obvious is true.","Do not be taken in by 'insiderisms.' Fledgling columnists, eager to impress readers with their grasp of journalistic jargon, are drawn to such arcane spellings as 'lede.' Where they lede, do not follow.","Sometimes I know the meaning of a word but am tired of it and feel the need for an unfamiliar, especially precise or poetic term, perhaps one with a nuance that flatters my readership's exquisite sensitivity.","I welcome new words, or old words used in new ways, provided the result is more precision, added color or greater expressiveness.","What do you call a co-worker these days? Neither teammate nor confederate will do, and partner is too legalistic. The answer brought from academia to the political world by Henry Kissinger and now bandied in the boardroom is colleague. It has a nice upper-egalitarian feel, related to the good fellowship of collegial.","When I need to know the meaning of a word, I look it up in a dictionary.","When articulation is impossible, gesticulation comes to the rescue.","To be accused of 'channeling' is to be dismissed as a ventriloquist's live dummy, derogated at not having a mind of one's own.","The right to do something does not mean that doing it is right.","Last, but not least, avoid cliches like the plague.","Is sloppiness in speech caused by ignorance or apathy? I don't know and I don't care.","Have a definite opinion.","I think we all have a need to know what we do not need to know.","Knowing how things work is the basis for appreciation, and is thus a source of civilized delight.","I'm willing to zap conservatives when they do things that are not libertarian.","The wonderful thing about being a New York Times columnist is that it's like a Supreme Court appointment - they're stuck with you for a long time.","At a certain point, what people mean when they use a word becomes its meaning.","I'm a right-wing pundit and have been for many years.","One challenge to the arts in America is the need to make the arts, especially the classic masterpieces, accessible and relevant to today's audience.","Never look for the story in the 'lede.' Reporters are required to put what's happened up top, but the practiced pundit places a nugget of news, even a startling insight, halfway down the column, directed at the politiscenti. When pressed for time, the savvy reader starts there.","When infuriated by an outrageous column, do not be suckered into responding with an abusive e-mail. Pundits so targeted thumb through these red-faced electronic missives with delight, saying 'Hah! Got to 'em.'","Cast aside any column about two subjects. It means the pundit chickened out on the hard decision about what to write about that day.","Writers who used to show off their erudition no longer sing in the bare ruined choir of the media.","Previously known for its six syllables of sweetness and light, reconciliation has become the political fighting word of the year.","Stop worrying about the 'dumbing down' of our language by bloggers, tweeters, cableheads and MSM thumbsuckers engaged in a 'race to the bottom' of the page by little minds confined to little words.","A book should have an intellectual shape and a heft that comes with dealing with a primary subject.","A reader ought to be able to hold it and become familiar with its organized contents and make it a mind's manageable companion.","The noun phrase straw man, now used as a compound adjective as in 'straw-man device, technique or issue,' was popularized in American culture by 'The Wizard of Oz.'","Today, war of necessity is used by critics of military action to describe unavoidable response to an attack like that on Pearl Harbor that led to our prompt, official declaration of war, while they characterize as unwise wars of choice the wars in Korea, Vietnam and the current war in Iraq."],"William Samuel Johnson":["Hope is necessary in every condition. The miseries of poverty, sickness and captivity would, without this comfort, be insupportable.","Curiosity is, in great and generous minds, the first passion and the last.","Whatever enlarges hope will also exalt courage.","To improve the golden moment of opportunity, and catch the good that is within our reach, is the great art of life.","Hope is itself a species of happiness, and, perhaps, the chief happiness, which this world affords.","It seems to be the fate of man to seek all his consolations in futurity.","To keep your secret is wisdom; to expect others to keep it is folly.","Whatever you have, spend less.","He knows not his own strength who hath not met adversity."],"William Sanderson":["The only consistent hobby I've had is studying Spanish and French because of some delusion of grandeur to work around the world. I love sports but usually I'm looking for the next job.","I consider it probably one of the biggest honors to be in the Academy. There are only like 1300 actors in it, and as far as I know, you're a member for life. To this day, I'm wondering how lucky I was.","I'm not known for my intellectual range and tricks have been played on me.","One of the joys about acting is researching.","It's hard to watch something you've done many years ago.","I love the word 'resonance.'","I'm a journeyman actor, and I don't ever want to forget that. With romantic-lead dreams.","When I was in the Army, I read a book by Adlai Stevenson. He said law was as noble as saving a person's life. So at one point, I felt that way too.","I'm probably the most pessimistic actor I know. I'm always sure I'll never work again.","I've said maybe too many times that I'd rather be typecast than not cast at all.","Once I was in my last year of law school, I started doing plays, as I said, without taking the bar. And I got hooked. I did a play called 'Marat/Sade', and I never had so much fun in my life.","As a youngster, I had friends who became lawyers and doctors, and I was as idealistic as anybody. When I was in the Army, I read a book by Adlai Stevenson. He said law was as noble as saving a person's life. So at one point, I felt that way, too. But after a while, I said, 'Let me just finish the degree. I'm getting the G.I. Bill.'","One night I saw Jerry Lee, Johnny Cash, Carl Perkins, and Elvis for a dollar, if you believe that, in an open-air concert. Presley, I got to meet and go into his house and so forth. My wife says I should quit tellin' that story, 'cause they'll know how old I am.","It's easier to play quirky characters and hide behind wardrobe and make-up, especially.","I've been kinda fascinated by misfits, outcasts, and downtrodden people. I've identified with them. 'Blade Runner' probably got me more work than any. It convinced some producers that I could play something other than a rural crazy, I guess.","I kinda like where I am. If I'm recognized all the time, I have to leave better tips in restaurants.","My first western was 'Death Hunt' with Charles Bronson and Lee Marvin; that was where I learned to ride. The movie was based on a true story about a guy that eluded the Mounties in Canada. We were in Canada for six weeks riding horses.","In Montana, when we did 'Return to Lonesome Dove', we rode on the side of a hill at night in the dark; I was afraid my horse would step on one of the actors playing dead. The director said to leave it to the stunt doubles since they got paid for that.","I hope to outlive my enemies.","Someone once said that Sci Fi was the modern Western. What's my favorite? Well, anything that needs a misfit. I don't have a real favorite. My dream is to play something different.","'Newhart' ran the longest, and it was great to have a regular role, but I run into a lot of film fans, and they ask me about 'Blade Runner.' I was grateful to be a part of that.","When you play so many outcasts and derelicts, or even a murderer, you need to play someone healthy.","I like Edward G. Robinson - he started as a character actor and became a lead, which is probably why I like him.","The best came from my martial arts teacher, who also taught Elvis. He said, 'Your ego will get you killed.'","You can't go over every beat, every second, and worry about how you can do it better - it'll eat you alive."],"William Scott":["The one thing you've got to say about Columbia is that it has courses that are famous. It has alumni who come back and say it was the best thing they ever did.","On occasion I have drawn as a release from painting. The economy in using paper, pencil, charcoal and crayon can help towards a greater gamble and higher rewards. I also find that drawing can generate ideas more rapidly than painting.","Every painting I do is related to the last one: it may be a continuation of a previous painting or it may be a reaction against it.","There are certain authors that do not turn students on; it is the truth. Homer happens to be one of them.","The British system had requirements, including Latin. I'm not positive you ever had to know Greek, but there are certainly kinds of curricula where you had to know Greek too. I think in Britain there was the most mindless, repetitive sort of learning.","You just don't want to push people into doing things that they really don't want to do. I don't think it's going to produce much.","I feel constricted if I become too much aware of the act of making. Liberty is lost and instead of an instinctual lyrical expression the whole thing becomes arid.","I no longer worry whether a painting is about something or not. I am only concerned with the expectation, from a flat surface, of an illusion."],"William Scranton":["By Thursday morning, we'd gotten over the worst of it.","You're feeling the responsibility for hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people on your shoulder in a way that I couldn't feel as lieutenant governor.","And I remember walking in there and, I must say, I was quite unnerved the closer I got to it.","None of us are nuclear experts, but we know that if there is a melt-down and breach of containment, that's clearly the most odious thing that could happen.","The value of government to the people it serves is in direct relationship to the interest citizens themselves display in the affairs of state.","The first one, obviously, was walking into my office at eight o'clock in the morning on Wednesday, and being told there was a telephone call saying that there was an incident at Three Mile Island, and that it had shut down and that beyond that we didn't know.","Another very strong image from the first day was giving my initial press conference in the morning - going down and finding out that everything I had said, the essence of what I had said, was wrong.","What I had said in the morning was that this is what we know has happened, but there has been no significant off-site release. Only to find out moments later that, in fact, there had been an off-site release. I still haven't gotten over that.","There are allowable limits for radiation going - I mean there's radiation all around us. There's radiation from your television set. There's radiation from your computer. There's radiation actually occurring in the ground.","The Nuclear Regulatory Commission and EPA, et cetera, had worked out what allowable releases are.","And if you're not going to have a clear health threat, you don't want to panic people.","I was scheduled to give my first official press conference that morning anyway, 'cause I was chairman of the Governors Energy Council and I was making a press conference with regard to energy policy.","But the issue became, how long do you keep the press waiting so that you can gather more information?","And at ten, or whatever time, in the morning we had the press conference, what we knew is there had been an incident at Three Mile Island, that it was shut down, that there was water that had escaped but it was contained.","And it was at that point that I realized, in fact, our whole administration realized, that we could not rely on Metropolitan Edison for the kind of information we needed to make decisions.","There were schools and hospitals who were ready to take people with undescribed injuries, but not necessarily ready to take people with severe radiation poisoning.","Nobody could tell us or really had a very good idea, if there were a massive release of radiation, what kind of medical treatment people were going to need and this or that, or, indeed, whether there would be medical personnel around.","They're calling their Washington sources at the NRC or in Congress and they're not hesitating to give their opinion, but their opinion, frankly, in those early days was not very well informed.","You need a graphic understanding of a situation to make a complete judgment and we didn't have that.","None of us knew what this power plant looked like. We had no schematic drawing.","It took me 45 minutes to get in all of the suits and putting all the dosimeters on me so that they knew how much radiation I got and the protective boots and everything.","Obviously, I'm not looking in the core of the reactor, but I am looking at what, at that time, was considered the source of the trouble, which was the water and where it was.","When I started walking and I looked down and I saw on the floor this water, which looked like, you know, water in your basement except it happened to be in the auxiliary building of a nuclear power plant.","My time inside there was very short compared to the amount of time it took to take on and take off this suit and to test me for how much radioactivity I have.","All of the information that we were getting up to that time from the NRC people, from our people who knew something about nuclear power, was that the breach of the core was not a likelihood to happen."],"William Shakespeare":["Love all, trust a few, do wrong to none.","A fool thinks himself to be wise, but a wise man knows himself to be a fool.","It is not in the stars to hold our destiny but in ourselves.","We know what we are, but know not what we may be.","There is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so.","No legacy is so rich as honesty.","The course of true love never did run smooth.","Some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon them.","If music be the food of love, play on.","Hell is empty and all the devils are here.","It is a wise father that knows his own child.","Good night, good night!

I thought my life is over.","These people who come to Comic-Con and dress up - all across the country, the rest of the population who doesn't understand are scoffing at them.","My mother was an exuberant, silly lady.","You need to be silly to be funny.","You and I and everybody in show business and the entertainment industry fly by the seat of our pants. We don't know quite what is going to happen.","I am private.","Yeah, I do stand-up, my own type of stand-up.","The great mystery of our consciousness is beyond our grasp.","My name is William Shatner, and I am Canadian!","I love technology.","I've been breeding Dobies for years. Almost won the breed in Westminster at one time.","I've never been without a dog. I've made trips across the country with a dog.","I've been in that angst of loneliness, where you're really alone in the universe, except for the dog.","When you've done the technical part, you're then into the joy, the zen, into being. Technology no longer exists for you. You're then into the mystery of the thing you're doing.","I spent years doing 'Star Trek' bits and things, and a lot of people loved it, a lot of people mocked it.","I like making people laugh. It comes off and shines in everything I do.","Instead of playing something heavily, I play it lightly. Since people like to cast cyclically, once you've done one thing, people want to put you in that bag again. And since I want to work, I let it happen.","I think that prog rock is the science fiction of music. Science fiction speculates on what the future might be and look like and how we'll get there, and yet there's always a central theme of humanity, or there should be. Progressive rock has the same concept of exploration into the parts of the music world that hasn't been explored.","In entertainment, whether it's movies or television or whatever, I'm a great audience, but I don't remember the names of the people I've seen or the groups that I've heard.","I'm not technically adept at music, but I'd love to be part of a discussion of where progressive rock ends and country music begins.","I see myself as an actor with a love of music.","I love horses. There's something practical and mystical about them.","Over the years, I've become barraged by comments from people, such as, 'Beam me up, Scotty!' and I became defensive. I felt they were derisive and engendered an attitude. I am grateful for the success, but didn't want to be mocked.","I didn't realize that, in doing a documentary, there is this process of discovery. It's not like a film or a play with a set script. It sort of reveals itself.","Voice acting is very interesting, I've done several animated projects, and you have to make the voice reflect the character and try and do as much with a word as you can with a look in a live-action film.","Success is different for everyone; everybody defines it in their own way, and that's part of what we do in 'Close Up', finding what it was each person wanted to achieve and what their willingness to sacrifice for that was.","If someone criticizes my acting, they may be right.","My fear is dying badly, through illness or injury. But what a glorious demise it would be to burn up in space.","I love technology. Matches, to light a fire, is really high tech. The wheel is really one of the great inventions of all time. Other than that, I am an ignoramus about technology.","I am not a Starfleet commander, or T.J. Hooker. I don't live on Starship NCC-1701, or own a phaser. And I don't know anybody named Bones, Sulu, or Spock.","I was always working. Maybe you weren't aware of the movies I was making, or the television I was doing, or the shows I was creating, or the books I was writing; there have been thirty. But I have always been solidly at work, running as fast as I can.","The conundrum of free will and destiny has always kept me dangling.","I love to go to a movie, get a Diet Coke and a barrel of popcorn, and sit there with my kids and watch a film.","I don't watch television.","The problem is I don't know anything or anyone. I am so focused on the immediate picture in front of me.","I watch movies and sports. I can count on the fingers of my hand the number of times I have watched an hour show. I never watch a half-hour show, and I never watch myself."],"William Shawcross":["It is so basic as to be mundane, but in disaster relief, all the good will in the world can go to hell in a hand basket if the logistics don't work. In Ethiopia at the best of times, the logistics are difficult. It is a huge country - about the same size as Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma combined. It is also a transportation nightmare.","A few weeks before the jubilee began in 2002, Queen Elizabeth died, and the public outpouring of grief and affection, with hundreds of thousands of people queuing for hours to pass by her coffin, showed how widely and deeply loved she was.","Weapons of mass destruction are the greatest threat to life on earth. Biological weapons are often called the poor man's atomic bomb. Saddam Hussein is the ruler who has for decades been making the most determined and diabolical illegal effort to acquire them.","If trustees feel it is in their charity's interest to pay high salaries to attract talented people, then they should have the courage of their conviction and explain their decisions publicly.","Most Muslim charities are run by good people.","Writing or talking about famine and the world's response to it is not very easy.","Charities should not become the junior partner in the welfare state; whether or not they provide services funded by Government or, indeed, receive grants from Government, they must remain independent and focused on their mission."],"William Shenstone":["A liar begins with making falsehood appear like truth, and ends with making truth itself appear like falsehood.","Jealousy is the fear or apprehension of superiority: envy our uneasiness under it.","A miser grows rich by seeming poor; an extravagant man grows poor by seeming rich.","Zealous men are ever displaying to you the strength of their belief, while judicious men are showing you the grounds of it.","A fool and his words are soon parted.","The regard one shows economy, is like that we show an old aunt who is to leave us something at last.","Second thoughts oftentimes are the very worst of all thoughts.","The proper means of increasing the love we bear our native country is to reside some time in a foreign one.","Anger is a great force. If you control it, it can be transmuted into a power which can move the whole world.","The eye must be easy, before it can be pleased.","Virtues, like essences, lose their fragrance when exposed.","Poetry and consumption are the most flattering of diseases.","What leads to unhappiness, is making pleasure the chief aim.","A man has generally the good or ill qualities, which he attributes to mankind.","Every single instance of a friend's insincerity increases our dependence on the efficacy of money.","The world may be divided into people that read, people that write, people that think, and fox-hunters.","There is nothing more universally commended than a fine day; the reason is that people can commend it without envy.","His knowledge of books had in some degree diminished his knowledge of the world.","Every good poet includes a critic, but the reverse is not true.","Hope is a flatterer, but the most upright of all parasites; for she frequents the poor man's hut, as well as the palace of his superior.","Laws are generally found to be nets of such a texture, as the little creep through, the great break through, and the middle-sized are alone entangled in it.","The lines of poetry, the period of prose, and even the texts of Scripture most frequently recollected and quoted, are those which are felt to be preeminently musical.","Grandeur and beauty are so very opposite, that you often diminish the one as you increase the other. Variety is most akin to the latter, simplicity to the former.","The best time to frame an answer to the letters of a friend, is the moment you receive them. Then the warmth of friendship, and the intelligence received, most forcibly cooperate."],"William Shirley":["I am of opinion that it is highly requisite forthwith to pass a law, prohibiting upon great penalties all trade with our enemies, and more especially the supplying of them with arms, ammunition or provisions of any kind whatsoever.","I don't flatter myself with much dependence upon the present disposition of the Eastern Indians, who are many ways liable to be drawn into a rupture with us by the artifices of the French, their own weakness and the influence which the French Missionary Priests have over them.","Images adorn our inner life and carry great power there.","Images have a unique power to impart that which is beyond words.","My purpose is to inspire people of all walks of life to discover the virtue inherent within them and to bring forth that virtue in their daily lives.","Words alone cannot fully convey the realities of the soul or the greatness of the human spirit."],"William Shockley":["A basic truth that the history of the creation of the transistor reveals is that the foundations of transistor electronics were created by making errors and following hunches that failed to give what was expected.","An important fraction of United States industry adheres to the idea that research of a fundamental character is worthwhile from a practical point of view.","The objective of producing useful devices has strongly influenced the choice of the research projects with which I have been associated.","I was not allowed to take spherical trigonometry because I'd sprained my ankle. Because I'd sprained my ankle, I had an incomplete in gym, phys ed. And the rule was that if you had an incomplete in anything, you were not allowed to take an overload.","My decision to come to Bell Telephone Laboratories immediately after obtaining my Ph.D. in 1936 was strongly influenced by the fact that my supervisor would be C. J. Davisson.","Frequently, I have been asked if an experiment I have planned is pure or applied research; to me, it is more important to know if the experiment will yield new and probably enduring knowledge about nature."],"William Singe":["There are a lot of singers, but they weren't doing it the way I was, taking an Adele song and putting a hip hop beat behind it to make it a different song.","Deep down inside, I do feel, at times, that I have to prove to people that I'm actually an artist.","I will continue to work hard until I get to where I want to be.","I'd like to write about whatever is going on with me at that point of time or situations I'm - which I'm sure a lot of people can relate with. I mean, I'm a deep person. I'd like to dig deep into the psyche, but at the same time, you make things that are gonna lift everyone up.","I got tired of asking people to do stuff and waiting on results, so I just took it into my own hands.","I see a lot of Filipino fans supporting me, so I want to give back the love.","I was raised by my father, who was a singer, songwriter, guitarist, and bass player. His brothers all did the same thing, so I was kind of always raised around the music.","Even in school, I used to get kicked out in every class except music. I was always at the top of my class in music.","Songwriting was definitely first. I started singing, and then I was rapping; then I went back to singing. As I was growing up, I just taught myself piano and guitar.","I like to sing R&B slow jams. It's always been my thing.","'X Factor' did a lot for me, but things truly started to take off for me when I went to social media.","My career has been going better than expected, and I'm grateful.","I never started doing the videos because I thought they were going to get millions of views. I started doing them because I was at home, and I was bored.","No one's going to put in the effort you are for your career.","I'm trying to break away from doing covers or from being considered only as a YouTube star. I'm a singer, songwriter, sound engineer, and producer.","Some people would say, 'Nah, he's just a YouTube kid.' But I sing, play instruments; I can mix, master, and engineer - all those stuff.","I'm always open to collaborations.","You get butterflies when you see all the fans screaming.","I was so naive to think once you sign, it's all good, and you are a superstar.","A lot of artists are blind to how to use these crucial social media platforms - you don't have to put all your faith on other people; you can do it yourself.","Since I was about a little boy, I've always wanted to do music.","For everyone who hated, there are a hundred people who showed me love, and so, you know, I'm going to spend time showing them love than focusing on the negatives."],"William Sleator":["I can't write every day. I have to skip a day in between. If I try to do it every day, nothing comes.","I think about my audience when I write, to some extent. Thinking of writing for young adults, I try to keep the stories moving, never a dull moment, to hold their interest.","I've always been interested in both writing and music. When I first started getting published, I also worked as rehearsal pianist for the Boston Ballet, touring with them all over the U.S.A. and Europe - I wasn't making enough money from writing to support myself.","Stories develop from things I read and also from my own experiences and experiences of people I know."],"William Slim":["Moral courage is higher and a rarer virtue than physical courage.","There is only one principle of war and that's this. Hit the other fellow, as quickly as you can, as hard as you can, where it hurts him most, when he ain't lookin'.","When you cannot make up your mind which of two evenly balanced courses of action you should take - choose the bolder.","The dominant feeling of the battlefield is loneliness."],"William Sloane Coffin":["The cause of violence is not ignorance. It is self-interest. Only reverance can restrain violence - reverance for human life and the environment.","Hope arouses, as nothing else can arouse, a passion for the possible.","It's too bad that one has to conceive of sports as being the only arena where risks are, for all of life is risk exercise. That's the only way to live more freely, and more interestingly.","The world is too dangerous for anything but truth and too small for anything but love.","The woman most in need of liberation is the woman in every man and the man in every woman."],"William Stafford":["I have woven a parachute out of everything broken.","The more you let yourself be distracted from where you are going, the more you are the person that you are. It's not so much like getting lost as it is like getting found.","Kids: they dance before they learn there is anything that isn't music.","I'll be me, but I don't like it.","I just kept on doing what everyone starts out doing. The real question is, why did other people stop?","You don't need many words if you already know what you're talking about."],"William Standish Knowles":["At the time my dog had a fungus on her chest that wouldn't heal and resisted treatment. I made an ointment with our product and it cleared up in two days. She lived to 17 years.","I was born in Taunton, Massachusetts on June 1, 1917, but I actually grew up in nearby New Bedford.","My family background was heavily slanted toward business and seafaring matters.","I can't think of any relatives that ever went into science.","My family gave me the best in education.","To my father, business was the highest calling, but to my mother, medicine was the top profession.","I'll never forget the fall colors on the Berkshires.","In those days I was terrible at athletics and never made a team, but quite easily led my class in academics.","I was particularly good at math and science.","At this point I was strongly advised that I was too young socially to go to college so I took a second senior year at Andover, another boarding school.","At Harvard I majored in chemistry with a strong inclination toward math.","In those days industry would hire any chemist that could breathe.","Later in the fifties I got involved in kinetic studies using my long forgotten math background.","I was one who liked to work with my hands as well as my brain."],"William Steig":["I think I feel a little differently than other people do. For some reason I've never felt grown up.","To tell the truth, I don't read children's books. I'm an adult. I just write them.","People are no damned good.","I've always despised old people. I got angry at my father when he began to show signs of age."],"William Stephenson":["This is the wonderful thing about espionage, nothing exists any more.","We were trained to live by our wits, in any circumstance."],"William Stone":["Caves are whimsical things, and geology on a local scale is random and unpredictable.","Cave divers, of course, deal with an elevated level of risk, and the most that I can say here is that we tend to conduct our work at the bottom of a deep cave on an extremely conservative basis with heavy levels of backup equipment and a policy to abort if any single person doesn't like the situation underwater at any time during the mission.","Generally speaking, moving water is the most dangerous thing you can encounter underground.","Many people think all I do is some random engineering work in between caving expeditions. It's been far more deliberate than that.","There are plenty of people on Earth. It's not like the human race is going to disappear if a few people don't come back. Exploration is dangerous.","If you don't come home with data, you've done nothing."],"William Strunk, Jr.":["Vigorous writing is concise.","If you don't know how to pronounce a word, say it loud!","Vigorous writing is concise.

Avoid tame, colorless, hesitating, non-committal language."],"William Styron":["The good writing of any age has always been the product of someone's neurosis.","I get a fine warm feeling when I'm doing well, but that pleasure is pretty much negated by the pain of getting started each day. Let's face it, writing is hell.","Reading - the best state yet to keep absolute loneliness at bay.","Mysteriously and in ways that are totally remote from natural experience, the gray drizzle of horror induced by depression takes on the quality of physical pain.","Most books, like their authors, are born to die; of only a few books can it be said that death has no dominion over them; they live, and their influence lives forever.","A great book should leave you with many experiences, and slightly exhausted. You should live several lives while reading it.","If we do not find anything very pleasant, at least we shall find something new.","I think it's unfortunate to have critics for friends.","The writer's duty is to keep on writing.","Let's face it, writing is hell.","Writing is a fine therapy for people who are perpetually scared of nameless threats... for jittery people.","And so we came forth, and once again beheld the stars."],"William T. Vollmann":["The instant people specialize, it's in their interest to dehumanize the people their specialized function operates upon.","As I get older, I find myself getting angrier and angrier. Doubtless, change itself, not to mention physical decline and inevitable petty tragedies of disappointed expectations, would have made for resentment in any event; but I used to be a passive schoolboy, my negative impulses turned obediently inward.","A common measure of poverty is how much money you have in relation to other people - that is useful as far as it goes, but that excludes the case of, say, a hunter in the rainforest who has no money but is not poor. And there can be a number of people with money but who can consider themselves unwanted or invisible or estranged from society.","The first chance I had to go to Japan, which was in the early nineties, I went to a Noh play. I thought, 'This is very, very slow.' I noticed lots of people falling asleep. I didn't really know what was going on; I was getting a little sleepy myself. Then the more I studied it, the more fascinated I got.","Whenever we have an opportunity to engage with each other as human beings and to minimize the differences between us based on disparity in resources, then we should do it.","Whenever I travel to a poor country, I try to help at least one person. Usually, that person helps me just as much - I can find a local poor person to be my guide or my interpreter. That person makes money from me, I make money from him or her, we both learn about each other. It's an equal win-win relationship.","I don't believe in a personal god. It's good to give thanks, whether or not there's a god. There's no reason not to live life to the fullest. Morality is all the more important for people who don't expect to get a piece of celestial candy after they die.","If I didn't feel that I was doing something or trying to do something for others, then I would have very little excuse for the life that I lead.","When I was writing the first few books, what I would do is write a bunch of sentences and then go back and expand and explode those sentences, pack as much into them as I could, so they'd kind of be like popcorn kernels popping... all this stuff in there to make the writing dense, and beautiful for its density.","It's fun for me to try to write concise, compact things. It's a very good exercise for me. And I think it's important to try to do different things - change what I write about, and also the way I write. Otherwise, I'd just be repeating myself, which wouldn't be good for me or fair to my readers.","Once you've finished typing and moving text around and everything else, you have to leave it alone for a while. You do that to see if it stands up, to see if all the loose edges have been trimmed, if it makes sense, if it's consistent, what shape it really has. You can't tell that while you're working on it.","After college, I went to San Francisco and worked as a secretary in a reinsurance company. That was a pretty dismal job. It was a real small place. Guys would come in, and they'd sort of stick out their arms like wings so I could take their coats off. They'd tell me, 'Two,' and I'd put two lumps of sugar in their coffee.","Everybody is probably guilty of something. I'm sure that if anyone looked into my heart long enough, they could say, you know, 'Bill had some unkind thoughts back in second grade.'","Really what it gets down to is that my idea of the American life, the American dream, whatever, is that I can do what I wish in the privacy of my own home. And as long as I'm not hurting anyone, no one has a right to know what I do. The main thing that I have to hide is that I don't have anything to hide.","There's an Inuit myth about the origin of the human race. There were two brothers, and the younger brother eventually gets changed into a woman. And that's how humans reproduced. And I thought, 'How could I really understand that?'","Not only am I physically and emotionally attracted to women, I also wonder what being a woman would be like.","I think most of us who live into our 50s have had a few experiences with death. You know, we see people we know start to die. We realize it's getting closer and closer for us.","I go through all of my old notebooks, and I put an X on every page when everything has been entered into the computer, and sometimes that takes 15 years. But eventually the notebooks are full of X's, and they're no good to me anymore.","It's always, you know, a pleasant exercise to imagine my own death because then I'm so happy when I can stop.","At least for me, it takes more knowledge to write fiction than nonfiction. At least about someplace that I begin with a lot of ignorance about.","I think that we're all, as human beings, so limited. If we want to write about ourselves, that's fairly easy. And if we write about our friends or our families, we can do that. But if we want to project ourselves somewhere beyond our personal experience, we're going to fail unless we get that experience or we borrow it from others.","When I go train hopping and I look up into the sky, there are always so many more stars than I remember there were.","I first got really interested in Noh in about 1977. There was an independent bookstore in Bloomington, Indiana where I was going to high school. It was a really nice place. There was a New Directions paperback. It was the Pound/Fenollosa book, 'The Classic Noh Theatre of Japan.'","Precisely because I'm a man who is attracted to women, there may be some things that I have to say as a spectator of feminine grace that women themselves may not be able to see.","I might enjoy writing some ghost stories set in Japan because their whole idea about the spirit world is so interesting.","Don't write for money.","Everybody is an expert on one thing - that's what I learned in my high school journalism class - and that's, of course, his own life. And everybody deserves to live and have his story told. And if it doesn't seem like an interesting story, then that's the failure of the listener, or the journalist who retells it badly.","I've always felt I want to be of service to the world somehow. I haven't yet figured out how to do it, and I may never figure out how to do it.","I'm still a marginal figure living from book to book, but, as long as I'm producing labour as a good Marxist prole, I guess I'm satisfied.","I read and write for most of the day, but I do let myself be interrupted by real life. I enjoy going out with friends and try not to take myself too seriously.","I don't subscribe to organised religion. I've travelled enough to see that adherents of organised religion often attack adherents of other religions.","Kabuki is the way that I so often write; Noh is how I would write if I were more 'spiritual,' more understated, or perhaps just older.","My father grew up in an era when to be an American - a white American, at least - was to be yourself. In some respects, his generation was more ignorant, complacent, self-centered and parochial than mine.","So far, I've never missed a deadline for a term paper, a review, a manuscript. I perform the mumbo-jumbo of voting with belief in my heart, I've not yet won even a jaywalking ticket, and unlike my father, whom I fault in this respect, I refrain from opting out of jury duty; instead, they mostly kick me out.","My father hates organized religion, probably because he hates the God who killed his little girl back in 1968. I find religions variously bemusing.","Americans worry that Afghanistan has become a petri dish in which the germs of Islamic fanaticism are replicating - soon Afghans will be hijacking American planes and bombing embassies everywhere. And their fears are not necessarily unfounded. The Taliban are unemployed war veterans, ready and even eager to return to the battlefield.","'In the nineteenth century, we beat the British more than once,' Afghans often told me. 'In the twentieth century, we beat the Russians. In the twenty-first, if we have to, we'll beat the Americans!'","The case of Afghanistan vs. the Soviet Union is the clearest case of good against evil that I've seen in my lifetime. I thought it was terrific the way they got their country back.","I didn't vote for Bush, and I'm not happy particularly that he's president. But I will say I'm impressed that he didn't start bombing Afghanistan the day after Sept. 11. The more time that passes without him bombing Afghanistan, the more I respect him.","There have been times when I'm writing about things that are personally embarrassing. Like any human being, sometimes I can't help but wonder - 'What are the people I know going to think about this?' So I have to remind myself that all is permissible. Art has to be a free space. Language has to be a free space.","If I'm writing a book, and I'm warned, 'Oh, this is unsaleable, you need to make it shorter,' or, 'It has to be this, or that,' I'm proud to say I don't pay attention.","As large publishers turn into monopolies, and the MBAs who are running them - maybe editors used to run them before - are steadily tightening the screws, they feel more and more that they get to call the shots.","When I'm dying, I want to think I did what I felt was best for the words I was writing. This may mean, at any time, that I won't be publishable anymore.","So much of the destruction on Earth has been wrought by men. Women are the ones who give life and try to pick up the pieces... What a great gender they are."],"William Taylor":["We have found that morals are not, like bacon, to be cured by hanging; nor, like wine, to be improved by sea voyages; nor, like honey, to be preserved in cells.","Newlyweds, they have this ideal, this picture of what marriage is like, something similar of their favorite memories growing up. If only it were that simple."],"William Tecumseh Sherman":["War is cruelty. There is no use trying to reform it. The crueler it is, the sooner it will be over.","I am tired and sick of war. Its glory is all moonshine. It is only those who have neither fired a shot nor heard the shrieks and groans of the wounded who cry aloud for blood, for vengeance, for desolation. War is hell.","My aim, then, was to whip the rebels, to humble their pride, to follow them to their inmost recesses, and make them fear and dread us. Fear is the beginning of wisdom.","If I had my choice I would kill every reporter in the world, but I am sure we would be getting reports from Hell before breakfast.","Courage - a perfect sensibility of the measure of danger, and a mental willingness to endure it.","War is the remedy that our enemies have chosen, and I say let us give them all they want.","I intend to make Georgia howl.","This war differs from other wars, in this particular. We are not fighting armies but a hostile people, and must make old and young, rich and poor, feel the hard hand of war.","War is hell.","There is many a boy here today who looks on war as all glory, but, boys, it is all hell.","It is only those who have neither fired a shot nor heard the shrieks and groans of the wounded who cry aloud for blood, more vengeance, more desolation. War is hell.","I make up my opinions from facts and reasoning, and not to suit any body but myself. If people don't like my opinions, it makes little difference as I don't solicit their opinions or votes.","I hate newspapermen. They come into camp and pick up their camp rumors and print them as facts. I regard them as spies, which, in truth, they are.","There's many a boy here today who looks on war as all glory but it is all hell.","If nominated, I will not run; if elected, I will not serve.","Grant stood by me when I was crazy, and I stood by him when he was drunk, and now we stand by each other.","I would make this war as severe as possible, and show no symptoms of tiring till the South begs for mercy.","A battery of field artillery is worth a thousand muskets.","I think I understand what military fame is; to be killed on the field of battle and have your name misspelled in the newspapers.","I beg to present you as a Christmas gift the city of Savannah.","But, my dear sirs, when peace does come, you may call on me for any thing. Then will I share with you the last cracker, and watch with you to shield your homes and families against danger from every quarter.","If the people raise a great howl against my barbarity and cruelty, I will answer that war is war, and not popularity seeking.","In our Country... one class of men makes war and leaves another to fight it out.","Every attempt to make war easy and safe will result in humiliation and disaster.","There will soon come an armed contest between capital and labor. They will oppose each other, not with words and arguments, but with shot and shell, gun-powder and cannon. The better classes are tired of the insane howling of the lower strata and they mean to stop them.","You may as well say, 'That's a valiant flea that dare eat his breakfast on the lip of a lion.","My aim then was to whip the rebels, to humble their pride, to follow them to their inmost recesses, and make them fear and dread us.","You cannot qualify war in harsher terms than I will.","An Army is a collection of armed men obliged to obey one man.

It was a difficult war against an unorthodox enemy.","Without censorship, things can get terribly confused in the public mind.","When the soldiers came home from Vietnam, there were no parades, no celebrations.

With a country, vast in its extent, not utterly barbarous, but civilized in a very small degree? Does any one suppose a slave trade would help their civilization?","I would suggest that faith is everyone's business. The advance or decline of faith is so intimately connected to the welfare of a society that it should be of particular interest to a politician.","I am disturbed when I see the majority of so-called Christians having such little understanding of the real nature of the faith they profess.

There's nothing else to it.","Great pictures can't be entirely fictitious.","If Beethoven could write his 'Eroica Symphony' stone deaf, then William Wyler can do a musical.","There's only one prima donna in my pictures, and that's me!","A director must push his actors to the utmost limit to get everything possible out of each scene - without being corny or sentimental or going overboard.","The good ones push their luck to the limit - like Laurence Oliver. As actor and director, he will go just as far as he can.","Confusion seems to have become the vogue of European directors.","Everything a director does must help the story and the performances. Otherwise, it is useless.","Look at 'Marienbad' honestly. What is it? It is just another talking radio show with pictures. Nobody acts. People stand around while the author talks about the woodwork.","There is nothing clever about confusion.","When beautiful movie stars allow themselves to look terrible, people think they're really acting.","I'm accused constantly of having 'no signature.' That's the big artistic demerit. You can't tell a Wyler film from another man's film just by looking at it.","I made over forty Westerns. I used to lie awake nights trying to think up new ways of getting on and off a horse.","The trouble with Hollywood is that too many of the top people responsible for pictures are too comfortable and don't give a damn about what goes up on the screen so long as it gets by at the box office. How can you expect people with that kind of attitude to make the kind of great pictures that the world will want to see?","The slightest thing can ruin a scene, but you must be willing to take chances.","To me it's more fun and more challenging, too, to do different types of pictures."],"William Zabka":["Prior to 'The Karate Kid', I did commercials - Kool-Aid, Pepsi, milk - and I had always been cast as the all-American nice guy.","Sometimes you become a character, and sometimes the character becomes you.","My training in martial arts was kind of a crash course in how to look like a black belt. I know the moves of a black belt - my kicks, and my stretches, and my punches and all that.","You know, all 'The Karate Kid' fans from the original are parents these days. I think it's a cool thing.","I didn't set out to be a villain in film. I'm a character actor, and if my first movie was a comedy, I could have played a geek just as well.","Back when I was maybe 19, guys would go, 'I can kick your butt!' So I had a few showdowns. To my advantage, I learned martial arts, and what you really learn is not to fight.","Strangely, when I was a kid, my first acting job, at 5 years old, was a performance of 'The Three Little Pigs.' They cast me as the Big Bad Wolf."],"William of Occam":["It is vain to do with more what can be done with fewer.","Plurality should not be posited without necessity."],"Willie Aames":["No matter how I might feel about myself or my self-image, there is still a part of me that wants to fight to the end.","I never thought of myself as handsome.","Being stubborn can be a good thing. Being stubborn can be a bad thing. It just depends on how you use it.","I had older brothers and sisters who were high achievers, and I felt different, misunderstood by my family. That's not my family's fault; it was my perception.","My wife bought an extra life insurance policy on me.","Pray for your mate. Ask God to soften your heart and show you ways to be a better spouse.","I started running away when I was five years old. It wasn't until I was an adult that I realized what I really wanted was somebody to come after me when I was running away.","This is not what I would have chosen. But I have a heart to be obedient.","We produce programs that honor God and impact our world.","There are things God does for me daily, and it throws me into brain lock, because I know in my heart I don't deserve that kind of grace. I don't deserve that break.","God continues to work miracles in my life.","We're seeing how the videos translate to the live shows and how the technology is really reaching kids.","This is an exact replica of my chest.","God gives me the children's ministry heart and patience. This is what He wants. It's awesome. I don't know where He's gonna take it - but God is building this thing.","We've been called, and He has blessed.","I remember thinking, That's what I need - and that hope was in Jesus Christ.","When you're in that scene, you really wonder if this is all you're ever going to be. You know how vile and filthy you are inside.","I'm cleaning toilets for $30 a day, because I needed that $30, and people are pointing at me, saying, Look at the big movie star. Look where he is now. I just said, I'm where God put me.","I don't think you need to go looking for the enemy. He's going to look for you.","It's easy to be led astray when you're so broken. People take advantage of you.","I get scared to death when I see people who say they've found Jesus Christ, and they're out there, and I wonder, who's teaching them? Who's mentoring them?","I spent six years in Bible study because I needed to get grounded. People really need to spend time in the Bible getting to know the God they claim to love.","I realized there was very little in Hollywood I would ever feel comfortable doing. If I kept one foot there and one foot in my Christianity, I would never grow.","My pastor said, Just because you were a celebrity doesn't mean you're supposed to be a celebrity now.","I had never really pictured myself working in children's ministries. I always figured I would be more comfortable with maybe teens or adult ministries.","If there's comfort involved, it's probably not for me.","I want kids to understand that strength doesn't come from what goes on around you. It comes from inside you, and that comes from Jesus Christ.","I suppose what's unique about our presentation is the amount of Scripture that kids get.","I tell kids that people will let them down and people will hurt them. But Jesus Christ will never let them down and never hurt them.","We've both been married before and our previous experiences made us fearful of commitment.","They did interviews with my wife and daughter-they were genuinely in fear of me having a heart attack, working 20 hours a day, eating fast food.","This show has been a major revitalization of my family life and personal life. It gave my family an avenue to speak to me honestly.","I didn't become an actor because I wanted to act. Actually, I wanted to become a marine biologist. But most of all, I wanted to be accepted.","When you're a celebrity, people think they know you, but they don't have a clue.","I never thought I was particularly talented, and to be honest with you, I still don't.","I've always been pretty tough in that way, where if you tell me I can't do something, I will prove you wrong.","I think people who are artists, actors, singers, great songwriters, they tend to have a hyper state of emotion where they feel things very, very deeply, probably more deeply than the average person walking down the street where it may affect them, but not to the same extent.","I didn't want to be the typical teen idol. I didn't want to be Leif Garrett. I didn't want to be Shaun Cassidy, David Cassidy or Parker Stevenson. I wanted to do my own thing.","I lived to make Scott Baio laugh.","Nobody makes me laugh like my wife.","Everything can change. You can always have hope.","I think there are people that have very addictive personalities.","There is no other person on the face of this planet that I would rather sit and talk to than my wife.","Cruise director is - I always laugh and say, 'He's the ship's liver,' because almost everything you can think of filters through you at some point.","Being a teen idol or being a heartthrob on all the magazines, with Shaun Cassidy, Leif Garrett, and Scott Baio - it was embarrassing! I never understood it. I mean, why me? I never really got it.","I never dreamed I would want to be or become a financial advisor.","I think as Christians we have to sponsor a national Lighten-Up Day.","I always felt as though, 'If nothing else, I have a successful marriage.'","Since I was 9, I'd been told what to say, what to think.","I've watched a lot of my friends die, everyone from John Belushi, River Phoenix to Chris Farley. It just keeps going on and on.","I wanted to leave 'Eight Is Enough' for the Navy.","When I was growing up, I didn't know there was a world outside of California.","Hollywood has always been good to me. I've never blamed Hollywood for my problems.","I have a strong work ethic.","'Give up... it's time to quit,' I don't think I've ever really accepted those kinds of words in my life or vocabulary.","When you go through a traumatic event, there's a lot of shame that comes with that. A lot of loss of self-esteem. That can become debilitating.","There's a tendency for people to think that celebrities do whatever they want, spend whatever they want, and it's completely out of control. While some of that may be true, I've never met a celebrity who threw caution to the wind and thought they could do anything. That's not the thought process.","I never learned to study in studio school, so I had to teach myself to study.","I got married at a very young age, and of course, for all the wrong reasons, and ended up divorced and lost everything. It was a very difficult time in my life.","I think that in the Christian community, we're lacking a lot of things, and I don't know that it's just children's role models.","The Jews know who they are as a people. The Christians have not come together as a people yet.","When somebody comes to your front door, and they're screaming obscenities at you and telling you to come outside, and you've had your life threatened several times, you take it pretty seriously. It's the reason I have a Rottweiler."],"Willie Brown":["In politics, a lie unanswered becomes truth within 24 hours.","Mayors are judged by results."],"Willie Davis":["The road to success runs uphill.","If you step on people in this life, you're going to come back as a cockroach."],"Willie Dixon":["Birth is the sudden opening of a window, through which you look out upon a stupendous prospect. For what has happened? A miracle. You have exchanged nothing for the possibility of everything.","The Blues are the true facts of life expressed in words and song, inspiration, feeling, and understanding."],"Willie Garson":["Not everyone looks like Brad Pitt. There are people in the world that look like me. I think people feel that I could be living next door to them. That has much more effect on me.","'Sex and The City' had very strong gag orders as to what we could say and not say.","I am starting to explore directing, maybe in the future in the world of 'White Collar.'","TV deals in very broad strokes. Like, 'Oh, that's my dumb friend', or, 'That's my funny friend.' A true best friend, a sidekick, has to be a little deeper then that. You have to feel like there's nothing either character won't do. That someone really, really has their back."],"Willie Geist":["Like a lot of kids, I had a Superman cake or different theme cakes, but then I hit the age where I think my mom thought I was ready for the German chocolate cake that she makes for my dad. Just the sight of that, the taste of that frosting, just reminds me of being at home with my mom and my dad and my sister and my friends.","When you're young, the blue blazer feels like a grown-up costume.","Watching 'CSI: Miami' is like watching 'Teen Jeopardy!' or doing the crossword puzzle in 'People' magazine. It makes you feel smart even when you're not.","I'm pretty sure people are going to start writing letters again once the email fad passes.","You don't really have to say much when your headline is 'Drag Queen Robs Burger King.' Sometimes comedy writes itself.","If you're one of the fortunate few on this Earth with a pass to enter the gates of Augusta National on Masters Sunday, you don't leave early. You just don't. If it's a Masters Sunday when Tiger Woods is near the top of the leader board, you really don't leave early.","The great 'New York Times' columnist Dave Anderson famously slept one year in a child's race-car bed. There he was, Pulitzer Prize and all, snoring as his feet dangled over the rear tires of Lightning McQueen.","In a tradition second in wonderful absurdity only to 60-year-old baseball managers wearing uniforms and spikes in the dugout, golf spectators come dressed ready to play 18.","Kanye is going to have to decide early whether or not he's a Baby Bjorn guy, because the minute you put on that Baby Bjorn, there's no turning back. It's like buying a minivan. You lose a little piece of yourself when you get that Baby Bjorn.","Golf is the only sport where watching the game is arguably as grueling physically as playing it.","I can't say for sure where I was headed the first time my mom put a blue blazer on me. Church, probably. West Side Presbyterian in Ridgewood, New Jersey, specifically, where my blazer was paired with a clip-on tie and a pair of khakis for a Sunday morning with my fellow congregants.","Landing on 'Morning Joe' wasn't a fluke. I was a poli sci major in college. I interned at the CBS political unit, covered conventions.","I think President Obama has always been a little bit underestimated. Some of the things he's done with foreign policy have been unassailable. Getting us out of Iraq, killing Osama Bin Laden.","I think there's something about the homemade birthday cake, because my wife, on my daughter's first birthday, started the tradition where she takes a full cake and cuts the number birthday out of it.","I'm 6-foot-4. If my life depended on it, I could still dunk a basketball. Then I would need assistance from a first responder to get down from the rim.","I often eat Skippy's Super Chunk peanut butter out of the jar with a spoon. I don't shamefully sneak it in the dark of night when everyone is in bed. I just twist that cap off and go to town right out in the open.","An ideal day starts with putting on a good, smart, fun show where I learn something and ends with me fending off atomic knee drops from my two kids in our no-holds-barred pillow fight/steel cage matches. They are a ruthless tag team.","My routine is to ride that snooze button as far as it will take me, take a quick shower, get dressed in the dark and bolt out the door.","When you live in New York City, you run up a long list of things you've been meaning to do.","High on the list of things I've been meaning to do since I moved to New York in 2004 is going up to a Columbia University football game.","I keep my politics a little closer to me than others do.","It doesn't matter if you're famous or infamous. All that matters is you're a celebrity.","I have a simple plan to solve the economic crisis. Give every American a $100 credit to the dog track of their choice. I have found the puppies to be a reliable source of income with a consistent rate of return.","The nice thing about 'Morning Joe' is that I do get to do serious news sometimes.","Contrary to conventional wisdom, the blue blazer's a bit of a loose cannon. A suit decided long ago what it wanted to be, and it doesn't want to hear your ideas, but a blue blazer only got around to half the job. So it leaves it up to you to find its bottoms. Gray slacks, blue jeans, patterns, white pants and different blue shades all work.","Chris Rock is a very funny man.","When you work in TV long enough, you tend to get a little jaded with different things you have to deal with.","I hate to make this point too often, but imagine for a moment George W. Bush were on his sixth vacation, and he was asked about Iraq, and he said 'I'm buying shrimp.' You think that wouldn't be a headline everywhere?","Bachelor parties would pay a lot of money to hire Pat Buchanan to come.","I've had two pedicures in my life, and they were glorious.","If the relentless personal maintenance plan has taken over your life, give it a rest.","I'm not a coffee drinker, so my drink is kind of like a girlie skim chai latte. I'm not proud of it, but it's really good.","There's a lot to be said for going to baseball games for a living.","I am one of the five best parallel parkers in the United States of America. Dead serious. It's to the point now where I look back when pulling into the spot only as a formality.","I guess it turns out choosing your life partner from a group of men trying to get their break in show business by sitting around shirtless in a swimming pool while cameras watch around the clock isn't the path to a soulmate after all.","I got into television in 1998 when I didn't have a computer or even an email address.","People know the facts of a story just as well as the people on TV do, and they have more platforms to hold the media accountable when they don't get it right. We are a world full of media experts. That's a great thing.","Everyone worries about their kids, of course, but you can drive yourself nuts thinking about all the horrible things in the world - and many, many people do. I believe life is to be lived and not survived.","It's fun to deliver material on live TV because it's more off-the-cuff, but I like writing better. You really can measure the joke, think an extra second and nail the right reference.","The thing about me is that I don't judge my audience. I welcome. It is a big tent.","Do whatever you want to do in the privacy of your own home.","My dad was always fascinated and amused by Trump, so I learned to be fascinated and amused by Trump.","My daughter will be reading about Pat Buchanan in a history book someday, and I am hanging out fist-bumping with him and joking with him.","I don't think anybody's quite accurately branded me. I'm not sure I could do it myself.","In our deepest places, we all wish we could live like Raoul Duke for a while.","Unintentional comedy is comedy just the same.","I don't know that I 'look up' to them, but in our predictably partisan media world, I admire journalists who are genuinely nonpartisan and totally fearless in their work - people who have no interest in being invited to the cocktail party. I don't agree with everything he writes, but Glenn Greenwald comes to mind.","I was a big Dave Winfield guy growing up.","I was a landscaper for three years and loved it.","My dad is so unique in what he does. It's not like I'm taking a torch from him and doing his thing. I hope I've carried from him a little bit of a sense of irony, a little bit of a wink.","I do remember vividly sometime after puberty when I'd answer the phone at home and the callers began to say, 'Hi, Bill!' That's when I knew Dad and I had the same voice."],"Willie Green":["We have only God on our side; they have 'In God We Trust' on their side.","I feel more comfortable with the ball in my hands, playing the point guard. But I like playing the 2, too. I think I bring tough defense and the ability to score and also get my teammates the ball to score.","Thanks to all the fans from Detroit and Philly who are recognizing what type of player I am, and I hope they keep supporting the Sixers."],"Willie Herenton":["If the news isn't there, don't create it. If I look at local news, I don't know what's real.","My primary motivation for running for the 9th Congressional District is that I strongly believe that one of the hallmarks of the American democracy is a representative form of democracy."],"Willie Keeler":["I keep my eyes clear and I hit 'em where they ain't.","Learn what pitch you can hit good; then wait for that pitch."],"Willie Mays":["In order to excel, you must be completely dedicated to your chosen sport. You must also be prepared to work hard and be willing to accept constructive criticism. Without one-hundred percent dedication, you won't be able to do this.","Robinson was important to all blacks. To make it into the majors and to take all the name calling, he had to be something special. He had to take all this for years, not just for Jackie Robinson, but for the nation.","When I'm not hitting, I don't hit nobody. But, when I'm hitting, I hit anybody.","They throw the ball, I hit it. They hit the ball, I catch it.","In 1950, when the Giants signed me, they gave me $15,000. I bought a 1950 Mercury. I couldn't drive, but I had it in the parking lot there, and everybody that could drive would drive the car. So it was like a community thing.","Baseball is a game, yes. It is also a business. But what is most truly is is disguised combat. For all its gentility, its almost leisurely pace, baseball is violence under wraps.","I was very fortunate to play sports. All the anger in me went out. I had to do what I had to do. If you stay angry all the time, then you really don't have a good life.","At ten I was playing against 18-year-old guys. At 15 I was playing professional ball with the Birmingham Black Barons, so I really came very quickly in all sports.","I would try and help everybody, because the game was so easy for me. It was just like walking in the park.","I was a baseball player, I taught baseball, and all of a sudden I was in the business world. Now I used the baseball world to talk about their product. Not too much, just enough to keep going. Just be yourself and you'll never have a problem. That's what I did.","And my father didn't have money for me to go to college. And at that particular time they didn't have black quarterbacks, and I don't think I could have made it in basketball, because I was only 5' 11\". So I just picked baseball.","I didn't say I was that smart, I said I went to class and I enjoyed what I was doing.","Every time I look at my pocketbook, I see Jackie Robinson.","Defense to me is the key to playing baseball.","That's how easy baseball was for me. I'm not trying to brag or anything, but I had the knowledge before I became a professional baseball player to do all these things and know what each guy would hit.","I played with the Birmingham Black Barons. I was making 500 at 14. That was a lot of money in those days.","I think I was the best baseball player I ever saw.","When I got to professional ball I used to play 150 games every year. It depends on how many games there was.","People talk about that catch and, I've said this many times, that I've made better catches than that many times in regular season. But of course in my time, you didn't have a lot of television during the regular season. A lot of people didn't see me do a lot of things.","Yes, I had to learn how to live life outside, but I had so many people help me.","I don't compare 'em, I just catch 'em.","If you can do that - if you run, hit, run the bases, hit with power, field, throw and do all other things that are part of the game - then you're a good ballplayer.","It's not hard. When I'm not hitting, I don't hit nobody. But when I'm hitting, I hit anybody.","I don't mean to be bashful, but I was.","When I was in Birmingham I used to go to a place called Redwood Field. I used to get there for a two o'clock game. Where can you make this kind of money playing sports? It was just a pleasure to go out and enjoy myself and get paid for it.","I was very blessed with a good body. Never got hurt. Never was in the hospital. The only time I was in the hospital was when I would get exhausted a little bit, and go in for a check-up or something.","I think I was programmed to do good things when I came into the majors. I knew how to play.","The greatest challenge I think is adjusting to not playing baseball. The reason for that is I had to come out of baseball and come into the business world, not being a college graduate, not being educated to come into the business world the way I should have.","I'm a very lucky guy. I had so many people help me over the years that I never had many problems. If I had a problem, I could sit down with someone and they would explain the problem to me, and the problem become like a baseball game.","I always enjoyed playing ball, and it didn't matter to me whether I played with white kids or black. I never understood why an issue was made of who I played with, and I never felt comfortable, when I grew up, telling other people how to act.","Maybe I was born to play ball. Maybe I truly was."],"Willie McCovey":["I've always had a connection here in the city from the first day I arrived. I stayed in the city. I made San Francisco my home. I was seen in the offseason at a lot of different functions, and people liked that.","I loved coming up with players in scoring position and I had to drive them in.","I could run like a gazelle, couldn't I?","I had pain in both knees my whole career. Not many athletes play pain-free. Mine was just more than normal.","I was doing what I love to do: play baseball. Not going to complain about that.","Ballplayers, like everyone else, like to get told they did something right.","Winning is a serious matter.","Even during my career, when I read all those great things about me, it's almost like I was reading about someone else. It's almost like there was another person.","In my first year, when I was driving in runs, winning games and making headlines, there was an old man who came to games at Seals Stadium, and one day he called me over, introduced himself and told me not to believe anything written about me or think too much of all the accolades.","I had talked for years about doing a restaurant with Rocky Dudum, who's been my friend since I first came to San Francisco. Then Rocky's son, Jeff, said he wanted to design it, so he traveled around the country to sports restaurants like Mickey Mantle's and Michael Jordan's, and he came up with a great concept.","It doesn't seem like it's been 50 years. I don't even feel like I'm 50 years old yet, though I've had all these knee and back operations.","I enjoyed hitting in the Major Leagues more than in the Minor Leagues. I didn't want to tell anybody it was easier, because I didn't want to sound cocky. But Major League pitchers had better control, and most of them were around the plate."],"Willie Morris":["His claim to his home is deep, but there are too many ghosts. He must absorb without being absorbed.","When a writer knows home in his heart, his heart must remain subtly apart from it."],"Willie Nelson":["Once you replace negative thoughts with positive ones, you'll start having positive results.","When I started counting my blessings, my whole life turned around.","I believe that all roads lead to the same place - and that is wherever all roads lead to.","Cruelty is all out of ignorance. If you knew what was in store for you, you wouldn't hurt anybody, because whatever you do comes back much more forceful than you send it out.","I used to work in the cotton fields a lot when I was young. There were a lot of African Americans working out there. A lot of Mexicans - the blacks and the whites and the Mexicans, all out there singing, and it was like an opera in the cotton fields, and I can still hear it in the music that I write and play today.","We create our own unhappiness. The purpose of suffering is to help us understand we are the ones who cause it.","I am not a pig farmer. The pigs had a great time, but I didn't make any money.","I think people need to be educated to the fact that marijuana is not a drug. Marijuana is an herb and a flower. God put it here. If He put it here and He wants it to grow, what gives the government the right to say that God is wrong?","You know why divorces are so expensive? They're worth it.","A lot of country music is sad. I think most art comes out of poverty and hard times. It applies to music. Three chords and the truth - that's what a country song is. There is a lot of heartache in the world.","I been a long time leaving but I'm going to be a long time gone.","Don't try to change anybody. And they should let you be yourself, 'You loved me when you met me, so let's keep going!'","Freedom is control in your own life. I have more control now than in the past, and I'm learning the value of saying no. That's very important.","My doctor tells me I should start slowing it down - but there are more old drunks than there are old doctors so let's all have another round.","You don't have to be poor to need something or somebody.","Freedom is control in your own life.","I think most art comes out of poverty and hard times.","When you're singing, you're using extra muscles, and it requires a lot of exercise and breathing. You can't do that if you're a sissy. If I have any fitness advice for people, I'd tell them to sing more. It's good therapy, too.","I didn't come here and I ain't leavin'.","I was influenced a lot by those around me - there was a lot of singing that went on in the cotton fields.","There's a great enthusiasm for good country music all over the world.","I grew up across the street from, you know, the Villarias, which was a great Mexican family there. In fact, there was three houses right across the street from me. So, day and night, I listened to Mexican music, and I'm sure, you know, my guitar playing, singing, writing, whatever, has a lot of Mexican flavor there, but it comes natural.","I'm not prejudiced in any way that I can think of. That's just not the guy I am.","If you really want to get along with somebody, let them be themselves.","I'm from Texas, and one of the reasons I like Texas is because there's no one in control.","Three chords and the truth - that's what a country song is.","Ninety-nine percent of the world's lovers are not with their first choice. That's what makes the jukebox play.","It doesn't hurt to feel sad from time to time.","If you got the money honey I got the time and when you run out of money honey I run out of time.","Great songs stand out wherever they're from.","When you hear me, you know it's me, regardless of the song.","You want to be a good parent and you want to be a friend, and it's hard to be both. You have to balance it as well as you can.","We're still here trying to get the word out that 330 farmers are quitting every week.","I don't think any person has any special knowledge about what God has planned for me and you any more than me and you do.","I think Ray Charles did as much as anybody when he did his country music album. Ray Charles broke down borders and showed the similarities between country music and R&B.","I guess if you can't sing, you better have a style!","Anybody can be unhappy. We can all be hurt. You don't have to be poor to need something or somebody. Rednecks, hippies, misfits - we're all the same. Gay or straight? So what? It doesn't matter to me. We have to be concerned about other people, regardless.","We've already been reincarnated about a million times, maybe. It doesn't make sense any other way.","If a song was ever good, it's still good.","I think most people realize that our problems are our government, not me and you individually, except that we can - must have some sort of responsibility, because they're in there and they were elected, so we have to defend ourselves on those lines.","I don't like to think too far ahead.","America, to me, is freedom.","I wanted to connect all people who are thinking about peace on Earth.","I started out really young, when I was four, five, six, writing poems, before I could play an instrument. I was writing about things when I was eight or 10 years old that I hadn't lived long enough to experience. That's why I also believe in reincarnation, that we were put here with ideas to pass around.","As long as there's a few farmers out there, we'll keep fighting for them.","Everything about Sinatra was good. He had the ability to pick great songs, and once Sinatra had sung them, that pretty much was it. He pretty much put his stamp on everything.","I would like to see more airplay for all artists, no matter what age. I think there's a lot of money being spent toward the young guys, but a lot of the older guys are the ones who blazed the trail for those young guys.","When I'm driving the highway by myself is when I write best.","I was born in Abbott, Texas, a little small town in central Texas, and I was raised by my grandparents. And my parents divorced when I was six months old, and my grandparents raised me.","I like myself better when I'm writing regularly.","What has changed is that nothing has changed... that's what has made me more unhappy than everything else.","I got along without you before I met you and I'll get along without you a long time after you're gone.","I just enjoy both working and not working.","I like to play small clubs.","I just enjoy both working and not working. And fortunately, I work enough where I get that out of my system, and then we take a few days off, take a rest.","I started out writing poems before I figured to put melodies to them and play the guitar. Somewhere, there's a book out there on all those early songs and poems. I hope no one ever finds it. I don't think it's my finest work.","You could make any song sound creepy if you wanted. It's all about the inflection.","I text and email my friends and family a lot, but that's about the extent of my high-tech-etude.","Since I was a kid, music was what I wanted to do. I thought I could make it by my own talents. That's what I wanted to prove.","Most of the stuff I've read about me has been true.","All I do is play music and golf - which one do you want me to give up?","I think I'm basically the same guy I always was. Maybe I've learned, through experience, to rein in some of the anger and temper they say redheads normally have.","I never gave up on country music because I knew what I was doing was not that bad.","The whole house came up and I came up with it... I was just praying to the Lord to take care of me.","There are only so many notes so there must be only so many melodies.","Sometimes there is a 36-piece orchestra going off in my stomach.","Well the country songs themselves are three-chord stories, ballads which are mostly sad. If you are already feeling sorry for yourself when you listen to them they will take you to an even sadder place.","But if you think of all the people who don't like me, just think of all the millions who've never heard of me!","Where I grew up, Bob Wills and his western swing was very popular. And western swing is not that far from jazz and blues.","And as far as guitars go, I loved Jimmy Bryant and Speedy West's stuff.","I'm a romantic slob!","The first time I got onstage was when I was about 5 years old. It was at a church social, and I had a poem to recite.","Waylon Jennings and I had a lot of fun recording together.","Writing books is fun because after I do a show for a couple hours, I'm in a bus for 22 hours. It's not hard for me to look out the window and tell a joke here and there.","When I see someone I think is cool, he's a pretty well-adjusted individual. He's not too affected one way or the other by what's happening, no matter what's going through his mind.","I like to stick with music I know I can play. I love classical, but I don't think I could ever play it. I'm just not qualified.","All my kids were raised on computers: They were home-schooled on the Internet, so they're pretty good at that stuff. And I'm proud of them, but I don't really keep up with it.","When I was about 12, I had my first paying gig - 8 dollars to play rhythm guitar in a polka band. Pretty soon, I ended up playing in all the bars within driving distance of Abbott, Texas."],"Willie Robertson":["You don't set off in life to be mediocre. At least, I don't.","I cut a rap song once. It was a few years ago for my old show 'Buck Commander,' and it was a song called 'You're Short.' It was about my camera guy. We shot the video in Las Vegas, 'Ocean's Eleven' style!","The original purpose of the beards was to help with the wind when it's blowing in your face. When you're out there in the woods hunting like we are all the time, we found that facial hair helps you to stay a lot warmer.","Sometimes in the heart of the summer, I look at people with their faces shaved and think it'd be nice, but once you get used to it, it's not as hot. Most guys say it gets itchy, but once you grow it out into a big man beard, the itching is gone.","I would recommend getting married young. That way you don't have all the baggage.","Making duck calls is the hardest thing that we make, so there's skill involved, and they're all handmade.","We've been in business together ever since we were children, so back in the day, there were so many references to 'your dad.' Rather than wanting to sound totally hickified and go, 'Well, my daddy said,' we would refer to him as 'Phil.'","I think Dad didn't really treat us like children; he treated us more like little adults. We were good kids.","I think my father had a lot of anti-establishment in him. He came through the '60s.","Phil has the classic, mature beard. Jase's is kind of red - it's weird, like him! Jep grooms his the most: He's got all these special lotions and perfumes that he puts on.","Si's beard is really awkward. One side is longer than the other, and it's about three different colors. I don't think he washes it. It's nasty."],"Willie Smits":["I must stress, basically, the very fact that we do have orangutan rehabilitation means that we have failed to do what is really important, and that is rescue the wild orangutan in its habitat.","Orangutan babies are like human babies: helpless.","Orangutans look straight into your soul."],"Willie Stargell":["There's nothing I value more than the closeness of friends and family, a smile as I pass someone on the street.","I'm proud of the fact that I'm the only player to hit a ball completely out of Dodger Stadium.","Human beings are pampered by the Lord. Their real tests don't come until later in life.","To me, baseball has always been a reflection of life. Like life, it adjusts. It survives everything.","Life is one big transition.","I would always reserve a special place in my heart for Pittsburgh.","I found myself in a race with Mother Nature to play as much baseball as I could before she forced me to stop.","A World Series trophy is a wonderful thing to behold.","I've witnessed thousands of superior athletes try to becomes hitters and fail at it.","You only have a few years to play this game and you can't play it if you're all tied up in knots.","I'm always amazed when a pitcher becomes angry at a hitter for hitting a home run off him. When I strike out, I don't get angry at the pitcher, I get angry at myself. I would think that if a pitcher threw up a home run ball, he should be angry at himself.","The bat is gone, but the smile remains.","Oakland revolved around Forbes Field. Nothing in the city could match that atmosphere.","To be successful, one must take chances.","Vietnam helped me realize who the true heroes really are in this world. It's not the home-run hitters.","Playing baseball was my dream, and no amount of money could sway my opinion.","Love soothes wounds, while hatred and violence deepen them.","It's supposed to be fun, the man says 'Play Ball' not 'Work Ball' you know.","I love September, especially when we're in it.","People like us are afraid to leave ball. What else is there to do? When baseball has been your whole life, you can't think about a future without it, so you hang on as long as you can.","They give you a round bat and they throw you a round ball and they tell you to hit it square.","I loved to hit with men on base and with the game on the line.","Simple pleasures were all the pleasures that I knew as a child.","Never had I had so many friends and so much fun as I did in the projects.","That's where the future lies, in the youth of today.","I owe a large part of my success to Joe Brown, who helped me both as a player and a person.","Judgment traps you within the limitations of your comparisons. It inhibits freedom.","I eventually became proud of my strikeouts, because each one represented another learning experience.","Baseball for me was instinctive, born within me, given to me as a gift from God.","I flailed my arm in a throwing motion before I could even walk.","Unfortunately, inner feelings and potential are often stunted by our parents, relatives or peers.","I've always been a slave to my heart.","I was the most powerful left-handed hitter in the Alameda area.","Helping someone is what life is all about.","The Giants were a good team, but our biggest enemy was said to be Candlestick Park.","I gave out stars whenever an appropriate situation presented itself.","I don't really feel that I deserve all my applause.","My first job after my retirement from baseball was as a narrator for the Eastman Philharmonica.","I always said that when it was time to retire, I would know it, and I would just tip my hat to the crowds.","We all wore a 21 patch that one season as a silent tribute to our deceased teammate Roberto.","Never was I booed.","We devote our entire lives to becoming good ball players. We take batting practice until our hands bleed.","Reporters often forget that athletes are human beings.","When we make a mistake, it becomes front-page news. We don't need any reporter telling us how badly we played.","If a reporter doesn't like the person he's writing about, it shows up in his article.","I never did allow anything to keep me from my kids. They're the most important part of my life.","I'm a God-fearing man who worships with my heart and with my life.","I never search for a reason why - I have faith in the Lord's purpose.","I see a lot of people who love their jobs. I see some garbage collectors smiling as they go about their work.","I was bred as an outcast, part Negro and part Seminole, in my early years raised as an Indian.","To middle-class parents, the project team may have seemed unfit for children, but it was exactly what I needed.","I was always a self-proclaimed poor slider.","I wasn't out drinking and abusing my body. I simply loved to go out and dance."],"Willie Wells":["One of the main reasons I came back to Mexico is because I've found freedom and democracy here, something I never found in the United States.","I was branded a Negro in the States and had to act accordingly. They wouldn't even give me a chance in the big leagues because I was a Negro, yet they accepted every other nationality under the sun.","Ignorance is pitiful! If you are ignorant and stupid, you are sick - white, black, green, I don't care."],"Willis Polk":["Before I was 20, I was the leading architect of the Southwest.","No age is compelled to take its beauty from preceding epochs.","To form our taste, we must neither depreciate nor imitate, but we should understand and originate.","Remember that a noble logical diagram, once recorded, will never die; long after we are gone, it will be a living thing, asserting itself with ever-growing insistency.","In city planning, there is no limit to be fixed."],"Willow Bay":["For women of my generation, it was the 'juggling act.' Jobs, marriage, children, homes, and aging parents were the balls we added, tossing them in the air as our lives filled up and praying they wouldn't come crashing down on our heads.","New forms of media - first movies, then television, talk radio and now the Internet - tend to challenge traditional codes of conduct. They flout convention, shake up the status quo and sometimes provoke outrage.","The 'science' behind hormone replacement therapy has put women on a medically engineered, press-fueled, big pharma funded roller coaster ride.","Social activism has gone mainstream. A new generation of philanthropic leaders such as Bill and Melinda Gates, and Bono are providing inspiration, guidance, and billions of dollars through their global foundations.","I know it's very 'old media' of me to admit this, but I am often unnerved by the lack of civility on the Web.","With a click of the 'Post Comment' button, Netizens can quickly bring down the level of dialogue. Bloggers lob zingers, commenters trade barbs, and bullies target kids in the cyber schoolyard. Mudslinging - a time-honored political tradition - thrives on the Web.","On the Web no subject is sacrosanct. No one, from icon to unknown, is off-limits."],"Willow Shields":["I find it not hard to make friends, but it's definitely different when I go somewhere like summer camp and everyone already knows that I'm in 'Hunger Games'... My life is still pretty normal, and I still have some really great friends.","My brother said 'I want to start acting,' and me and my sister just said, 'Oh we'll try it, we'll see.' It was just one of those things - we were just like, 'Oh, we'll see what happens.'","For 'The Haunting Hour,' I thought it would be a lot of fun. It was great to play this cool kid role. My episode is called 'The Intruders' and my character is this mean, angry teenager because her younger brother was just born and he gets all of the attention. She's always playing tricks on her family, and there are some cool twists.","It's not a struggle, but sometimes when you're gone for a month or two, you start to miss your friends. I love acting so much that it fills that gap of being sad about not being able to see my friends.","My brother was a huge fan of 'The Hunger Games' for a couple of years before I got the role, so he was really excited when he heard that I got the role.","Two of my favorite actresses are Meryl Streep and Angelina Jolie. So, I would love, love, love to work with them. But I also really love AnnaSofia Robb. There are a lot of great actresses I would love to work with.","Well, my life hasn't really changed... I've been homeschooled for a long time. So that helped a lot because of shooting and stuff. But, I have had friends who I've been friends with for years and years and they are my true friends, you know?","I didn't audition for the part! The role was offered to me, and I was so excited to be a part of 'The Haunting Hour.' It is such a cool show and it was so much fun shooting the 'Intruders.'","'Poltergeist' terrifies me! When the little girl Carol Anne is talking to the TV, I get shivers every time.","I have mostly been terrified of listening to scary stories around a campfire. We camp a lot as a family, and at night my dad would try and tell us scary stories. This made eating s'mores difficult. The story would start with something like... 'and the old man who lived in these woods...' I would then run back into the camper terrified.","I'm not really allowed to drink a lot of caffeine, because I'm 11.","I thought it was really funny that half the people I autographed things for said, 'Autograph the back of my phone.' I was like, 'What? Really? Seriously?' They didn't have anything else.","I have a home-school group with a couple of my friends. We switch off going to each others' houses and going to the library to do art and stuff. It's almost like our own little school - a really little school.","I really want to try to become a great actress when I get older and continue to do what I'm doing now.","I definitely look up to Meryl Streep because she's been in so many amazing movies, and I just think that she's one of the greatest actresses out there. I also look up to Jennifer Lawrence, especially knowing her and knowing that she is so awesome and so nice.","I have three dogs, a cat, fish. I'm a huge animal lover. They're amazing.","I know with Gary Ross especially, he kind of gave me pointers here and there, but he kind of let me become firm in any way that I needed, and he just let me try things and to explore what I can do with my acting. So that was very helpful.","I'm interested in a lot. Like right now, I'm just really excited for 'Catching Fire' and 'Mockingjay' Part 1 and 2. But I love playing characters like Prim - I mean, Prim is like my dream character - but after 'The Hunger Games', it would be fun to look and see what else I could do well. But right now, Prim is like my dream role.","It's weird because I've grown up a lot after filming the first 'Hunger Games' movie. Growing up with a character is really interesting because you feel like you have this connection with the role.","It's been crazy. My life has totally changed. One week I was in school, hanging out with my friends and the next, I'm going to the L.A. premiere of one of the year's biggest movies. It's been a crazy experience."],"Willow Smith":["If you don't like me, if you like me; both are equally cool. I send love and positive energy to all those people in their lives. I hope they find where they're meant to be.","I have the motto that says, 'Whatever you see in your closet that you like, pick it and wear it.' It's not just your closet, but just your life. Whatever catches your eye. Pick it.","I wear anything I feel like. If I want to put on a pair of Converse with a pencil stuck through them, I will.","I feel like I'm making a difference. I feel like putting out a message for young girls to follow your dreams and just work at what you want to do and be yourself.","Whipping your hair means not being afraid to be yourself.","If I know what's true in my heart and my soul, then what people say can't shape that.","I never really get to go to school because I am always on tour or with my father. There is a tutor most of the time, but usually I am working so I never get to do the lessons. The worst thing about maths is all the kids are ahead of me because they go to school.","I like eating pepperoni. I heat it up in the microwave and then I let it roast and then I eat it with cheese.","If I had to change one thing about my life, it would probably be, I wouldn't be famous. Because when you're famous it's so hard.","If you're not really having fun then there's no point of really trying.","If I want to put on a pair of Converse with a pencil stuck through them, I will.","I get my flow from Daddy, my singing ability from Mommy, the camera stuff from both. That's just what happens when you hang out with the Smiths.","Famous-ness is awesomeness... but some parts of famous-ness can be hard.","If you don't work hard, then you aren't going to have the success that you want. But if you work hard and dig in, then you are going to have the success that you want.","I like to eat cheese out of a bowl everyday.","I can never tell what I'm gonna wear. I kind of just put on whatever feels right. Sometimes that's Converse and a T-shirt, sometimes it's Givenchy heels and leather pants.","I like the way Billy Idol sings. Mommy turned me on to him.","I have everything that I would possibly imagine. I have a family that loves me and that's... more than most kids have. And it's really awesome for me to experience this life... because most kids don't have this life, and I'm trying to reach out to them and help them.","When I first got into the entertainment industry, I would always watch Rihanna and all those people, so I was like, 'Ooh, I have to be this.' So my mom was like, 'Just be yourself.'","My style kinda comes from the music I listen to.","I'm not really sick of people whipping their hair. It doesn't really get old. They're fans and I love them! It's just a fun game to play."],"Willy Bogner, Jr.":["I always try to be a universalist, not a specialist.","I adjust my priorities according to the most important project I'm involved in at the time.","If we admit it or not, skiing is a little bit of show biz.","We have been around in the States in the ski wear market since the 1950s, but now we feel we can compete in the sportswear field.","Our clothes are expensive. I guess you could say we are aiming at the Yuppie market. But we feel America is moving away from quantity to the desire for quality. That is what we offer.","When you introduce something new to a country, you want to do it right. Generally, that means you have to do it yourself.","Quality has always been the overriding factor for us. But you also have to have happy people working for you."],"Willy Brandt":["It often takes more courage to change one's opinion than to keep it."],"Willy Ley":["Ideas, like large rivers, never have just one source.","The study of an idea is, of necessity, the story of many things.","Just as the water of a river near its mouth, in its final form, is composed largely of many tributaries, so an idea, in its final form, is composed largely of later additions.","No one can deny that Russia fired some big rockets and placed satellites into orbit. But there's been a deluge of poppycock about 'miraculous' scientific advances that enabled them to do it. Much of this analysis reflects ignorance about rocketry.","It is practically certain that sometime during 1958, either the Russians or we, and most likely both, are going to shoot a rocket to the moon.","The dark areas, the 'mare' plains of the moon, are so incredibly smooth that the English astronomer Thomas Gold has suggested that they might really be depressions filled to the brim with dust. A rocket hit would show whether they are that or not."],"Wilma Mankiller":["The secret of our success is that we never, never give up.","There are a whole lot of historical factors that have played a part in our being where we are today, and I think that to even to begin to understand our contemporary issues and contemporary problems, you have to understand a little bit about that history.","In Iroquois society, leaders are encouraged to remember seven generations in the past and consider seven generations in the future when making decisions that affect the people.","I don't think anybody anywhere can talk about the future of their people or of an organization without talking about education. Whoever controls the education of our children controls our future.","Prior to my election, young Cherokee girls would never have thought that they might grow up and become chief.","A lot of young girls have looked to their career paths and have said they'd like to be chief. There's been a change in the limits people see.","I've run into more discrimination as a woman than as an Indian.","We must trust our own thinking. Trust where we're going. And get the job done.","I want to be remembered as the person who helped us restore faith in ourselves.","Everybody is sitting around saying, 'Well, jeez, we need somebody to solve this problem of bias.' That somebody is us. We all have to try to figure out a better way to get along.","Growth is a painful process.","Individually and collectively, Cherokee people possess an extraordinary ability to face down adversity and continue moving forward.","America would be a better place if leaders would do more long-term thinking."],"Wilma Rudolph":["When the sun is shining I can do anything; no mountain is too high, no trouble too difficult to overcome.","Winning is great, sure, but if you are really going to do something in life, the secret is learning how to lose. Nobody goes undefeated all the time. If you can pick up after a crushing defeat, and go on to win again, you are going to be a champion someday.","Never underestimate the power of dreams and the influence of the human spirit. We are all the same in this notion: The potential for greatness lives within each of us.","When I ran, I felt like a butterfly that was free.","I loved the feeling of freedom in running, the fresh air, the feeling that the only person I'm competing with is me.","I ran and ran and ran every day, and I acquired this sense of determination, this sense of spirit that I would never, never give up, no matter what else happened.","It doesn't matter what you're trying to accomplish. It's all a matter of discipline. I was determined to discover what life held for me beyond the inner-city streets.","Believe me, the reward is not so great without the struggle.","No matter what accomplishments you make, somebody helps you.","The triumph can't be had without the struggle.","My doctor told me I would never walk again. My mother told me I would. I believed my mother.","After the scarlet fever and the whooping cough, I remember I started to get mad about it all... I went through the stage of asking myself, 'Wilma, what is this existence all about? Is it about being sick all the time? It can't be.' So I started getting angry about things, fighting back in a new way with a vengeance.","I believe in me more than anything in this world.","I was six years old before I realized that there was something wrong with me... But I did have this crooked left leg, and my left foot was turned inward.","No one has a life where everything that happened was good. I think the thing that made life good for me is that I never looked back. I've always been positive, no matter what happened.","Down South, there was the old 'ladies-don't-do-such-things' way of thinking. You couldn't be a lady and a good athlete at the same time.","I don't know why I run so fast. I just run.","They would say, 'If you run around too much as a girl, you'll never be able to have children.' The running was supposed to be too much strain for your body, and your body would never be the same again.","Sometimes it takes years to really grasp what has happened to your life.","Later on in life, I discovered that in order for me to be successful, I had to have a challenge. I can't do a nine to five job.","But when you come from a large, wonderful family, there's always a way to achieve your goals.","I have spent a lifetime trying to share what it has meant to be a woman first in the world of sports so that other young women have a chance to reach their dreams.","The feeling of accomplishment welled up inside of me, three Olympic gold medals. I knew that was something nobody could ever take away from me, ever.","In college, I was an education major and qualified for several jobs. But the fame that came with the Olympic medals was too threatening to many people.","You become world famous, and you sit with kings and queens, and then your first job is just a job. You can't go back to living the way you did before because you've been taken out of one setting and shown the other. That becomes a struggle and makes you struggle.","There were good jobs, but they were never what I wanted to do. Somehow, people always thought of Wilma Rudolph as a threat."],"Wilmer Valderrama":["The sex with Mandy was good, but it wasn't like warm apple pie.","Mandy because that was the most meaningful relationship.","I play opposite Beverly D'Angelo, and that was definitely a great time.","I got hit twice in the face, and that was not fun.","Honestly, I've been very blessed. Yes, I am cursed with this gift.","As an actor, you should be willing to take challenges.","When I first came to this country, I didn't know how to speak English.","Because I had an accent, people had this impression that I was dumb."],"Wilson Bethel":["I collect records pretty assiduously, so I've got, like, a massive record collection. I still DJ.","It's almost a joke how good I am at charades. Not to pat my own back, but I'm literally - I'm kind of unstoppable.","I've been having these dinner parties at my house in L.A. for years that turn into charades parties. I'm so good at breaking stuff down into syllables and sounds. If I were to be doing anything else besides being an actor, I would be a professional charades player. I'm not sure if it exists, but if it didn't, I'll create it.","I do like all different kinds of sports and stuff.

We build ours all differently.","Rocket scientists agree that we have about reached the limit of our ability to travel in space using chemical rockets. To achieve anything near the speed of light we will need a new energy source and a new propellant. Nuclear fission is not an option.","Nearly all of our existing power sources are generators which use a heat cycle. This includes our coal, oil, and gas fired utilities, our automobiles, trucks, and trains, and even our nuclear fission utility power plants.","Nuclear fusion of light elements like hydrogen or helium would permit approaching the speed of light. It seems very attractive to refuel your space ships where the fuel is.","We have never succeeded in slowing down our nuclear fusion reactors.","The 20th Century was the century of Aviation and the century of Globalization.

That's why you have a radiator in your car in the first place.","There is more He-3 energy on the Moon than we have ever had in the form of fossil fuels on Earth. All we have to do is to go there and get it.","I have long felt that an investment by the Department of Energy of a million dollars a year for the next 30 years would pay a higher return than any other investment this country could ever make.","History has repeatedly shown that when a new method or material becomes available, new uses for it arise.","This is no job for a UN committee. It needs the same kind of unwavering dedication and the kinds of people that got us the first nuclear submarine and the first man on the moon.","We need the kind of leadership exemplified by President Kennedy to just do it! But we must do it as good stewards, aggressively exerting control over the moon. We can best do this by going there.","It is clear that the nation that assumes stewardship of the Moon now will inherit stewardship of the galaxy in the coming millennium.

Do not look at small advantages. Desire to have things done quickly prevents their being done thoroughly. Looking at small advantages prevents great affairs from being accomplished.","In the battle of existence, Talent is the punch; Tact is the clever footwork.","All anger is not sinful, because some degree of it, and on some occasions, is inevitable. But it becomes sinful and contradicts the rule of Scripture when it is conceived upon slight and inadequate provocation, and when it continues long.","Failure has gone to his head.","To my embarrassment I was born in bed with a lady.","I respect faith, but doubt is what gives you an education.","Art is science made clear.","A slave has but one master.

They had to do more than just give up open shots. They had to avoid fouls and pass me the ball in traffic.","When you go out there and do the things you're supposed to do, people view you as selfish.","I guarantee you, if you could give me 10 points in all those seventh games against the Boston Celtics, instead of Bill Russell having 11 rings, I could've at least had nine or eight.","If you have ability in a certain area, why not capitalize on it and improve it and use it?","I get constant reminders from fans who equate that game and my career as one and the same.","It just wasn't right the way they were behind by 25 points and then they're told to hold the ball.","It was a challenge to my teammates to help me.","They were willing to do anything to stop me.","I couldn't have come close without my teammates' help because the Knicks didn't want me to make 100.","But the point of using the number was to show that sex was a great part of my life as basketball was a great part of my life. That's the reason why I was single.","We're all fascinated by the numbers, as we were about the 100 points.","You must understand as a kid of color in those days, the Harlem Globetrotters were like being movie stars.","And I remember leaving my place in L.A. and - my father is a big fight fan - and I said, 'Dad, I got a couple of days off and I'm getting ready to go to Houston to sign to fight Muhammad Ali."],"Wim Wenders":["The more opinions you have, the less you see.","Film is a very, very powerful medium. It can either confirm the idea that things are wonderful the way they are, or it can reinforce the conception that things can be changed.","Any film that supports the idea that things can be changed is a great film in my eyes.","Many of the critics today get airline tickets, hotel accommodation, bags, beautiful photographs, gifts and other expenses paid by the distributors, and then are supposed to write serious articles about the movie.","The Cuban people have an amazingly strong and unbroken spirit.","Maybe it's the music that enables them to function like that, to always take everything as it comes and never complain about the misery, hardship or injustice.","Cinema is a worldwide phenomenon.","So I am getting a little bored with defining one type of film as American and the other European or from somewhere else because the division is no longer true.","It's very hard to find critics or a magazine today that will publish material that is genuinely independent and written without any concern about being cut off some distributor's list or not be invited or flown into screenings.","The culture of independent film criticism has totally gone down the drain and this seems to come with the territory of the consumer age that we are now living in.","Entertainment today constantly emphasises the message that things are wonderful the way they are. But there is another kind of cinema, which says that change is possible and necessary and it's up to you.","Take opera for example - to go to the opera you have to dress up in a tuxedo and pay lots of money.","For us music is mainly part of the entertainment world and is often a luxury.","Ibrahim tells his story without a grain of complaint, and this was true for all of the band members. This is very much part of the Cuban spirit and soul.","I've never been anywhere in my life like it and I only really noticed it when I returned to Los Angeles and then Berlin. Everybody is much better off in these places, there is not poverty like in Cuba, but everybody complains about things.","I'm getting a little bored by the juxtaposition of American and other cinema. I no longer think this division is as true as it might have been in the 1980s, or the early part of the 90s.","What is generally referred to as American-style films are, in fact, studio productions.","For years all I seemed to be doing was lobbying politicians and others to persuade them that European culture needed movies, and that we had to protect it.","But I think that the spirit of protectionism would be the grave of European cinema. You cannot protect something by building a fence around it and thinking that this will help it survive.","Movies are something people see all over the world because there is a certain need for it.","In fact, it is amazing how much European films - Italian, French, German and English - have recovered a certain territory of the audience in their countries over the last few years.","In the late 1980s the amount of German films was down to four or five percent of the market, and the remaining 95 percent were American. It is now 20 to 30 percent German productions.","Of course the French are making very credible movies and it is still one of the greatest nations in terms of world cinema but the real problem is the decay in film criticism.","In this age of consumerism film criticism all over the world - in America first but also in Europe - has become something that caters for the movie industry instead of being a counterbalance.","Many French directors, having now realised there was no more real criticism, that the standards of the past have gone, are very offended about the quality of film criticism.","Filmmakers and critics wrote about each other and sometimes very harshly. This no longer exists.","Everything is entertainment; criticism is now entertainment and it seems that the French directors have woken up one day and suddenly realised that they were not backed up any more.","On the contrary a film can promote the idea of change without any political message whatsoever but in its form and language can tell people that they can change their lives and contribute to progressive changes in the world.","Any movie that has that spirit and says things can be changed is worth making.","Neither Rainer Werner, nor any of us could have succeeded, or produced the number of films that we did, just on our own. We showed our films to each other, discussed them vigorously and rarely agreed.","Butte was once a grand city. To me, that city is like one big stage for Edward Hopper. You could put your camera anywhere, and you felt you were looking at his paintings."],"Win Butler":["I love my iPhone; it's great to have a camera around all the time.","I'm not someone who can dance to a song I don't like.","It's a lot easier to sabotage your career than to have a career to sabotage.","I was really sick of bands just ignoring the audience as a posture in rock music. And I think we fed off each other in terms of trying to engage the audience, not in a hammy way, but actually trying to be aware of the space that you are playing in and trying to connect in some way through the music.","A lot of people get really stuck in this idea that everything's been done and there's nowhere left to go.","Usually, I think you have most of your musical influences locked down by the time you're 16.","The film 'Black Orpheus' is one of my favorite films of all time, which is set in Carnival in Brazil.","I feel like I'm kind of a bit of a sponge in a way. Like, if people around me are going through things, I find it very hard not to be empathetic.","I studied the Bible and philosophy in college, and I think in a certain sense that's the kind of stuff that still makes my brain work.","The cliched rock life never seemed that cool to me.","Our music may sound big emotionally, but that's more to do with the playing, the level of musicianship and the full-on energy. Often, the lyrics are often quite small and focused.","I had a somewhat religious upbringing. Not strict, but it was there, and I'm kind of thankful for that. If you grow up just watching MTV, that's its own form of religion, and it's not even based on happiness or communal responsibility. I mean, try to construct a worldview out of that.","I'm not practising, I don't go to church, but what I got from it was a sense of belonging to something bigger. What I really miss is being forced to be in a community with people that aren't the same as you. Then, you really have to work through the ways that you're different.","Funny songs aren't usually that good. Like Weird Al and maybe a couple of Beatles songs, but it's kind of hard to bring humor into rock music in an interesting way.","I think there's some pretty amazing language in the Bible.","Whenever you're talking about meaning, basically... I think a lot of the human experience has to do with trying to understand what things mean, and there's not really any tools to do that unless you're thinking about it in a more spiritual or philosophical realm.","I found out a lot of stuff through MTV, and I didn't even have cable, I just saw it at friends' houses. But my culture in junior high was totally influenced by it.","I never really felt super-Texan. It wasn't like I was unhappy, but I wasn't superhappy.","The idea of peer critique, of talking about each other's art - I just found it so useless.","The idea of dancing to bad house music is something I could never get behind.","I'm not a good hipster - if I let my moustache grow for weeks, it just looks like I have dirt on my face. I'll never have a glorious handlebar moustache.","I don't like to talk about other bands in interviews.","I grew up in a somewhat religious family. My dad's family isn't religious at all, but my mom's side of the family is, so I was exposed to church a bit.","If you think about it, if you've ever been to a Catholic service, it's practically a laser light show. It's very dramatic, very theatrical. The outfits they wear, it's all designed to be impressive.","We're exposed to ideas everywhere. The world is full of ideas. I think that television is a pretty powerful medium in that regard.","My parents live near the ocean, and I've spent a lot of time walking through the water at night, being around the water.","The work that Partners in Health do in Haiti benefits the whole world.","The music in Haiti is all tied up in voodoo and African rhythm, and so there's this funny thing: go to a voodoo ceremony, and then go to a Catholic church and tell me which music you liked better, to which one the music is more integral.","Everyone has their own talents. It's up to the individual to see what you can actually do.","When I was living in Boston, I worked in this store that played the college radio station. I had to listen to it all day, and I didn't care for most of it.","It seems like the record industry made so much crazy money in the 1960s that everyone wanted to get in on it. Now it's just become very corporate. So all of these people who despise music end up being in charge.","The Flaming Lips have been on Warner Bros. forever, and certainly everything I heard growing up was on a major label in some way, from the Cure to Radiohead to Bjork.","My favorite English teacher in high school showed me 'Brazil' when I was 15, and it blew my mind. It's one of those movies that's revealed itself in different ways as I've gone back to it over the years.","Being in a rock band, I feel a certain responsibility to have a weird haircut. I mean, who else gets to do that?","There are so many bands that I'm kind of aware of through media about them, and it ends up filtering my experience of the actual music."],"Winfield Scott Hancock":["Colonel, I do not care to die, but I pray to God I may never leave this field.","My politics are of a practical kind - the integrity of the country, the supremacy of the Federal government, an honorable peace, or none at all."],"Winfried Vahland":["One cannot compare Skoda with the Volkswagen brand. Volkswagen is the world's biggest brand selling over four million cars a year, so there is really nothing to compare.","I believe there are segments in the Indian market that Skoda will not enter.","In China, people are moving from bigger cars to small hatches, and interestingly, the Indian market is graduating to bigger cars and sedans. I will say that we will not put money only in just one segment.","I believe that we have not yet played out full competitiveness in the notchback segment.","Investment will lead to employment; employment means better income; it means selling more cars.","I promise to myself I will make cars that work and functions worldwide.","To make a very specific car only for India - where you don't know where the segments are tomorrow or will it shift - is tough.","When Octavia was introduced in India in 2001, it had opened up new segments."],"Winifred Holtby":["The crown of life is neither happiness nor annihilation; it is understanding.","The things that one most wants to do are the things that are probably most worth doing.","What a strange distance there is between ill people and well ones.","These are they whose youth was violently severed by war and death; a word on the telephone, a scribbled line on paper, and their future ceased. They have built up their lives again, but their safety is not absolute, their fortress not impregnable."],"Wink Martindale":["I have loved hosting over the years, simply because I love working with people. It's the perfect job.","You go to work, tape five shows in one day and then go home and play golf for the rest of the week and then start the week all over. I thought if something like that came along, I'd love to do that.","And then I did one called High Rollers and that was a lot of fun.","I figure anything over 13 weeks in this business is pretty good.","When you look at Regis, he really and truly does feel for those people, and I feel like I've done it too. You're giving away somebody else's money so what do you care? It's not your money.","So after being with somebody for any number of days like that, you can't help but feel for them. You can't help them, but you certainly can root for them.","Regis has a great rapport with the American public.","I've often talked about that, and I've been asked that a couple of times and my feeling are that if you have a good show, a bad host will not even hurt the show.","I love doing what I do.","The people at home don't care what your problems are. They just know that you're doing that show and you're supposed to do the best you can do. It's not a 9-5 type of job.

They must also have a connection with the people who work for them and be able to mobilise their best energies to create teams where people can be most creative and happy.","I grew up in a country that was in a civil conflict for most of my childhood and adolescence. I saw violence and lived as a teenager through the time of a brutal dictator called Idi Amin. I fled and became a refugee.","Rule of law, access to justice, and financial transparency happen by design, not accident.","Civil society space provides the oxygen for citizens to participate and meaningfully hold their governments and the private sector to account - and ensure that decisions are made in the interest of the majority and not the few. Without it, citizens have limited space to dissent and challenge the elites.","When men and women, boys and girls, are denied the right to education, the right to own land, the access to basic services like healthcare and clean water, a fair price for the crops they grow, a fair wage for the work they do, or the right to be part of making decisions that affect them, the result is poverty.","Economic inequality is a corrosive force that undermines economic growth, puts a brake on the fight against poverty, and sparks social unrest.","Conflict and callous politics drive famine.","Inequality, climate change, and conflict are evicting millions from their homes. But these perils are being met with 'anti-answers' such as nationalism, closed borders, lies, and hatred.","The high price of medicines is crippling healthcare systems and denying people access to the treatments they so desperately need.","We need to harness the boundless energy and creativity of our youth.","Our economic system has enabled companies and individuals to use their power and influence to capture and retain an ever-increasing share of the benefits of economic growth while the benefits for the poorest in society have shrunk.","When we talk about women's economic empowerment, we should be careful that we're not just giving women more to do.","The discrimination of women and girls goes to the core of any and all analyses of the world's economic, political, and environmental problems.","Ending extreme poverty is possible.","Wealth does not trickle down to the poor. Oxfam knows this, the IMF knows this, the World Bank knows this. Poor people have always known this.","I am angry that the international community has failed to find a permanent solution to the plight of the Rohingya. I am also ashamed that, in not speaking out loudly enough, we - humanitarians - have been complicit.","Whatever I do, it will be fighting for social justice.","The struggles to overturn colonial rule were long and often bitter. But, over time, most were inevitably successful.","Poverty is rooted in injustice.","Women, men, and children have fundamental rights to humanitarian assistance and protection. Yet far too many states block aid and attack their own citizens, and too many others - including some of the world's wealthiest countries - turn their back on those fleeing conflict and violence.","A tax system is important because of what it can pay for, but also for how it works. When we pay taxes, we expect something back from the state; it strengthens the relationship and accountability between us and our governments. It also pays for what private finance shouldn't: our needs for healthcare, education and social security.","Oxfam is part of a global movement for social justice. We mainly work to fight for economic and social rights for people without a voice or people who are oppressed.","I don't think it's helpful to go dismantling the past, but you can refuse to honor aspects of it that you don't believe in anymore.","Leadership is so defined by men, and we need to revise that - we need to be able to say that the people we honor are not the conquerors but the peacemakers.","Extreme inequality is no temporary blip. It is hard-wired into our economies.","By allowing super wealthy corporations and individuals to avoid paying their fair share of tax, tax havens are denying governments' revenue that could and should be spent on schools, healthcare, and other essential services.","Cutting down a forest for timber adds to GDP, but what we don't record is the loss to our wealth in terms of natural resources.","We treat a planet at crisis point as an externality that can be shunted into a future generation. We continue to act as if we had the natural resources of several planets, not one.","GDP excludes care work and other unpaid work, most of which falls to women and girls in rich and in poor countries alike.","Tax abuse is a scourge on our global community, but especially for Africa.","African countries lose the most from tax dodging. African governments must, therefore, do more to push for a full reform of the global tax system and demand action from countries, such as the U.K., whose financial centres sit at the heart of the global network of tax havens.","For me, growing up as an activist under an oppressive dictatorship in Uganda, the U.N. was a friend to those of us who fought our way to freedom, as it was for the millions who joined decolonization struggles in the African continent.","Without women's equal access to positions of decision-making power and a clear process to get there, gender equality, global security, and peace will never be realized.","The U.N. must be made more inclusive, accountable, democratic, effective, and reflective of a world in which political and economic power has shifted.","High corruption and the influence of big business and the wealthy elite keeps the poorest Nigerians trapped in poverty and cut off from the benefits of economic growth and basic services. Some people - searching for the means to survive - became vulnerable to groups like Boko Haram.","Billions of people are being left behind by economic growth.","Far too many governments are cutting back on their investment in human development.","Development cooperation between nations is very important because it is one of the building blocks of shared peace, prosperity, and human rights for all. It is one of the antidotes to the poison of xenophobia.","My own life values were shaped in great part by my mother, who instigated women's clubs in my village. Women were able to organize and stand together. What inspired me most about their work was the power it gave them to assert their rights and the rights of their daughters, be it education or property inheritance.","That a country has a strong civil society is, I believe, particularly necessary for good development.","The importance of tackling inequality in Africa cannot be overstated.","African countries lose billions every year because of tax dodging by big corporations and wealthy individuals. They lose billions more from overly generous tax incentives in a misguided belief that this is the only way to attract foreign investment.","Rather than engineering our economies solely to maximise GDP, Africa's business and political leaders must build economies explicitly designed to end poverty and inequality.","Instead of presiding over an economic system that panders to big business and a wealthy elite, a more human economy must be established which meets the needs of African women and young people.","Having an economy that works for the 99% is achievable.","Governments should end the extreme concentration of wealth in order to end poverty. This means tackling tax dodging but also increasing taxes on wealth and high incomes to ensure a more level playing field and generate the billions of dollars needed to invest in healthcare, education, and job creation.","We don't have to accept an economy that doesn't work just because some people have got rich in the status quo. That is not democracy.","I am still haunted by the memory of my Ugandan friends dying from HIV years ago because high prices kept the medicines they needed out of reach.","Democracy in Myanmar cannot be achieved with discrimination and gross violations of human rights.","Here's something we're rarely told growing up: our world rewards wealth, not hard work or talent.","The world belongs to the wealthy, and nowhere is this injustice more apparent than in the workplace.","Corporations are driving down wages and working conditions across the globe to maximize returns for their shareholders. They use their power and influence to ensure the rules align with their interests - no matter the cost.","We don't want to tell young girls and boys that the odds are stacked against them from the start. Instead, we could tell them that with passion, conviction, and determination we can build a better future. This future is possible by redesigning our economy to truly reward hard work rather than wealth.","Global governments should start seriously talking about the creation of a World Tax Authority with the mission to ensure that tax systems will deliver for the public interests in all countries.","Oxfam believes that any global talks to reform tax rules must include all countries, including the poorest.","Progressive taxation can offset the effect of growing inequality.","Taxing companies, particularly successful multinational companies, is one of the most progressive forms of taxation.","Developing countries are losing significant tax revenues through corporate tax dodging.","The conniving, rich oilmen that were so desperate to prevent and frustrate the Paris Agreement found cheerleaders in Mr. Trump and his party. They choose to protect their profits from a flailing fossil fuel industry over human lives and a clean, inclusive future for us all.","The Paris Agreement threw people of the world a lifeline, and the United States played a vital role in getting us there, not least by working closely with China to clear the decks to a global deal.","The move to a zero-carbon future is unstoppable.","Tackling the extreme gap between the rich and the poor and tackling climate change is part of the same struggle.","Inequality is inextricably linked with distribution of land and natural resources.","I'm ready to do any kind of work, as long as it absorbs my passion for making a just world and equal world.","I grew up thinking the most decent job to do was to fight injustice.","We have international organizations for health, trade, and football - even for coffee - but not tax. Why not?","Fundamental is the need for governments to protect the space for citizens to claim their rights, organize, and express themselves.","The people standing up most strongly for our democracies should be celebrated, not prosecuted - be it those countless human rights defenders who defend all our rights or the brave whistle-blowers who expose tax dodging.","Citizens need to know how their countries are being run so that they can hold governments and big business to account.","Investing in vital infrastructure will help to build more sustainable, equitable economies.","To build more human economies in Africa, governments must be far more strategic, wise, and forward-looking in their expenditure and build diverse economies that are going to deliver the jobs for the next generation.","Crucially, African governments must ensure they prioritize the eradication of tax evasion and tax avoidance.","Protecting space for civil society and citizenry is particularly critical in a world marked by rising political and economic inequality.","Governments and civil society must step up to ensure inclusivity in the commissioning, design, delivery, and assessment of vital public services.","The proud fight against colonialism is one that should be consigned to history.","People who are denied access to power are also denied the opportunity to make or influence decisions to live a better life out of poverty and claim their rights.","The concentration of wealth in the hands of the few threatens the ability of ordinary people to raise their voices and have a say over how our societies are run.","Rather than working for all, power and public policy is increasingly influenced by wealthy elites that are able to bend the rules - and hijack democratic institutions - to their favour.","The extremely wealthy have disproportionate influence on policies that impact us all. This corrupts our politics and leads to poorer people being denied the economic opportunity to flourish in life.","Money doesn't just buy a nice car; it also buys better education or healthcare. Increasingly, it can buy impunity from justice, a pliant media, favorable laws, business advantage, and even elections. This, in turn, perpetuates the policies that allow a tiny elite to accumulate ever more wealth at the expense of the majority.","A global tax body would give all countries - not just the rich and powerful - an equal say in how the global rules on taxation are designed.","Governments, the investor and business community, and civil society organizations and public representatives need to work together to ensure the necessary foundations are in place to align private finance to guarantee sustainable and equitable development and poverty reduction.","Global governance needs recalibrating so it works in the public interest of all the world's citizens - not just for the few.","Developing countries can make great strides towards more progressive and effective taxation and spending through action within their own borders. But the damage caused by exemptions, loopholes, and tax havens requires action beyond national borders - it requires international action and cooperation.","Ultimately, developing countries and groups like Oxfam want to see a new intergovernmental body on cooperation in tax matters under the auspices of the United Nations.","To reduce gaps between men and women, we will need to change the way people think, behave, and relate to each other.","It's happy and secure people who the are most creative.","You are not going to lift everybody out of poverty through the kindness of wealthy people.","I have learnt to enjoy my own company because I have lived alone many years.","I grew up really being able to stand up to authority.","Africa's young population could be a huge economic asset if inequality were addressed.","My life has been varied, involving many jobs, but I have always been impatient with injustice.","Poverty is a result of lack of opportunity. Lack of opportunity is about being without power, without being in a position to make choices.","If the civil society is not transparent, honest, and accountable, then you cannot be a champion of social justice.","I believe we can build a human economy where people are the bottom line.","We need a world where people do not have to live in fear of the economic repercussions of getting sick or losing their home or job. Where every child gets to fulfil their potential. Where corporations pay their fair share of taxes and work for the good of the majority, not just their shareholders.","Wealth is used to entrench inequality, not to trickle down and solve it.","We need to tackle extreme inequality because it is morally indefensible and socially corrosive - undermining our health, affecting our well-being, and undermining peaceful societies."],"Winnie Harlow":["I have my flaws, but I embrace them and I love them because they're mine.","I am the underdog, and I want to prove that one can follow one's dreams despite all the flaws and setbacks.","You can't let someone else lower your self-esteem, because that's what it is - self-esteem. You need to first love yourself before you have anybody else love you.","It's amazing what a little encouragement can do.","I am happy with my skin, and I'm proud of my skin, which is why I wear it so boldly. But if a job wanted me to, say, try a smoky eye and cover the vitiligo around my eye, I wouldn't have a problem with that.","I'm just living life. And if that inspires you, I'm proud, but I'm not going to put pressure on myself to be the best person in the world and tell everyone I have vitiligo. If you want to know about it, you can do your research. Either way, I'm not in the dictionary under 'vitiligo.'","When I got older, it got harder because when kids get older, they get meaner, so I went through a lot of bullying and people calling me, like, 'zebra' or 'cow,' so it was really hard growing up.","Focus on your opinion of yourself and not the opinion others have of you.","Vitiligo is just another difference, like freckles, big hair, tiny ears Everyone has differences.","You should be careful what you choose to see as a role model, whereas inspiration can come from anywhere.","I learned to love who I am despite what anyone would say about or to me. This gave me the courage to really stand up to anyone or any obstacle in my life.","I had to relearn how to love myself by forgetting the opinions of everyone else and focusing on my opinion of myself.","Some rules are there for a reason - but it's one thing to have a rule that protects and another to have rules that stifle.","I don't think it's good to focus on being celebrated but to celebrate yourself.","My modelling career is about hard work.","Kids called me a cow and mooed at me.","My parents separated before I was born, but they remained friends, so I was close to both sides of my family, with siblings and cousins and godparents. I've had the same best friend since grade six.","I wasn't born with vitiligo. It developed when I was 4 years old. My skin changed dramatically over the next few years.","I didn't have a problem with myself or my skin. I had a problem with the way people treated me because of my skin. They tried to define me.","If one day I'm all black, I'm still a model. If one day I'm all white, I'm still a model.","I've never been a die-hard Beyonce fan. I always thought she was inspirational and beautiful.","I love myself the way I am, but people will always message me about other people with vitiligo who cover their skin. 'Winnie Harlow, you need to tell them that they need to love themselves the way they are and stop covering their skin!' No! If that's what makes them comfortable and what makes them happy, let them be.","Regardless of what race, what color, what sex, what nationality, what sexual orientation - regardless of who you are, equality should always rule! Whatever is right for you is right. Period.","I feel like I pull inspiration from everyone, and I feel like I'm honored and grateful that people feel that they can pull inspiration from me, be inspired by me. But I definitely don't think I'm a role model. I'm not someone to be imitated.","The only person that can make you feel that you aren't beautiful is you.","If God wanted be to be black, I'd be black; if he wanted me to be white, I'd be white, so I guess He chose for me to be both and original. That's the way I'm supposed to be.","For me, honestly, the term 'role model' means for someone to be imitated, and I don't feel like anyone is to be imitated.","The more people see, the more they want to see.","People have black skin, people have brown skin. I have both.","I always loved the spotlight, just not the negativity.","Things were fine in elementary school, but when I moved schools in grade three, not only was I the new kid, I was the new kid with the skin condition.","Growing up, I didn't have a lot of real friends, and the people I was friends with, I've grown apart from - they were frenemies more than anything.","I think you have to feel your best by yourself. I do think it's important to have a solid friend that you can turn to, though - one that you can vent to.","I don't remember my skin changing, but I do recall feeling deeply loved by my family.","I liked to hang around my mom's beauty salon, watching her do hair.","A journalist in Toronto named Shannon Boodram saw my Facebook page and told me I was 'strikingly beautiful.' She shot a YouTube video of me, and it made a hit, grabbing thousands of views. She said the camera loved me and that I should be a model. I had never thought about modeling - it just hadn't seemed possible.","You think of floating on a rock in space as so alien, but that's exactly what we're doing.","I think we need to take a step back and realize what the real issues are - it's not being from different places or being different.","My mom will sometimes call me Winnie. It's so annoying. I'm like, 'Who are you talking to?'","Even as a little girl, my mom never wanted me to watch BET, but when I was at my grandparents' house, and my older cousins were there and I could watch it, I was infatuated with the idea that I could one day be a DJ or the host of a show.","Winnie Harlow is my alter ego like how Beyonce refers to her stage name as Sasha Fierce.","The worst thing I've done while sad is sit in defeat. That's very unhealthy. The best thing to do is dust yourself off and try again.","I loved myself. And with that, opportunities start to fall into my lap. And I thank God for all of them.","I was never raised as the daughter with vitiligo or the granddaughter with vitiligo or the cousin with vitiligo. I was just Chantelle.","I don't really talk about 'ANTM,' although I'm very grateful for it, as it was the platform that allowed me to catapult to where I should have been.","I remember sitting by my window, wishing upon the stars that my skin condition would go away. I wondered, 'Why me?'","People sometimes ask when I learned to love myself. But that was not the issue.","My confidence was more of a fake-it-until-you-make-it kind of thing. I tried to build my own confidence and not rely on the opinions of others.","I was a lucky kid, and I grew up connected to a lot of people.","I faced challenges as a kid, but who hasn't? A lot of people have experienced far worse. I was bullied, sure, and it was painful at the time. I even quit high school to get away from it. But I've never been the kind of person to let my past predict my future.","Social media is a great way to get discovered in the industry because it's free, it's worldwide, and everyone's on it - a very powerful combination.","Growing up in the greater Toronto area, I was a happy kid. I was my mother's first child, surrounded by admiring godparents and cousins.","I discovered that I was 'different' in the third grade. As the new kid at school, I was trying hard to find my footing. I thought I had made friends with a couple of girls - until they stopped talking to me. When I confronted them, they said their mothers had warned them to stay away because they might catch my skin condition.","With vitiligo, my skin is sensitive in extreme temperatures.","I loved reading magazines about the entertainment world.","It's weird to me for people to stare at me, because I feel like I'm normal. I don't see what there is to stare about.","I get comments saying that I'm a leper, I control how my skin changes, I bleach my skin, my skin's burned. None of those are true.","My skin's not a normal sight.","I feel like I have so many amazing opportunities because of my immigrant mother, my immigrant grandparents.","I wasn't part of the BeyHive before I met her, but after my experience working with her, meeting her, I'm a die-hard fan.","Funnily enough, of course I've always thought B was amazing, but I've never been, like, 'Beyhive status'... until actually meeting her. I would honestly drop anything I'm doing to work for her again. Not just because of who she is but because of my experience with her filming for two days.","There wasn't anyone who was specifically taking me under their wing. I definitely looked up to people, though, one major person being Naomi Campbell, of course. That's, like, a given.","I've always been a lot about beauty and products, and skincare and make-up.","I've been doing my own makeup since I was 15. I would steal my mom's products, go online, watch YouTube videos of girls doing their makeup, and try.","When I was in high school, I wanted to be so thick that I'd eat all the pizza and all the McDonald's and everything.","I don't do much cooking because it's impossible when you travel so much. You go grocery shopping, buy everything, and then get a call to fly out for two weeks. By the time you're back, all the food is rotten.","If you're not drinking enough water, or you're not eating enough vegetables, or you're not working out enough, or you're not getting your toxins out, I feel like it always reflects.","To be completely honest, I never thought I could become a model growing up. I actually wanted to be an entertainment journalist.","Nick Knight was my first big gig as a 'real' model. Prior to and during 'ANTM,' I never actually called myself a model because I always viewed it as a hobby.","I want to see different faces on the covers of magazines, the stars of movies, featured on billboards.","My sense of fashion has developed a lot.","Like any other kid, I was trying so hard to fit in that school made no sense to me. I wasn't attending class; I was trying to hang out in the caf with the cool kids. I was always trying to be cool.","I'm very sick of talking about my skin.","With my skin, I have to avoid direct contact with the sun, so that, combined with my mom being conservative, meant I grew up wearing stockings under shorts and long sleeves under tank tops. It was kind of embedded in me that I was supposed to be covering up.","I try to keep my skincare routine very simple and don't put too much on my face.","A lot of people ask me how I keep my skin fairly smooth and avoid breakouts, and I think that's because I always take off my make-up before I go to bed, and I mean really take it off.","If I'm running around or just hanging out at home, then I barely wear any make-up.","I love to play with make-up. I adapt my beauty look to my outfit, so as soon as I know what I'm wearing, I know if I want to go for a red lip or a smoky eye. I usually won't put those two together, but it all depends on what outfit I'm going for.","I am literally just a human. I have the same brain as you; there's a skeleton under my skin just like yours.","I'm not a vitiligo spokesperson just because I have vitiligo.","I feel like I am an inspiration. That's the word I prefer. I don't believe that I have to be a role model, someone to be emulated.","Chantelle Winnie is my birth name. Chantelle Winnie Harlow, I call her my Sasha Fierce.","I definitely hope and I feel that I am inspiring, but I don't like the word 'role model.'","I feel like people put too much on the title of a role model.","I don't perm my hair anymore, but I'm not a natural hair expert just because it grows out of my head like that.","I could more label myself as even a spokeswoman for happiness!","We lived on our own for a very long time, and those are my happiest years, me and my mom.","For me personally, I have vitiligo, so my whole career, it's always been this very odd debate: 'Does she want to be white? Is she white and black? Is her mum white?' It's always been this question of my background, my race, and what I stand for.","When I was young, I was picked on for something that today I feel is amazing. One thing about me connects millions of people around the world. And it's my skin condition - vitiligo.","Chantelle Brown-Young is my real name. Winnie is my nickname that I was given as a teenager, and it has stuck with me. I've combined my real name and my nick name to create 'Chantelle Winnie.' My alter ego, where I seek confidence when I model, is 'Winnie Harlow.'","I am not my skin. I am a model with a skin condition.","I'm happy to inspire your seven-year-old child, but I do not want to be her role model.","I give kudos to people like Zendaya who are like, 'Yes, I want to inspire young kids.' And I'm like, 'Girl, that's a lot of work!'","I more so appreciate people loving the fact that I love myself and not just glorifying my skin or me.","My skin's not a normal sight. When a photographer says, 'I don't know what it is, but that's just not it...' I know. They like the different colours of my skin. They're not getting them with a particular outfit.","There is beauty in everything.","If humans want to see the same types of people over and over, that's what industries will give us. If we want to see something different, that's what they'll have to give us.","I don't want to be put in a category."],"Winnie Holzman":["I loved the whole idea, first of all, of what friendship is. Very often, there are people that somehow you don't know how to declare that you are their friend, but you are their friend. That happens in a lot in high school. And outside of high school.","When you're doing a series, you're really in a zone. You're thinking about those characters and their situations in a free-floating way all the time. They live with you all the time. So it's just as natural as breathing to be having ideas and thinking about what they're thinking about.","Series television is kind of intensive in terms of time. You fall hard for TV writing, but it's almost love-hate. You're under pressure all the time, but that pressure gets interesting things out of you that are, you know, mysterious.","The whole idea of a dream, to me, is a mystery plane. Things are operating there that tell us the real truth. The stuff going on inside us that we don't express or even know about pours out in our dreams.","I consider myself a writer. I always wanted to act, and as a teen, I studied acting devotedly. Eventually, I got writing work, but very little acting work.","I realized later how much my acting experience influenced my writing and how it helped me to write for other actors.","I care about actors, and I understand them in a very personal way. I'm not saying every writer has to do that, but in my case, it's been helpful. I can put myself into the scene and think, 'What would it be like to act this?' Any writer who's really good probably does that to some extent.","I don't think of myself as a producer. In television, it's part of the business - if you progress and become successful as a writer, you're called a writer-producer. What that means is that you have a lot of say in casting and behind-the-scenes stuff. But I'm just a writer.","The discovery I made was that, really, in America, if you went to high school in our country, it doesn't really matter where you went to high school. In a funny way, all high schools are the same.","In my life, it's always been about who I'm going to collaborate with. Less important to me is what the subject is.","As a writer who has collaborated on projects, you give your life over to that project.","This is embarrassing to admit, but I didn't really know anything about Pearl Jam. Of course, I knew who they were, but I had never really sampled them.","I'm certainly a real homebody. But the truth is that I understand that desire to, in a way, go join the circus. That's what got me out of Long Island and into show business. I was like, 'I'm just going to have an adventure. I want to be a person that isn't surrounded by their mail and their cat.'","I really learned that, when I got into television, I really learned the power, how deeply it affects people to see themselves on television, to see something that they can relate to, that they feel is like them in some way; people feel validated. Its not a little thing. It really means a lot to people. It actually can change people.","Camp is like this set-apart world where people go to try to change who they are, and yet change is really scary.","I do love the idea of people at a certain time in their lives when they're questioning, figuring out who to be. I find that interesting, but honestly, I think it's like that at every time in your life.","For me, being a writer, you want to communicate with people, but if your goal is that every person is going to love what you do, then you're always going to be disappointed.","The Huntington Theatre has a really fine reputation. I was keenly aware of how well thought of they are and that they develop and support new plays.","I think you end up writing things you like. I like seeing actors playing two different parts at the same time. I think it's interesting. It kind of shows you two sides of a person."],"Winnie Madikizela-Mandela":["One of the greatest things I fear is letting down my people. I wouldn't live with that type of conscience, of having let down my people after they've been brutalized for so long.","I never talk about my private life.","It dawned on me then that you either had to survive apartheid, or you had to perish with it. And I decided to survive.","The brutality of apartheid drains you of that emotion of fear if you have gone through everything you can be put through in the process of harassment.","I believe in myself and the justice I've fought for all my life.","I don't want a grand villa in a rich suburb alongside white people where many of my former comrades choose to live. I would never betray my roots in that way.","I'm not ashamed of anything I've ever done in the name of fairness and justice for my people.","We should have sent the apartheid monsters to jail, not let them off with an amnesty.","I learned to deal with the police... to be tough... to survive.","I'm like thousands of women in South Africa who lost their men to cities and prisons... I stand defiant, tall and strong.","Politicians are not lovers.","There is nothing the government has not done to me. There isn't any pain I haven't known.","The years of imprisonment hardened me... Perhaps if you have been given a moment to hold back and wait for the next blow, your emotions wouldn't be blunted as they have been in my case. When it happens every day of your life, when that pain becomes a way of life... there is no longer anything I can fear.","I have a good relationship with Mandela. But I am not Mandela's product. I am the product of the masses of my country and the product of my enemy.","I knew what it is to hate.","When I was born, my mother was very disappointed. She wanted a son. I knew that from a very early age. So I was a tomboy.","I wanted to be a doctor at some point, and I was always bringing home strays from school: people who were too poor to pay fees or have food. My parents never rebuked me or told me that they were hard-pressed, too.","This name Mandela is an albatross around the necks of my family.","I am not sorry. I will never be sorry. I would do everything I did again if I had to. Everything.","The ANC has failed to address the problems of the black majority quickly enough.","The life of the President's First Lady would not have been for me. And I don't know how I would have been as a housewife.","They think because they have put my husband on an island that he will be forgotten. They are wrong. The harder they try to silence him, the louder I will become.","I am a living symbol of the white man's fear. I never realized how deeply embedded this fear is until I came to Brandfort.","I identify... with the ideas that Malcolm X stood for.","I am not the sort of person to carry beautiful flowers and be an ornament to everyone.","Nelson was locked up on Robben Island, and wives like me had been warned we would bring our husbands home as corpses from that place. But I always believed he would be released. It was my duty to have a home ready for us.","We have a shared destiny, a shared responsibility to save the world from those who attempt to destroy it.","I don't say we should have performed miracles, but surely there ought to have been a difference between the apartheid regime and governance of the ANC after 17 years.","It would be a most despicable thing to suggest I would exploit the poor for my own personal gain.","The solution of this country's problems lies in black hands.","I often wonder why I attract so much criticism.","No one under international copyright law has the right to depict me or my husband without our consent. I have been surprised by the many people, particularly Americans, who are either writing books or going to produce films about the Mandela family without even bothering to consult us.","We cannot pretend we do not have problems; we cannot pretend things are not wrong in our country. A lot of things are wrong.","We talk of a rainbow nation - in a country that remains dichotomized between black and white. We must acknowledge that the rainbow, in fact, is still a dream.","The government can become so elitist and concentrate on elitist interests. To help the government, you must constantly hold its attention.","I was so hooked by the fight for freedom that nothing mattered to us so long as we fulfilled the dream of years and years of our people being liberated. I thought normal life would come the day after.","It is any wife's dream to lead a normal life with her family.","You build dreams, you build castles in the air, and you hope that at least part of that will be realized, even under apartheid.","You all must realize that Mandela was not the only man who suffered. There were many others - hundreds who languished in prison and died. Many unsung and unknown heroes of the struggle.","In the normal course of things, journalists want their story, and as soon as they are through with it, they pack their cameras and go. That was never the impression that David Astor gave when you were interviewed by him. It was far deeper than that.","To me, David Astor was a freedom fighter. To me, he wasn't just a journalist; he was a freedom fighter.","Mandela did go to prison, and he went in there as a burning revolutionary. But look what came out. Mandela let us down.","I was married to the ANC. It was the best marriage I ever had.","Those 18 months in solitary confinement... bruised my soul. If I had had a weapon, I would have fought my way out.","My continent knows more about me than I do myself.","As much as the South African racist regime is prepared to fight to the last man, so are we determined to fight to the bitter end.","We shall liberate our country."],"Winona LaDuke":["The idea that you can dress up in some kind of a fake Indian outfit and get on stage is somehow acceptable in this country. That has to do with the fact that you have the Redskins, the Braves, you have people who dress up like Indians, people dress up like Indians on Halloween. That is acceptable.","Post office closures in the Dakotas and Minnesota will impact many communities, but the White Earth reservation villages, and other tribal towns of Squaw Lake, Ponemah, Brookston in Minnesota, and Manderson, Wounded Knee and Wakpala (South Dakota) as well as Mandaree in North Dakota will mean hardships for a largely Native community.","Mother Earth needs us to keep our covenant. We will do this in courts, we will do this on our radio station, and we will commit to our descendants to work hard to protect this land and water for them. Whether you have feet, wings, fins, or roots, we are all in it together.","In the end, there is no absence of irony: the integrity of what is sacred to Native Americans will be determined by the government that has been responsible for doing everything in its power to destroy Native American cultures.","Food for us comes from our relatives, whether they have wings or fins or roots. That is how we consider food. Food has a culture. It has a history. It has a story. It has relationships.","I see a lot of damage to Mother Earth. I see water being taken from creeks where water belongs to animals, not to oil companies.","What we all need to do is find the wellspring that keeps us going, that gives us the strength and patience to keep up this struggle for a long time.","I look at my own reservation, the White Earth reservation in northern Minnesota - on my reservation, one quarter of our money is spent on energy. All of that money basically goes to off-reservation vendors whether it is for electricity, or whether it is for fuel.","Oil is drowning our oceans and drowning our boreal forests.","If we moved from industrialized agriculture to re-localized organic agriculture, we could sequester about one quarter of the carbon moving into the air and destroying our glaciers, oceans, forests and lands.","Tribes have the potential to provide almost 15 percent of the country's electricity with wind power, and have 4.5 times the solar resources to power the entire U.S.","The first thing I am is a person. I am a woman. And I am part of a nation, the Indian nation. But people either relate to you as an Indian or as a woman. They relate to you as a category. A lot of people don't realize that I am not that different from everyone else.","In the time of the sacred sites and the crashing of ecosystems and worlds, it may be worth not making a commodity out of all that is revered.","America is so accustomed to some depiction of native people that is entirely racist, and there's a perception that that is okay.","Ojibwe prophecy speaks of a time during the seventh fire when our people will have a choice between two paths. The first path is well-worn and scorched. The second path is new and green. It is our choice as communities and as individuals how we will proceed.","I'm interested in what kind of food we're going to eat as the climate changes. I'm interested in what kind of economy we're going to have in another 1,000 years.","Native people - about two-thirds of the uranium in the United States is on indigenous lands. On a worldwide scale, about 70 percent of the uranium is either in Aboriginal lands in Australia or up in the Subarctic of Canada, where native people are still fighting uranium mining.","I wanted to get out of Ashland, and I thought it would be pretty cool to go to school in the East. So I asked my guidance counselor what Ivy League schools were. And I applied to Harvard, Yale and Dartmouth - that was it. My guidance counselor told me I wouldn't get into an Ivy League school. So as my act of resistance, that's all I applied to.","Food sovereignty is an affirmation of who we are as indigenous peoples and a way, one of the most surefooted ways, to restore our relationship with the world around us.","Spirituality is the foundation of all my political work.","The thing about being an Indian person is that you feel most at home with your own people.","In most of America, it seems you don't matter if you're not between 25 and 50.","On my reservation, we had one of the most abundant fisheries in the world and hundreds of thousands of acres of wild rice beds. We've lost a lot of it, but there's still natural wealth that could support our communities.","The reality is, is that the military is full of native nomenclature. That's what we would call it. You've got Black Hawk helicopters, Apache Longbow helicopters. You've got Tomahawk missiles. The term used when you leave a military base in a foreign country is to go 'off the reservation, into Indian Country.'","The United States, you know, people - one of the reasons that it is said that native people received citizenship in 1924 was so that they could be drafted. And they have been extensively drafted.","The United States - you know, native people are large landowners, but the military has a huge chunk of our territories. And in those, there are a number of places that are our sacred sites.","I think of some of my friends who have passed to the spirit world but are who here with me when I go to events and when I walk in my own community. My sisters, Ingred, my sister Marsha, and my sister Nielock. All cofounders of the Indigenous Women's Network with me. All long time women activists in the native community.","Eliminating some 3600 post offices - mostly rural - will save the USPS less than seven tenths of one percent of their operating budget, but nationally, a number of tribal communities will be hit.","I'm Harvard-educated; I'm an economist by training. I'm an author, a journalist, as well as being active in community development.","Actually, I consider myself to be pretty politically conservative.","We filed a constitutional rights lawsuit on my reservation, and I had to go out and interview all these old people. And I found that many of the old people on my reservation didn't know who was president. That kind of pointed out to me the irrelevance at times of who is in Washington.","Now that I think about it, I was arrested in 1992. Some people may think of that as a bad thing, but I feel good about it. I chained myself to the gate of a phone book factory, a GTE factory in Los Angeles. They were using thousand-year-old trees to make phone books. I think that's a total waste of a tree.","When I first came to Harvard, I thought to myself, 'What kind of an Indian am I?' because I did not grow up on a reservation. But being an Indian is a combination of things. It's your blood. It's your spirituality. And it's fighting for the Indian people.","I used to go to some Harvard parties with my athlete friends, and they would introduce me as 'Winona, the Indian activist.' It made me uncomfortable. I felt like a novelty.","We are launching a campaign called Wind, Not War, which is about the alternatives to a fossil-fuels-based economy and looking at wind, an alternative energy, as key to that in terms of issues of global climate change as well as issues of democracy.","If you're going to spend most of your time in your democracy figuring out how to get oil by intervening into other people's countries and insuring that you follow it with military might, we think there's an alternative. Which would be renewable energy."],"Winona Ryder":["What you wear - and it always starts with your shoes - determines what kind of character you are. A woman who wears high heels carries herself very different to a girl who wears sneakers or sandals. It really helps determine how you carry yourself.","When you finally accept that it's OK not to have answers and it's OK not to be perfect, you realize that feeling confused is a normal part of what it is to be a human being.","I'm getting asked a lot, 'You don't have kids, so how do you know how to act like a mother?' I know nothing could compare, and I haven't had that experience, but when my niece was born, I felt like I would jump in front of a car and die for this little person I didn't even know yet.","Weird people follow you in the streets, you can't sit alone in a restaurant or a cafe and read a book in peace, and I think everybody values those moments of being alone.","I've always been fascinated with twins.","People think that they just want movies like Pretty Woman, when really they - at least the ones that I know personally - have been waiting for something that doesn't completely insult them.","I was regarded as the school freak which further reinforced a lot of inhibitions and doubts I had about myself. I was a shy, frightened teenager for a long time.","My favourite performances are by actresses like Bette Davis in 'All About Eve' or Gena Rowlands in pretty much anything - performances that have nothing to do with age.","As a teenager, I worked on Indian reservations, and it was such an incredible culture: the elders are so respected.","I would have to say 'The Crucible' stands out because it was one of the best experiences I've ever had, but, you know, Arthur Miller being present on the set - which was wonderful and incredible - but, to have him in your eye line is quite intimidating. It's such a beautiful language he created, so that was challenging but exciting.","I want to be a good friend, a good sister, a good person and a good actress.","You've got to grow up sometime.","I have this sense that I didn't really start growing up until my twenties.","I'm so sick of people shaming women for being sensitive or vulnerable. It's so bizarre to me... I do have those qualities, and I just don't think there's anything wrong with them.","The older you get, the more yourself you can be and the less worried you are about what other people think.","You can't pay enough money to... cure that feeling of being broken and confused.","People don't realise how much tension they hold in their forearms.","There was a time when all that mattered was that you were in a good movie.","It's an indication of how cynical our society has become that any kind of love story with a sad theme is automatically ridiculed as sentimental junk.","I was very lucky because Tim Burton really gave me a career. I don't think Hollywood would've known what to do with me. If I hadn't done 'Beetlejuice,' I think I would've just gone back to my school.","I'm used to being told what to say, but not what to think... that's usually left up to me.","I'm just coming from a more personal - and, I guess, more nostalgic - point of view.","I've learned that it's OK to be flawed.","I don't believe I am influencing anybody but myself.","I was watching TV, and there was this oldies-but-goodies film fest, and 'Lucas' came on. I was like, 'Oh my God, I'm an oldie!'","It's great concentrating so hard you feel your brain will explode.","I binge-watched this show 'Damages.' Glenn Close and Rose Byrne are so good. Lily Tomlin is in it. You see all these great actors, and the writing is terrific. There are a lot of shows like that.","I've been embracing aging. I always have, since I was a kid. When you're the kid on the set for so long, you just, like, daydream about being older.","It's equally as important to me to be a good friend and a good sister and a good daughter. I'm very close with my family and friends.","It's all about knowing when to listen to that conversation and - without sounding really hokey - when to tune it out and follow your heart.","I love books and going to bookstores. My favorite sound is the sound of the needle hitting the record.","I don't use the Internet, but apparently you can find out everything on it.","I am not a person who can really sit around and think about regrets because with every bad experience that you have, there is weirdly something good that comes from it.","I was single for a while and dating and... I just didn't know how to do it! I've always been like that: when I was 15, there was a guy I liked, and we made out, and I thought that meant he was my boyfriend.","When your parents are madly in love for 45 years, your standards are really high.","I wanted to be just a normal girl flirting with a normal guy. It's like, you meet people, and they know this stuff about you. It's why you want to meet somebody who's in the same business, only because they understand more. But you don't necessarily want to be with another actor.","I went from weirdo teenager to pixie waif to them not knowing what the hell to do with me.","When I was young, I was the sweetheart of the press. They loved me but were kind of waiting for me to mess up. I had no skeletons in my closet, no major past to talk about.","I definitely count my blessings. I feel like I've had such a great ride. Early on, to be able to work with some of the people I did, I feel really lucky.","I'm not interested in playing the girl that's just there to make the guy, you know, give him a talking to.","I'm not into older guys. To tell you the truth, Richard Gere is not the sexiest man alive, in my book.","It's also a question of finding good material and interesting roles. I'm not the only actress out there, and good parts just don't fall into your lap that easily. But I like most of the films I've made recently and so I'm pretty positive about the future.","You try to get out there and live. I've always had good friends who've been very supportive and help make me feel good and grounded because I've never felt attached to the film industry.","I don't hang out with agents and producers and I'm not into the business side at all.","But I've always felt a need to have a life which is completely separate - at least as far as possible - from the kind of illusory lifestyle that comes with being a celebrity.","That's an aspect of this business which can be very frustrating and aggravating. Most of what is written about you is wrong and so much of what does get printed is often about personal things that you don't want to have other people read about.","It's part of the celebrity process but my life has never been as interesting or as wild as what's been printed about me.","Money doesn't matter on a deeply personal level. It doesn't make you feel any happier. But of course I am very aware that I don't have to worry about earning a living or about those very important practical things that most people have to worry about on a very real level.","It's just people should realize that the celebrity aspect of being an actor is very rarely enjoyable for people like me who would always rather go unnoticed and disappear into the crowd.","Remember, I'm the kind of kid who used to get stuffed into a locker by school bullies. I've never felt like I'm a big star at any level of my life.","My dad took me to all the best rock and punk shows when I was growing up and music has always been a part of my life. So I'm very interested in the music scene and I suppose that's why I've ended up going out with musicians. Dave Pirner is still one of my best friends.","I think I'm learning to be bolder in my career choices and be more confident in my personal life. I haven't always felt very secure as an individual, but now I feel I certain confidence and sense of self that gets me through the day a lot better than before.","You go through spells where you feel that maybe you're too sensitive for this world. I certainly felt that.","There was a time when I was 19 when I really, really, really thought I was going crazy. I was exhausted and going through a terrible depression.","I feel my best when I'm happy.","I'm not into wrinkles.","It's really good to be able to think about past loves without having a pit in my stomach, or cringing or feeling heart-broken, or like they hate you. Don't you think?","I was very depressed after breaking off my engagement with Johnny ten years ago. I was embarrassingly dramatic at the time, but you have to remember I was only 19 years old.","Break-ups are hard for anybody, but it's particularly tough when it's being documented and you see the person's picture everywhere. Most people don't have that added problem when they break up with someone.","I'm quite comfortable looking at myself in movies, probably because I've been doing it for so long, since I was a kid. So I sort of watched myself grow up and go through adolescence, like, basically on camera.","If I showed you scripts from my first few movies, the descriptions of my characters all said 'the ugly girl'.","For a long time, I was almost ashamed of being an actress. I felt like it was a shallow occupation. People would be watching my every move.","My father is an atheist. My mother is Buddhist. They encouraged my siblings and me to take the best part of other religions to make our own belief system.","I love westerns. John Ford is one of the 10 best directors.","What's awful about being famous and being an actress is when people come up to you and touch you. That's scary, and they just seem to think it's okay to do it, like you're public property.","My parents are awesome, but they're pretty left-wing.","I think I really scored with my parents. All of my friends pretty much came from broken homes, and my parents are still together, but not only that, they're still in love and still write together.","I was inspired by lots of people, certainly in acting and in writing and stuff, but I never wanted to be somebody else.","I loved movies, but I can't remember ever really wanting to be an actress, and I certainly didn't imagine ever being in a movie. I think I wanted to be a writer.","Even though 'Heathers' didn't make a lot of money, I really was able to transition into a situation where people thought I could play an attractive role because of it.","I've loved making movies. I feel like I've been so lucky because I've gotten to be in movies that are some of my favorites, regardless of my being in them - like 'Heathers.'","Life's short, so if you're going to spend months doing something, it's gotta be pretty special... But I'm very happy to enter my Baby Jane years, and hopefully segue into the Ruth Gordon years.","I think it's important to have as much as a normal life and take the time to get perspective because it only helps your work in the long run.","I'm the type who'd rather not work than work on something I'm not into. I've done that a couple of times, and I feel like I can totally see it in my performance.","I would love to someday do a play. I did one when I was very young in San Francisco, where I grew up. A girl can dream.","I love photography and first editions. I have that in my genes. My father was an archivist.","I feel like I had to learn how to take care of myself and find out what made me happy aside from just making films.","Googling yourself is maybe one of the worst things you can do. I did it once, and someone had to talk me off a ledge.","I love getting older. I think it has to do with always being the kid on set.","I'd rather never have been married than been divorced a few times. Not that there's anything wrong with divorce, but I don't think I could do it if that was a possibility.","You have to work to be relevant. If you don't, then people will forget, and the studios won't want you because they won't remember the last thing you did that made money.","It used to be that you commit to something, and then basically you spend your year doing that. Now there's a constant conversation of how you have to keep working in order to remind people that you're around.","I was fired from a movie because I did 'Heathers!' I was cast in a movie, and the director saw an advance screening and was offended by it and fired me.","I remember when I was about 18, Sean Penn made a bet with me. He had just directed his first movie, and he's like, 'By the time you're 30, I will bet you $500 that you'll be sick of acting.' I'm still waiting to collect, because I'm not.","I wish I could unknow this, but there is a perception of me that I'm super-sensitive and fragile. And I am super-sensitive, and I don't think that that's a bad thing. To do what I do, I have to remain open.","I get sent a lot of scripts where you're just the mom.","I love watching old movies, and I read a lot of autobiographies.","Apparently, Bette Davis and a lot of actresses had a hard time in their 30s, too.","When I'm acting well, it's the most exhilarating experience. When I'm bad, it's miserable.","I have my email on my Blackberry, and that's about it.","There's a couple of times that I did it for the... paycheck. Even when I was younger - I remember I did this movie that wasn't good, called '1969.' I totally did it 'cause I could get out of school.","I can see it in even great actors' performances, when they're phoning it in.","With 'Ed Wood,' I sobbed. With 'Frankenweenie,' I was crying. With 'Edward Scissorhands,' I always cry. There's always an incredible amount of purity, even if they look a certain way.","On the set for 'Beetlejuice,' it was before people would go watch on monitors, and directors would be next to the camera.","It's interesting because, even with 'Beetlejuice,' I was an awkward kid. I started at puberty and went through it on film. Lydia was one of my favorite roles because I related to her a lot.","I just did what I found interesting. I was so lucky that I was able to do that, especially in the '90s. I was really able to have a life to go back to.","I did this little movie I really love called 'Experimenter,' but that took six years to get made and no money.","I'm not someone like Norma Desmond who's harking back to her younger days.","I would not want to go back to playing the ingenue.","I did 'Beetlejuice,' and it was a big movie, but it didn't help my high-school experience. In fact, it made it worse. I was a freak and a witch.","One of my worst fears is being a self-indulgent person.","I've always been super-private and protective of certain experiences and certain friends.","My home is San Francisco - that is definitely what I consider my home.","Some people go to L.A. just to see recognizable people. There are tour buses. But in New York, everyone seems a little less into that.","Usually, the roles that you get offered that are the mom roles are very much the mom role.","The Duffers can be super articulate or very straight to the point. I was really impressed with how they were with each other.","There are certain directors who will start talking to you about something, and suddenly you'll be ready to roll, and you'll realize it was very specific.","Scorsese would talk to me about this movie 'The Heiress' with Olivia de Havilland. We were talking about this scene in it, and suddenly we were rolling. It was very intentional, and I didn't realize - because we talk old movies all the time.","I don't have any interest in being a movie star.","It was hard to find that transition to adult roles.","In real life, and for women everywhere, no matter what their job is, your 30s and your 40s and beyond should be celebrated.","Part of me feels like when you had a lot of success in your teens and 20s, it gets harder for you in your 30s because people are so attached to you as this ingenue. So even though you're older, they still think of you as that girl - that waifish young girl. And so it was sort of like a struggle.","Remember when you were a kid, and everyone used to say, 'Would you rather be interested or interesting?' And to me, it was always like, 'Interested!' How is that even a question? I feel very lucky that I'm just really, really interested in a lot of things.","I'm part of the crew obsessed with 'The Wire.' Like, I'm not over that yet.","I don't have a director's mind.","Even though I never really had to pound the pavement as an actor, I always worked really hard. But, at the same time, I always felt like people thought that I didn't have to struggle even though I was struggling.","I approached work very seriously. I never went out. I couldn't fathom people who could go out to clubs... I mean, if I had a 6 A.M. call, I had to be prepared. I had to be in bed at a certain hour.","My problems seemed so glamorous to other people, and everyone just thought I was so lucky. But then, I was lucky because my family was really there for me - San Francisco was a real refuge.","It's like, sometimes I'll watch a movie, and it's got some big star in it playing a working-class person, and the character is in a grocery store, and you can kind of tell, from just watching the scene, that this actor doesn't do their own shopping. So you have to have some sense of reality.","I feel a little stronger than people perceive me.","I was unusual looking - I didn't have the look of that time. If you look at 'Lucas' - and, basically, my first five or six movies - the characters are not described in the scripts as attractive people.","Honestly, if it wasn't for 'Beetlejuice,' where would I be? That movie was a big thing for me.","I remember a lot of conversations where I was constantly hearing, 'You've gotta do this movie so you can do that movie. You've gotta make a big movie so you can make a small movie.' But I can't act like that.","When I think about the stuff I've turned down or the stuff I wasn't interested in, I don't have any regrets. Yes, there were some movies that went on to be really popular. But now, how do they really fit into things?","I would never give advice, because I would feel very presumptuous.","The 1980s was the era of the blonde cheerleader.","The description of my character in the first few movies I did was always 'nerdy,' but I liked that; it was way more interesting."],"Winslow Homer":["You will see - in the future, I will live by my watercolors.","You can't get along without a knowledge of the principles and rules governing the influence of one color upon another.

What they call talent is nothing but the capacity for doing continuous hard work in the right way.","A man is known by his works. That I have heard at many a funeral.","The life that I have chosen gives me my full hours of enjoyment for the balance of my life: the sun will not rise, or set, without my notice and thanks.","I wouldn't go across the street to see a Bouguereau. His pictures look false; he does not get the truth of what he wishes to represent. His light is not outdoor light; his works are waxy and artificial. They are extremely near being frauds.","Only once in the last thirty years have I made a duplicate, and that was a watercolor from my oil picture now owned by the Layton Art Gallery, Milwaukee, called 'Hark! the Lark.'","When will you learn that the time to buy a thing is when you find what you want? If you go back the next year and try to get more, they will try to sell you something else.","I do not care to put out any ideas for pictures. They are too valuable and can be appropriated by any art student, defrauding me out of a possible picture.","The sun will not rise or set without my notice, and thanks.","If a man wants to be an artist, he must never look at pictures.","The slavery at Bufford's was too fresh in my recollection to let me care to bind myself again. From the time that I took my nose off that lithographic stone, I have had no master, and never shall have any.","It is certainly a most tremendous and unprecedented honor and distinction that I have received from Pittsburgh. Let us hope that it is not too late in my case to be of value to American art in something that I may yet possibly do from this encouragement.","I don't want a lot of people nosing round my studio and bothering me. I don't want to see them at all. Let the dealers have all that bother.","Anything written or printed under a print or picture takes the attention from it and, if it is very black or white in any marked degree, will utterly destroy its beauty.","With the duckets that I now have safe, I think I will retire at 66 years of age, praise God, in good health.","Every condition must be favorable, or I do not work and will not.","Do not think that I have stopped painting, for at any moment, I am liable to paint a good picture.","I prefer every time a picture composed and painted outdoors.","This making studies and then taking them home to use them is only half right. You get composition, but you lose freshness; you miss the subtle and, to the artist, the finer characteristics of the scene itself.","Mr. C. Klackner has for sale four etchings etched by myself, at the expense of two years' time & hard work - 'The Life Line,' 'Peril on the Sea,' 'Eight Bells,' 'Mending Tears,' - all of which are very good and should have been put forward long ago, but C. Klackner is waiting for me to die, is my idea of the matter.","I decide to go direct to Key West... I know the place quite well, and it's near the points in Florida that I wish to visit. I have an idea at present of doing some work but do not know how long that will last."],"Winston Churchill":["Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.","Attitude is a little thing that makes a big difference.","I may be drunk, Miss, but in the morning I will be sober and you will still be ugly.","Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.","If you're going through hell, keep going.","Continuous effort - not strength or intelligence - is the key to unlocking our potential.","We make a living by what we get, but we make a life by what we give.","My most brilliant achievement was my ability to be able to persuade my wife to marry me.","Never, never, never give up.","The price of greatness is responsibility.","Courage is what it takes to stand up and speak; courage is also what it takes to sit down and listen.","You have enemies?

I think he has such a great understanding and distinct voice of his own.","I grew up with comic books, and I'm from the Caribbean, so comic books were really a great interrogator of American culture for me.","I grew up under the politics of my size and my skin. I grew up under the politics of the sound of my voice and a lack of agency, or a feeling of a lack of agency, and not always being able to find myself in images that were in the media.","Knowing that your sense of fashion and the culture it's connected to is valid really makes it a stronger thing for you."],"Winston Graham":["All I knew was that I was writing something out of my very guts, and that I was content.","I have been under considerable pressure to buy at least a laptop computer. I have always turned the suggestions down for the reason that I have never done creative work on a typewriter. There is to me a lack of empathy.","Give me the comma of imperfect striving, thus to find zest in the immediate living. Ever the reaching but never the gaining, ever the climbing but never the attaining of the mountain top."],"Winston Marshall":["The trick to techno, as a connoisseur, is that you got to do two things: keep your hands down and your mouth shut.","I'm a modern-day renaissance man.","The less I try, the cooler I am.","Elton John is an absolute lad. He's a hero.","For me, food and music are very similar in that you create, you spend a lot of time making something, and it only lasts a few seconds or a few minutes.","I've seen the Stones play for three hours, and the crowd knew every song. It's what you want in a headline slot at a festival.","My dream is to tour for 50 years.","We're in a long line of English people pretending to be Americans and not being as good as Americans.","You can never really tell what your influences are.","The New Lost City Ramblers are a very good comparison, actually. They really took the music seriously, and we take the music very seriously. But we don't take ourselves seriously at all.","We formed the band because we wanted to tour. That was our common interest.","One of the things we say in this band is if it's not fun, it's not worth doing.","We're not, like, hard men.","Technically, I suppose I was following all the right behavior patterns of a trustafarian.","We're a pretty emotional bunch. You know, someone doesn't say hello to you one day and you're like, 'I cannot believe the gall!'","England's just very cynical.","We get accused of inauthenticity because we play the instruments we play.","It's very important, when everyone else seems to be pigeon-holing you, to try and pigeon-hole yourself.","If you can't pigeon-hole yourself, who can you pigeon-hole?","Every day is a learning day.","We play the instruments we love.","Banjos are funny instruments. They can get pretty irritating.","We were copying lots of bands, like Avett Brothers and Old Crow Medicine Show.","You're always thinking about making new music.","We're all big fans of bluegrass.","Banjos are used in Celtic, English folk music and obviously American music. But not that much in pop music. But it's more versatile than people realise it to be. It's a beautiful instrument, very rhythmic and melodic. You can do anything with it.","Just being thought of as a Christian is pretty annoying. Not that there's anything wrong with it. But just being told you're anything when you're not.","'Babel' is a continuation of a project; it's not like now we are more theatrical. We've grown up, seen places, been places, and that is shown in this album.","I think that's why so many school bands start on guitars: because they hide their mistakes with the distortion.","Banjos, dobros, and acoustic guitars are not our first instruments.","When we first started touring, we were going to these towns we'd never otherwise go to, never otherwise see, and that's sort of why we like being in a band. But we started playing these bigger rooms and not even seeing the towns.","Things got big quickly for us, and playing arenas... it's like - and every band will tell you this - you don't see any of the town.","Class is a big issue here. And some people get picked on more than others. I think we probably do. I mean, it doesn't help that we wear waistcoats and tweed the whole time. But there is a reverse snobbishness in England towards that sort of stuff. And I think that's one of the reasons we really enjoy America, 'cos we're classless.","The thing about Nashville that's amazing is everyone plays... so you don't meet up for a drink, you meet up for a pick. It's an incredibly creative town, just bubbling with energy.","It's always great to see grey hairs in a crowd; people who are older have been to a lot more gigs than the kids; they've seen everything, so seeing them in the crowd means we've earned their applause.","I want to bring UCB to England. We don't have anything like it.","New York - it's the center of the world.","I don't understand how those old bands did it. We worked out early on that if we did three gigs in a row and went out afterwards, we'd lose our voices. We know our limits.","We like being English, but we're not that patriotic.","I regret a couple of wardrobe decisions.","I cut off my dreadlocks, but I couldn't face throwing them away. They were so hard to grow, man. There's a lot of work goes into those things. Some people keep a diary or a photo album to remind them of their past lives - well, I've got hair. Who knows? One day, maybe my grandchildren might want to see it.","We called ourselves Mumford & Sons because we liked the idea of an old-fashioned, family-owned store.","2014 was a pretty bad year for me. Quite a lot of loss.","Do you know what the key to comedy is? Timing.","You write in songs what you're too scared to write in real life, and then you sing the songs to loads of people instead of telling it to the person you should be telling it to... Songs are a great way of dealing with those issues but kind of a coward's way as well.","Once you're out there in front of people, I don't think there's any choice than to just give it your all.","The day we struggle to enjoy what we do and just get the gig over with we'll quit.","Somebody told me about a band that works out their whole set as if it was one song. They learn the whole set as one piece, so they know how the dynamics of it work. It's really difficult to do, and you can only really do it while you're on tour, as being in a rehearsal studio is not the same as being on stage in front of an audience.","I play banjo, and in Britain, it's easy to get away with playing banjo because you don't often see it on U.K. stages. In America, people know when you're a good banjo player, so I was really nervous about playing out there. But we actually went down really well.","We're not all Christian, so we can't be a Christian band.","England's just very cynical. Like I am. Like we all are.","I think we're all guilty of it as British citizens: if something gets big, we go, 'Ugh.'","Irish people never think we're Irish. Americans think we're European or French.","We know what we like in music, and we got into music to try and give back what we got out of it.","It must be tiring being Bob Dylan for the past 50 years. People act like he's not even human, which must be hard work. Every room he walks into just goes quiet.","Some people like the same thing forever, but I don't know. We kind of, like, listen to loads of different stuff, and our attention spans aren't good enough. So there was a bit of frustration when you're, like, having to play the same thing all the time because we play all, like, loads of different instruments.","We don't want to be part of some Tidal 'streaming revolution,' nor do we want to be Taylor Swift and be anti-it.","We look at our albums as stand-alone pieces of art and also as adverts for our live shows.","This is how people are going to listen to music now - streaming. So diversify as a band. It doesn't mean selling your songs to adverts.","Simian Mobile Disco changed my life. They put me onto the EDM world. Although they would hate that term, they're more techno.","I became obsessed with Simian Mobile Disco's music and poorly attempted to make my own techno music."],"Winter Ave Zoli":["It turns out nudity is not a problem for me. It's one of those things you think about later and say, 'Yeah, I could do this for a living.'","I spend as much time as possible at my stable in the Hollywood Hills. It keeps me sane."],"Winthrop Rockefeller":["Today is a great day, not only of healing and reconciliation, but also coming together. I'm so glad the whole Little Rock Nine was alive and here to see this.","I have enjoyed the personal use of money; but I have gotten the greatest satisfaction from using it to advance my beliefs in human relations, human values.","I yearn to see other chief executives throughout the nation follow suit, so that as a people we may hasten the elimination of barbarism as a tool of American justice."],"Wislawa Szymborska":["Life lasts but a few scratches of the claw in the sand.","All imperfection is easier to tolerate if served up in small doses.","Keep up the good work, if only for a while, if only for the twinkling of a tiny galaxy.","Each of us has a very rich nature and can look at things objectively, from a distance, and at the same time can have something more personal to say about them. I am trying to look at the world, and at myself, from many different points of view. I think many poets have this duality.","This terrifying world is not devoid of charms, of the mornings that make waking up worthwhile.","Someone sits at a table or lies on a sofa while staring motionless at a wall or ceiling. Once in a while this person writes down seven lines, only to cross out one of them 15 minutes later, and then another hour passes, during which nothing happens. Who could stand to watch this kind of thing?","Let the people who never find true love keep saying that there's no such thing. Their faith will make it easier for them to live and die.","I cannot imagine any writer who would not fight for his peace and quiet.","Nothing can ever happen twice. In consequence, the sorry fact is that we arrive here improvised and leave without the chance to practice.","You can find the entire cosmos lurking in its least remarkable objects.","I slide my arm from under the sleeper's head and it is numb, full of swarming pins, on the tip of each, waiting to be counted, the fallen angels sit.","At the very beginning of my creative life I loved humanity. I wanted to do something good for mankind. Soon I understood that it isn't possible to save mankind.","I like being near the top of a mountain. One can't get lost here.","After every war someone has to tidy up.","Get to know other worlds, if only for comparison. I am near, too near for him to dream of me.","Every beginning is only a sequel, after all, and the book of events is always open halfway through.","You know, I'm worried about Szymborska. I wish she would stop smoking.","Solitude is very important in my work as a mode of inspiration, but isolation is not good in this respect. I am not writing poetry about isolation.","Sometimes I write quickly, sometimes I spend several weeks on a single poem. I would really love for readers not to be able to guess which of the poems took so much work!","Take it not amiss, O speech, that I borrow weighty words, and later try hard to make them seem light.","Even the worst book can give us something to think about.","It's just not easy to explain to someone else what you don't understand yourself.","Any knowledge that doesn't lead to new questions quickly dies out: it fails to maintain the temperature required for sustaining life.","I'm fighting against the bad poet who is prone to using too many words.","In the language of poetry, where every word is weighed, nothing is usual or normal. Not a single stone and not a single cloud above it. Not a single day and not a single night after it. And above all, not a single existence, not anyone's existence in this world.","Somewhere out there the world must have an end.","Though I may deny poets their monopoly on inspiration, I still place them in a select group of Fortune's darlings.","I cannot speak for more than an hour exclusively about poetry. At that point, life itself takes over again.","In every tragedy, an element of comedy is preserved. Comedy is just tragedy reversed.","Poets yearn, of course, to be published, read, and understood, but they do little, if anything, to set themselves above the common herd and the daily grind.","Generally speaking, life is so rich and full of variety; you have to remember all the time that there is a comical side to everything.","There's simply too much fuss about myself.","Everyone needs solitude, especially a person who is used to thinking about what she experiences. Solitude is very important in my work as a mode of inspiration, but isolation is not good in this respect. I am not writing poetry about isolation.","I don't believe I have a mission. Sometimes I really have a spiritual need to say something more general about the world, and sometimes something personal.","Unfortunately, poetry is not born in noise, in crowds, or on a bus. There have to be four walls and the certainty that the telephone will not ring. That's what writing is all about.","I usually write for the individual reader -though I would like to have many such readers. There are some poets who write for people assembled in big rooms, so they can live through something collectively. I prefer my reader to take my poem and have a one-on-one relationship with it.","You have to remember all the time that there is a comical side to everything.","I've reached the age of self-knowledge, so I don't know anything. People who claim that they know something are responsible for most of the fuss in the world.","Sometimes I really have a spiritual need to say something more general about the world, and sometimes something personal.","All is mine but nothing owned, nothing owned for memory, and mine only while I look.","All the best have something in common, a regard for reality, an agreement to its primacy over the imagination.","I have sympathy for young people, for their growing pains, but I balk when these growing pains are pushed into the foreground, when you make these young people the only vehicles of life's wisdom.","I started earning a living as a poet rather early on.","I'm drowning in papers.","Is a decision made in advance really any kind of choice.","Poetic talent doesn't operate in a vacuum. There is a spirit of Polish poetry.","When I was young I had a moment of believing in the Communist doctrine. I wanted to save the world through Communism. Quite soon I understood that it doesn't work, but I've never pretended it didn't happen to me.","'There's nothing new under the sun': that's what you wrote, Ecclesiastes. But you yourself were born new under the sun."],"Wissam Al Mana":["Time is like a very good friend who you don't see very often.","You can ask me anything you want; I'm very opinionated... except about my private life. I don't want to talk about that.","I don't have Facebook; I don't have Twitter. I don't have anything because, believe it or not, I'm a very, very private person! I don't even have WhatsApp! I don't like to pry into people's business.","I spend time with my wife. It's a luxury. We love travelling... we love going to nice, exotic places far away from the world and from prying eyes."],"Withered Hand":["My favourite place is at home with my family. My career is really raising my children. I'm still waiting for clarity on the future.","When I became a parent and hit my thirties, I got my hands on an acoustic guitar. I started writing quiet, simple songs at home and, with a little encouragement, I got more courage and found my voice. I have people and movements who have inspired me to carry on, but I try to write about things I know, nothing too complicated, really.","Although I didn't set out to run my own label, I found it made sense quite quickly. I can say what I want and dance to my own tune, even if sometimes it's like nobody is listening. The trade-off is you stay 'cult' and resign yourself to a very modest level of what most people would call success.","I had a kind of artrock band called Peanut for a while, which eventually helped me over my fear of singing. That was a big step for me. I never dreamed I could sing songs in front of people.","I can get a tune out of most things with strings, but I'm not really sure I'm what could be called a musician. I find it fascinating working with people who can play other instruments and sing.","I think the last album I bought was a very beautiful album called 'Lost Wisdom' by Mount Eerie featuring Julie Doiron, and I bought it direct from Phil Elverum via his website. It's cool you can do that now with the Internet.","I grew up listening to Teenage Fanclub and Eugenius. Scottish music cast a huge influence on me.","I have to have some kind of creative outlet; otherwise, I'm hell to be around.","I would describe my songs as just a collection of my thoughts, with melodies that probably occurred to me in the grocery store or cycling home, sung as best I can over a bunch of chords."],"Witold Gombrowicz":["You are ugly when you love her, you are beautiful and fresh, vital and free, modern and poetic when you don't... you are more beautiful as an orphan than as your mother's son.","I didn't go to the lectures. My valet, who was more distinguished than I, went instead."],"Witold Pilecki":["During the first 3 years at Auschwitz, 2 million people died; over the next 2 years - 3 million.","So they didn't let anybody else off. I can't live like this, I'm finished. Auschwitz was easy.","I carried out my orders until arrested. I had no sense that I was spying, and I ask that this be taken into account in deciding my verdict."],"Wiz Khalifa":["My live performance, it just comes from feeling an energy and emotion from the crowd.","The most daring thing is to be yourself and to do exactly what you want to do at that point in time and not to be worried with what other people are doing or what's popular.","Whatever I do, I do it because I want to do it and because it's completely, 100% me.","I groom, but it doesn't take me a long time to get to what people see.","Every day is new. It's just a new day. I look at six hours at a time.","You don't have to be a certain thing to be cool. If you're white, you don't have to act black or whatever. Just be you and know who you are.","I have an idea of who I want to be, I have a vision of my own success.","I critique myself way harder than anybody else could critique me.","Even with whatever people want to label me with, there are so many other sides to me.","I love tattoos.","I've been pretty focused my entire life, and now that I have a family, I'm just going to keep that focus, but it's going to be a family focus.","I've done a lot of work to get where I'm at, but I have to keep working.","I don't have problems with people, because if I do, I address it.","I'm always hustling.","I love my wife. We FaceTime and we talk on the phone and she travels to come see me when she can. But she works as well. But we see each other a lot more than people would think, though, because we make it happen and we love each other so much.","Since I was younger I've been making the best out of nothing.","I never want to confuse people or go over their heads.","I see myself as like the lead singer of a band or something.","My dad has been a big influence on me, because he's always had his own business. He really taught me business sense and how to be a focused individual, but also how to have fun and make everyone around you have fun.","Yeah, baggy jeans are done. Nobody wants to wear big, baggy jeans. Baggy jeans are completely over with.","When you're from the East Coast or you're from the South, people expect you to sound a certain way. So if you don't sound that way, people won't label you as that type of artist. For me, I had a whole new lane to create for myself being from Pittsburgh and being a Midwest artist.","The name 'Wiz' comes from me being the youngest dude in my age group of people that I hung out with. I was pretty good at anything I tried to do, so they would call me a young wiz.","'Khalifa' is Arabic, it means successor, leader, shining light. My granddad is Muslim and he gave me that name.","I think hip-hop is really fun right now... and that's why people are using dance beats and singing more.","I never got nervous performing my own material.","I always envisioned myself being a rapper and being in the game and having success, but you never know what it feels like or how you're going to be when you're there.","I started writing songs when I was eight.","I sleep on my stomach with my head under a bunch of pillows so if someone wants to come in and try to kill me they can't tell if I'm there or not, so they'll just leave.","I don't consider myself an A-list celebrity or a big dog, but every time I meet somebody, even rappers who've been in the game for years... they're like, 'Man, I'm trying to get on your level.'","Just growing up in Pittsburgh and knowing different neighborhoods, having family there and just loving it, it's like no other place.","I have a huge span of fans, some who know all my radio songs and are familiar with my popular stuff and then some who have their own personal favorites. When I do my show, I try to take into consideration all those people.","I think wherever you go, when people hear good music, they will react to it.","I don't take time off.","People connect with me just as a cool, around-the-way type of guy.","Every artist picks what they want to put out there, what image they want to portray, and what they want people to know about where they're from.","Brand names aren't important to me at all.","I like a lot of old-school R&B, soul, and classic rock.","I made my first mix tape when I was 14.","There's people who I admire like... Dr. Dre, Puff Daddy, Master P, people who built their stuff and are still going.","My music and my fan base is really built off of my lifestyle.","Philly is more East Coast than Pittsburgh. It's closer to New Jersey and New York, so the vibe is way more fast-paced.","I want to be an icon.","I never write from concept. The beat is the beginning, and then I fill in the rest of the song into what it should be."],"WizKid":["I'm thankful because all the hard work and sacrifices were worth it in the end.","It's not like a boss and artist relationship; it's like a big brother to a younger brother relationship, and he's a great guy. So big shout-out to Akon and the Konvict Muzik crowd.","I always dreamed of making it big.","When I'm back home, all I wear is African fabric. All I really rock is the traditional stuff.","I have a lot of tailors. If I want something made in 12 hours, it will be made in 12 hours.","I didn't have accessories when I started my career. Did you see me wearing bling-bling when I did 'Hola at Your Boi?' No! I hustled to get money to buy them, and there is no crime if I show it or flaunt it to my fans because they gave me money to buy them.","Lagos style is fresh and different. Even with the tailors, they get very innovative with their stuff, with the cuts. When my parents used to make the traditional wares, it was a little bit baggy. But now the tailors are able to infuse the European style, making it slim-fit. Lagos style is different, man. Innovative.","If you're coming to do an interview with me, you should know about me. It's not that it's 'cos I'm Wizkid; I'd even hate it if you were coming to interview my friend and asked him the same question. You're here for an interview, so you should know who you're doing the interview with.","We still have a lot of work to do as African artists to get more recognition in the U.K. and the U.S., but right now, definitely, we're getting the recognition. The thing is we have to earn it. Keep working. Stay working.","I knew 'Ojuelegba' was a good song, but I didn't expect it to blow up the way that it did.","I like me some Bape, you know. But I wear anything, to be honest. Adyn, Rick Owens, Givenchy, anything. I shop from everywhere.","Umm... my favourite Wizkid tune of all time would be 'Don't Dull' 'cos I recorded the track in, like, 5 minutes. The beat was ready, we went into the studio and freestyled, and it was ready. The song became really, really big, so I think 'Don't Dull' is still my favourite.","Whenever I make music, I just make it depending on however I feel at that moment and what I'm getting inspiration from, so it depends - whatever, it's just my mood.","Whatever happens on tour... stays on tour!","No, fame has not changed Wizkid.","The only thing fame has changed in Wizkid is that I added some accessories. I have got nice chains, watches, and nice clothes. Asides that, I am still Wizkid. I no tall, still same height.","I'm getting in the studio with everybody I've always wanted to work with. That's the amazing thing.","Music is everything to me, and I'm most grateful that it's all working out.","I'm still trying to keep it original, staying true to my sound.","It's crazy how a whole lot of African artists work. Big respect to everyone that does it, but I have not heard anything that really cuts across. We're trying to do that."],"Wladimir Klitschko":["Mental strength is really important because you either win or lose in your mind. And I'm not solely talking about sporting matches, boxing events - anything you do, you do it first with your mental strength. And you can actually train and develop it, and I am responsible for what I'm saying because I have experience with that.","All the champions - you go and ask Mike Tyson or Joe Louis, Rocky Marciano, Lennox Lewis and myself included, and I'm sorry for putting myself in line with all the other great names - but the champion's attitude is it doesn't matter who is in front of me, I am going to conquer this person and win the fight and knock the person out.","I have a Ph.D. in philosophy and sports science. At 14, I went through this really tough Soviet training system. A lot of my roommates got psychologically broken or physically injured. Either you came through, or you were out. I made my Ph.D. work in the field of young athletes aged 14-19 because at this age any human is changing.","Politics is comparable to boxing. The only thing is that in politics there are basically no rules. In boxing, you can get a black eye, but in politics you can get poison in your food or a bullet in the head. It's definitely rougher and tougher than other sports.","I think a fight with David Haye, even if he is not American, is going to give positive vibes about the heavyweight division for the American fans and fans worldwide.","If I am 100% prepared for the fight, my opponent has no chance to win the fight. I am saying what I mean: He has a 0% chance to win the fight. There is going to be no luck involved; there is going to be nothing else to stop me from winning the fight.","I've been many times to Dubai and the U.A.E., and I have friends that live there. It would be exciting to stage world heavyweight championship fights in the Arab world. It's something Muhammad Ali achieved when he fought in Zaire or the Philippines. It's absolutely exciting to fight in countries where you have never fought.","In the old days, when Muhammad Ali was fighting Ken Norton, Joe Frazier and George Foreman, there was a lot of excitement in the heavyweight division, I have to admit it.","I run, but boxing conditioning is different, so you have to get used to running in the ring. Boxing movements are very different. Swimming is one of the best because every single muscle is working. I swim a lot. I train very hard at things that mimic boxing. I have to do mostly sport-specific training, such as lots of sparring.","You can train your mental strength just like you train your body. If your body looks fit or ripped, it looks strong, and you can flex your muscles. So, physically, you have a certain strength. Mentally, it's the same thing. You can train your psychological strength.","You lose or you win the fight - and anything in life - in your mind. I can look at how the person walks, how he speaks, his expressions. It's a wisdom. Eyes are the mirror of the soul. So you can read a lot.","The reality of growing up is we changed schools so many times, my brother was my best friend. We have a five-year age gap, and my brother inspired me. He started boxing, and I just want to show that I could do things better than him.","I'm playing right now a role, and the role is called the 'Heavyweight Champion of the World.' And it takes all of the time. And I love this role, and it takes a lot of attention for me for the sport, and I just don't want to lose the title, so that's why I have to stay focused and not become an actor.","I never fought in my life outside of a ring.","All of my fights are planned. I study my opponents from A to Z. How he walks, how he looks, how he speaks, gestures of the human body, which is a certain language that provides you lots of information if you have the ability to read it. You just need to pay attention to it and gain experience over the years.","I would say that Roger Federer is pretty amazing. And Manny Pacquiao - he's such a tiny, little lightweight guy, but the way he fights makes people so excited.","I know he's retired, but I'm a big fan of Shaquille O'Neal, his game and his personality. I have a pair of his shoes in my office. You see the size of his shoe and think, 'This is not real, this couldn't belong to a human being.' But he is human!","Radiation doesn't recognize borders. A meltdown in Japan or India, say, is a danger to the whole world. Wind circulates the radiation everywhere. Water quality is affected. We all eat the same fish. We use products from all over the world - if something is contaminated, it will cause harm.","After Chernobyl, thousands and thousands of people, if not millions, were given a death penalty and had to pay the price, our father among them.","In Soviet times, the border was closed, so we couldn't get out of the country, and I had been reading Robinson Crusoe. I wanted to see the ocean, I wanted to see boats, I wanted to see black people, because we didn't have that in the Soviet Union. I was all excited by that stuff.","The first thing I learned in boxing is to not get hit. That's the art of boxing. Execute your opponent without getting hit. In sports school, we were putting our hands behind our backs and having to defend ourselves with our shoulders, by rolling, by moving round the ring, moving out feet.","I train six days a week for four to five hours a day. I like to keep the same schedule when I'm in camp for every fight.","It's not my place to compare myself to greats like Tyson, Frazier or men like that. But I would look at a fighter like Evander Holyfield. He's a great heavyweight who worked his way up through the weight classes to become champion and had to beat bigger men along the way.","These nuclear plants are more dangerous than people realize.","I think we have tremendous media covering the sport of boxing, even if boxing is a little bit lost in popularity with MMA sports. And I think that with the show 'Lights Out' it's going to get more attention to the sport, and it's going to put more attention to the problems that athletes in general have.","It is up to the people and boxing fans to give me the respect I deserve once I have finished my career. I personally do not think about my legacy.","I always train and prepare with highest concentration and focus on my next opponent. To me, it does not matter what his name is.","Only younger brothers will understand me. We're following in the footsteps of older brothers. You are looking up to your brother. You want to do the same things. You want to do as good as he and do it even better.","I'm trying to keep the face of my opponent more or less not damaged but eventually to execute the plan and knock him out.","I have decided to make a personal message to David Haye. I want him to fight me, to be a man. I wish there will be enough excitement, pressure and courage for David Haye to fight me.","I respect the IBF obligation to fight Povetkin, but I would like the exception to fight David Haye. That is the only title the Klitschkos don't have. We have them all except the WBA, which is why Haye is such an interesting cookie for me to eat.","I've fought everybody without ducking anyone. I have beaten 10 undefeated guys, and I never was comparing myself to the greatest in the sport. I was not thinking of breaking any records. I'm just enjoying my time in boxing.","I learned in my Ph.D. the discipline I needed to be successful. Most boxers are not that disciplined. They have talent, but the self-organization - the ability to schedule yourself and your priorities - is lacking. My studies were about the control of training on both the psychological and the physical side.","My goal is not getting hit and to knock the other guy out. Some people might complain because they want to see boxers beat up on each other, but you cannot last long in professional boxing if you take a lot of punches."],"Wladyslaw Reymont":["When I was six and already able to read and write Polish, my uncle the curate taught me Latin. Since he had no suitable textbook, he simply used the breviary.","My father was the church organist; the village curate was my mother's brother, a former monk from the order of Pijar, a very well-educated and ascetic man who loved nothing but solitude.","During my childhood, I had a long, dangerous spell of illness, and my health has always been delicate.","By the age of nine, I had a thorough knowledge of contemporary Polish literature as well as of foreign literature in Polish translation, and I began to write poems in honour of a lady of thirty years. Naturally, she knew nothing about them."],"Wojciech Jaruzelski":["There were three causes that accounted for the proclamation of martial law in Poland. First it was the progressing economic ruin of the country. Second, it was the decomposition of the functioning of the state. And third, a threat of a civil war.","Thank goodness we don't live in medieval times, when people fought wars over ideas.","I served the Poland that existed.","I exist only in the past.","It was not that socialism failed, it was the lack of socialism.","America is so large and so diverse that it is overwhelming, but my first impressions are favorable.","Socialism as such from its very origins is a workers' system, and when there occur deviations, it is workers that react first.","I do not have to look for credentials for my Polishness and for my patriotism. I'm a Pole. The chronicles of my family go back - as far back as the 13th century."],"Wolcott Gibbs":["Backward ran sentences until reeled the mind.","Where it all will end, knows God.","Our writers are full of cliches just as old barns are full of bats. There is obviously no rule about this, except that anything that you suspect of being a cliche undoubtedly is one and had better be removed."],"Wole Soyinka":["Each time I think I've created time for myself, along comes a throwback to disrupt my private space.","A tiger does not shout its tigritude, it acts.","Human life has meaning only to that degree and as long as it is lived in the service of humanity.","Given the scale of trauma caused by the genocide, Rwanda has indicated that however thin the hope of a community can be, a hero always emerges. Although no one can dare claim that it is now a perfect state, and that no more work is needed, Rwanda has risen from the ashes as a model or truth and reconciliation.","I have a kind of magnetic attraction to situations of violence.","Rwanda, which is one of the younger independent states in Africa, must be regarded as a model of how great human trauma can be transformed to commence true reconstruction of people. Human trauma can lead to stunted growth and mass withdrawal.","There is only one home to the life of a river-mussel; there is only one home to the life of a tortoise; there is only one shell to the soul of man: there is only one world to the spirit of our race. If that world leaves its course and smashes on boulders of the great void, whose world will give us shelter?","One's own self-worth is tied to the worth of the community to which one belongs, which is intimately connected to humanity in general. What happens in Darfur becomes an assault on my own community, and on me as an individual. That's what the human family is all about.","And I believe that the best learning process of any kind of craft is just to look at the work of others.","I am a glutton for tranquility.","I like my peace and quiet whenever I can grab it.","You cannot live a normal existence if you haven't taken care of a problem that affects your life and affects the lives of others, values that you hold which in fact define your very existence.","Art is solace; art is vision, and when I pick up a literary work, I am a consumer of literature for its own sake.","After the death of the sadistic dictator Gen. Sanni Abacha in 1998, Nigeria underwent a one-year transitional military administration headed by Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar, who uncharacteristically bowed out precisely on the promised date for military disengagement. Did the military truly disengage, however? No.","African film makers are scraping by on a mere pittance.","Under a dictatorship, a nation ceases to exist. All that remains is a fiefdom, a planet of slaves regimented by aliens from outer space.","I am convinced that Nigeria would have been a more highly developed country without the oil. I wished we'd never smelled the fumes of petroleum.","Power is domination, control, and therefore a very selective form of truth which is a lie.","The phenomenon of creativity, we know, is closely related to the ability to yoke together separate, and even seemingly incompatible, matrices.","We live in a materialist world, and materialism appeals so strongly to humanity, no matter where.","The man dies in all who keep silent in the face of tyranny.","No human is completely fearless.","The hand that dips into the bottom of the pot will eat the biggest snail.","Education is lacking in most of those who pontificate.","Nigeria has had the misfortune - no, the fortune - of seeing the worst face of capitalism anywhere in Africa. The masses have seen it, they are disgusted, and they want an alternative.","I don't really consider myself a novelist, it just came out purely by accident.","The scales of reckoning with mortality are never evenly weighted, alas, and thus it is on the shoulders of the living that the burden of justice must continue to rest.","I began writing early - very, very early... I was already writing short stories for the radio and selling poems to poetry and art festivals; I was involved in school plays; I wrote essays, so there was no definite moment when I said, 'Now I'm a writer.' I've always been a writer.","Probably to me the greatest singer, female voice, is Billie Holiday. And one of the most moving for me, I don't know why - maybe it's nostalgia, maybe because my life is one of constant partying, whatever.","Books and all forms of writing have always been objects of terror to those who seek to suppress the truth.","The blatant aggressiveness of theocracies I find distressing, because I grew up when Christians, Muslim and animists lived peacefully together.","I found, when I left, that there were others who felt the same way. We'd meet, they'd come and seek me out, we'd talk about the future. And I found that their depression and pessimism was every bit as acute as mine.","Just like birds, hunters know no borders.","The writer is the visionary of his people... He anticipates, he warns.","Looking at faces of people, one gets the feeling there's a lot of work to be done.","Being the first black Nobel laureate, and the first African, the African world considered me personal property. I lost the remaining shreds of my anonymity, even to walk a few yards in London, Paris or Frankfurt without being stopped.","I take friendship very seriously.","One has a responsibility to clean up one's space and make it livable as far as one's own resources go. That includes not only material resources, but psychological resources: the commitment of time and a portion of your mind to something when you'd rather be doing something else.","My horizon on humanity is enlarged by reading the writers of poems, seeing a painting, listening to some music, some opera, which has nothing at all to do with a volatile human condition or struggle or whatever. It enriches me as a human being.","For me, justice is the prime condition of humanity.","I'm not sure I'm trying to communicate a message. I'm just trying to be part of the movement away from the unacceptable present.","I grew up in an atmosphere where words were an integral part of culture.","There are different kinds of artists and very often, I'll be very frank with you, I wish I were a different kind.","The greatest threat to freedom is the absence of criticism.","In Africa, those who have money - businessmen and banks - do not believe in film.","See, even despite pious statements to the contrary, much of the industrialized world has not yet come to terms with the recognition of the fallacy of what I call the strong man syndrome.","You always assume for some strange reason that you need three meals a day.","History teaches us to beware of the excitation of the liberated and the injustices that often accompany their righteous thirst for justice.","There is not a special imposition on writers to be activists. All that does is encourage writers to write propaganda. Propaganda can be written by anybody, including dictators.","There's no way to escape the culture that has evolved, from which we ourselves have evolved. Naturally, we stress it, break it up, reassemble it to suit our own needs. But it is there - a source of vital strength.","And gradually they're beginning to recognize the fact that there's nothing more secure than a democratic, accountable, and participatory form of government. But it's sunk in only theoretically, it has not yet sunk in completely in practical terms.","But the ultimate lesson is just sit down and write. That's all.","But theater, because of its nature, both text, images, multimedia effects, has a wider base of communication with an audience. That's why I call it the most social of the various art forms.","But when you're deprived of it for a lengthy period then you value human companionship. But you have to survive and so you devise all kinds of mental exercises and it's amazing.","Even when I'm writing plays I enjoy having company and mentally I think of that company as the company I'm writing for.","I consider the process of gestation just as important as when you're actually sitting down putting words to the paper.","I think that feeling that if one believed absolutely in any cause, then one must have the confidence, the self-certainty, to go through with that particular course of action.","I'm not one of those writers I learned about who get up in the morning, put a piece of paper in their typewriter machine and start writing. That I've never understood.","One thing I can tell you is this, that I am not a methodical writer.","One, a mass movement from within, which, as you know, is constantly being put down brutally but which, again, regroups and moves forward as is happening right now as we are speaking.","The novel, for me, was an accident. I really don't consider myself a novelist.","There's a kind of dynamic quality about theater and that dynamic quality expresses itself in relation to, first of all, the environment in which it's being staged; then the audience, the nature of the audience, the quality of the audience.","There's something about the theater which makes my fingertips tingle.","Very conscious of the fact that an effort was being made to destroy my mind, because I was deprived of books, deprived of any means of writing, deprived of human companionship. You never know how much you need it until you're deprived of it.","Well, first of all I'll say that I come alive best in theater.","Well, the first thing is that truth and power for me form an antithesis, an antagonism, which will hardly ever be resolved. I can define in fact, can simplify the history of human society, the evolution of human society, as a contest between power and freedom.","Books and all forms of writing are terror to those who wish to suppress the truth.","I ceased using words like optimism and pessimism a long time ago.","If African film makers had one-tenth the amount commanded by film makers the world over - even the amount used by so-called shoestring film makers - I think we would see quite an explosion of African films on the world scene.","A war, with its attendant human suffering, must, when that evil is unavoidable, be made to fragment more than buildings: It must shatter the foundations of thought and re-create. Only in this way does every individual share in the cataclysm and understand the purpose of sacrifice.","The Nation of Islam provides an antidote in the United States to fundamentalist Islam - which is why individuals from America have to go abroad to find radical teachings.","England is the breeding ground of fundamentalist Muslims. Its social logic is to allow all religions to preach openly. But this is illogic, because none of the other religions preach apocalyptic violence. And yet England allows it.","Colonialism bred an innate arrogance, but when you undertake that sort of imperial adventure, that arrogance gives way to a feeling of accommodativeness. You take pride in your openness.","We Nigerians must reclaim our sovereignty, our civic entitlements.","I cannot belong to a nation which permits such barbarities as stoning to death and amputation - I don't care what religion it is.","I like to say, 'I spend one-third of my time in Nigeria, one-third in Europe or America, and one-third on a plane.'","Seven is the magic figure, because that's a symbolic figure of my favorite deity, Ogun.","When I write plays, I'm already seeing the shapes on stage, of the actors and their interaction, and so on and so forth. I don't think I've ever written one play as an abstract piece, as a literary piece, floating in the air somewhere, to be flushed out later on.","Before you're a writer, you're a citizen, a human being, and therefore the weapons of the citizen are at your disposal to use or not use.","I've always written plays for the purpose of getting something out of my system.","One has to confront history honestly.","I'm not fond of biographies. I don't like writing about myself.","An idyllic period of my existence was when I had a den attached to my home... a writing den, and no one had access to that unless they had their own special visa, applied for weeks in advance.","I don't have the sort of temperament that submits to Christianity or Islam.","Some people think the Nobel Prize makes you bullet-proof. I never had that illusion.","I don't know any other way to live but to wake up every day armed with my convictions, not yielding them to the threat of danger and to the power and force of people who might despise me.","An excessive amount of my time is taken with political involvement. It's unavoidable; that's my temperament.","In the world of literature, I see prizes as more of a duty to the craft itself, rather than as something for the individual.","I've done a lot of guerrilla theater in my time.","You go to conferences, and your fellow African intellectuals - and even heads of state - they all say: 'Nigeria is a big disappointment. It is the shame of the African continent.'","The Lagos of my childhood was a well-laid-out maritime city.","Some African leaders actually dare to suggest that democracy is a concept alien to traditional African society. This is one of the most impudent political blasphemies I can think of.","Some of the greatest uprisings and consequent civil wars in Mexico have centered squarely on the ownership of land.","Writers and intellectuals have a duty to humanity. It is to insist that the human entity remains the primary asset in overall development; thus, it must be safeguarded.","No writer has a right to make that much money. Indeed, without diabolical assistance, no writer can.","Politics, I believe, is a full-time occupation.","My father was a schoolteacher, and so I had the advantage of both western educational instruction in the school, as well as what you might call the process of imbibing the traditional processes of education instruction around me.","The problem with literature, with writing, is that it works sometimes in terms of correction of social ills. Other times, it just does not suffice.","My understanding of the creative process is simply that all cultures and all concerns meet at a certain point, the human point in which everything is related to one another. That has been my creative experience. I never know who's influencing me at any time.","I love beauty. But I like the beauty accidentally, not dished up, served up on a platter.","Military dictatorship, you can focus on it, you can fight it directly. It's a band of power-driven people.","Writing in certain environments carries with it an occupational risk.","I'm an Afro-realist. I take what comes, and I do my best to affect what is unacceptable in society.","All religions accept that there is something called 'criminality.' And criminality cannot be excused by religious fervour.","Those nations that say it's a crime to preach your religion are making a terrible mistake. All they're doing is driving underground other forms of spiritual intuitions and practices.","Trading and religion have always been aligned together in the history of the world, and especially on the African continent.","The Sudanese government has been playing games with the world, with the Africa Union, in particular, have been playing for time in order to conclude its mission of ethnic cleansing in the Sudan.","There is something really horrific for any human being who feels he is being consumed by other people. I'm talking about a writer's critics, who don't address what you've written, but want to probe into your existence and magnify the trivia of your life without any sense of humor, without any sense of context."],"Wolf Blitzer":["We'll have to wait the old-fashioned way.","Looks like a pretty serious race unfolding.","My rule of thumb is that if I am interested or intrigued by something, others will be as well.","My best stories come from well-placed sources who point me in the right direction.","If you are a reliable, honest journalist, sources will open up and trust you and share good information.","There are millions and millions of patriotic Muslim Americans.","I have a few TVs.","My goal is to make the viewer a little bit smarter.","I love politics.","I eat right. I exercise. I run 5 miles a day on the treadmill.","My inclination, as an old-school, classically trained journalist, is not to go with a story unless I have it hard. It's not good enough to say something based on rumors that were flying around.","Two hours on television just doesn't automatically happen. I'm up early, I'm reading newspapers online, talking to my staff, coming up with ideas.","I'm a season ticket holder to the Washington Wizards, and I love going to Washington Nationals and Redskins games.","Almost every day I wrap up my two-hour live broadcast and I say to myself as I'm driving home, 'I wish I would've done this' or 'We really should have gone live longer with this segment.'","When I finished grad school, I sort of fell into journalism. Someone mentioned that there was an entry-level job at the Reuters News Agency. I applied, and, to my amazement, I got the job.","I love covering stories that have huge historic impacts.","I tend to overwrite; I need a good editor."],"Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart":["I pay no attention whatever to anybody's praise or blame. I simply follow my own feelings.","Neither a lofty degree of intelligence nor imagination nor both together go to the making of genius. Love, love, love, that is the soul of genius.","I cannot write poetically, for I am no poet. I cannot make fine artistic phrases that cast light and shadow, for I am no painter. I can neither by signs nor by pantomime express my thoughts and feelings, for I am no dancer; but I can by tones, for I am a musician.","We live in this world in order always to learn industriously and to enlighten each other by means of discussion and to strive vigorously to promote the progress of science and the fine arts.","I am one of those who will go on doing till all doings are at an end.","When I am traveling in a carriage, or walking after a good meal, or during the night when I cannot sleep; it is on such occasions that ideas flow best and most abundantly.","Believe me, I do not like idleness but work.","I thank my God for graciously granting me the opportunity of learning that death is the key which unlocks the door to our true happiness.","It is a great consolation for me to remember that the Lord, to whom I had drawn near in humble and child-like faith, has suffered and died for me, and that He will look on me in love and compassion.","Just as people behave to me, so do I behave to them. When I see that a person despises me and treats me with contempt, I can be as proud as any peacock.","Versification is, indeed, indispensable for music, but rhyme, solely for rhyming's sake, most pernicious.","An unmarried man, in my opinion, enjoys only half a life.","I live in a country where music has very little success, though, exclusive of those who have forsaken us, we have still admirable professors and, more particularly, composers of great solidity, knowledge, and taste.","If I were obliged to marry all those with whom I have jested, I should have at least two hundred wives.","How sad it is that these great gentlemen should believe what anyone tells them and do not choose to judge for themselves! But it is always so.","Nevertheless the passions, whether violent or not, should never be so expressed as to reach the point of causing disgust; and music, even in situations of the greatest horror, should never be painful to the ear but should flatter and charm it, and thereby always remain music.","The happy medium - truth in all things - is no longer either known or valued; to gain applause, one must write things so inane that they might be played on barrel-organs, or so unintelligible that no rational being can comprehend them, though on that very account, they are likely to please.","As for pupils, I can have as many as I choose, but I do not choose to take many. I intend to be better paid than others, and so I wish to have fewer scholars. It is advisable to hang back a little at first, or it is all over with you, and you must pursue the common highway with the rest.","I know nothing new except that Herr Gellert, the Leipzig poet, is dead, and has written no more poetry since his death.","I hope never to marry in this way; I wish to make my wife happy, but not to become rich by her means, so I will let things alone and enjoy my golden freedom till I am so well off that I can support both wife and children.","My father is maestro at the Metropolitan church, which gives me an opportunity to write for the church as much as I please.","My sole recreations consist in dancing English hornpipes and cutting capers. Italy is a land of sleep; I am always drowsy here.","When I come to reflect on the subject, in no country have I received such honors or been so esteemed as in Italy, and nothing contributes more to a man's fame than to have written Italian operas, and especially for Naples.","One must not make oneself cheap here - that is a cardinal point - or else one is done. Whoever is most impertinent has the best chance.","My Constanze is the virtuous, honourable, discreet, and faithful darling of her honest and kindly-disposed Mozart."],"Wolfgang Hildesheimer":["The revolutionary Mozart is the Mozart of his last eight years.","When I was five years old, my parents gave me a magic chest. I learned to cast spells, although of a childish kind, before I had learned to read and write.","I had given up magic, because it had reached a state of perfection. I felt that I was able to transform men into animals. I did not make use of this capability, because I believed I could not justify an intervention of this kind in the life of another person."],"Wolfgang Ketterle":["I think both running and science reflect certain character traits. I have endurance, patience, and ambition. I'm willing to work hard toward a goal, to push myself and overcome limits. Running and science both let me express these traits.","Amplifying atoms is more subtle than amplifying electromagnetic waves because atoms can only change their quantum state and cannot be created. Therefore, even if one could amplify gold atoms, one would not realize the dreams of medieval alchemy.","Bose-Einstein condensation is one of the most intriguing phenomena predicted by quantum statistical mechanics.","When I run, I think about everything: physics, family problems, plans for the weekend. I haven't made any big discoveries on a run, but it does give me time to think through problems. Some solutions are obvious, but they are only obvious when you are relaxed enough to find them.","My explorations of the technical world started with Legos, with which I was quite creative in constructing moving objects with the basic building blocks that were then available.","Explorations into chemistry were done in our basement, sometimes with friends, and my parents must have had quite a bit of confidence in my abilities when they allowed me to experiment with explosive mixtures.","When I was around thirty, I met my own personal challenge and finished a few marathons under three hours, and I have completed many long bicycle tours.","After earning my Ph.D., I stayed at the Max-Planck Institute as a postdoc, working on laser excitation of Rydberg states of triatomic hydrogen and helium hydride. I also succeeded in analyzing all the emission spectra of helium hydride, which I had discovered during my Ph.D.","Imagine how many aspects of nature we would miss if we lived on the surface of the sun. Without inventing refrigerators, we would only know gaseous matter and never observe liquids or solids, and miss the beauty of snowflakes.","Laser cooling opened a new route to ultralow temperature physics. Laser cooling experiments, with room temperature vacuum chambers and easy optical access, look very different from cryogenic cells with multi-layer thermal shielding around them.","When I was running the marathons in Munich, I always trained by myself. Between the demands of graduate work and a young family, I had to train at unusual hours. A few times, I ran home from my lab late at night, which was 20 kilometers out of town.","As a scientist, I play in the top league - the Olympics, the World Championships - and I want to be in the lead. As a runner, I set personal goals, and I want to push beyond my own personal limits. I was very happy when I practiced for several months and then reached my goal to run a marathon in 2:50.","Running is a way for me to relax. With one hour of intense running, I can get a lot of physical exercise. I can relax my body. I feel a tension in my muscles when I don't run. In that sense, I need to get out a few times a week in order to do my work as a scientist, which involves a lot of sitting still.","Maybe if you win a Nobel Prize in economics, you make a lot of money by giving talks... but not in my area.","I used the Nobel money to buy a house and for the education of my children.","When air is hot, the molecules move fast and they have high kinetic energy. The colder the molecules are, the smaller their velocities are and, subsequently, their energy. Temperature is simply a way to characterize the energy of a system.","Zero kelvin is the lowest possible temperature. At absolute zero, all motion comes to a standstill. It is obvious that a lower temperature is not feasible because there is no velocity smaller than zero and no energy content less than nothing.","Auto emission is hazardous and has to be controlled.","Bose and Einstein had triggered low-temperature experiments that have led to the discovery of new matter. I owe my work and my Nobel to them.","To go below one nanokelvin is like running a mile below four minutes for the first time."],"Wolfgang Paul":["I grew up in Muenchen where my father has been a professor for pharmaceutic chemistry at the university. He had studied chemistry and medicine, having been a research student in Leipzig with Wilhelm Ostwald, the Nobel Laureate 1909. So I became familiar with the life of a scientist in a chemical laboratory quite early.","I was born on August 10, 1913, in Lorenzkirch, a small village in Saxony, as the fourth child of Theodor and Elisabeth Paul, nee Ruppel. All in all, we were six children. Both parents were descendants from Lutheran ministers in several generations.","After finishing the gymnasium in Muenchen with 9 years of Latin and 6 years of ancient Greek, history and philosophy, I decided to become a physicist. The great theoretical physicist Arnold Sommerfeld, an university colleague of my late father, advised me to begin with an apprenticeship in precision mechanics.","In 1952, I was appointed Professor at the University of Bonn and Director of the Physics Institute, with very good students waiting for a thesis advisor."],"Wolfgang Petersen":["Theaters are always going to be around, and doing fine. With computers and technology, we're becoming more and more secluded from each other. And the movie theater is one of the last places where we can still gather and experience something together. I don't think the desire for that magic will ever go away.","Achilles was like a rock star of his day so it made sense to have Brad Pitt playing him.","We like Batman - we understand him, we suffer with him. On the other hand, we want to be Superman. But they're conflicting philosophies. Let's bring them together in one movie and see how we, as an audience, wrestle with our inner demons."],"Wolfgang Puck":["Cooking is like painting or writing a song. Just as there are only so many notes or colors, there are only so many flavors - it's how you combine them that sets you apart.","One thing I always say is being a great chef today is not enough - you have to be a great businessman.","A chef is a mixture maybe of artistry and craft. You have to learn the craft really to get there.","A good chef has to be a manager, a businessman and a great cook. To marry all three together is sometimes difficult.","Italian food is all about ingredients and it's not fussy and it's not fancy.","For me, cooking is an expression of the land where you are and the culture of that place.","For me, I don't expect to have a really amazing meal each time I dine out. Having a good meal with your loved ones - that's what makes the experience.","I like the Japanese knives, I like French knives. Whatever's sharp.","A lot of restaurants serve good food, but they don't have very good service.","If you're cooking for a woman, make a good risotto and a salad. If you don't have time to make desert you can go and buy some macaroons to have afterwards.","In L.A. you live in a big city, but you feel like you're in the countryside. For example, I can be at home in the swimming pool and be five minutes from everything.","You know, I never really thought of myself as a 'celebrity.' One of the titles that I like least is 'celebrity chef.'","What I don't like is breakfast in the morning. I have a double-espresso cappuccino, but no food.","Everybody has to put purees underneath everything now. It's like people think we need the steak, and then we need some baby food with it.","Restaurants are like having children: it's fun to make them, maybe, but then you have them for good and bad. You are going to have to raise them and if something goes wrong when they are 30 years old, they will still be your little boy.","I tell everybody the same thing: You have to make every dish so when you taste it, you should remember it when you go home.","There's a lot of processed food in America and I know that can make some tourists who're used to fresh food feel sick.","I grew up in Austria, and for me real comfort food is Wiener Schnitzel. Wiener Schnitzel and mashed potatoes because it reminds me of my youth... It reminds me when I grow up and it feels very comforting.","I learned more from the one restaurant that didn't work than from all the ones that were successes.","The most important thing for me is to really buy the best ingredient.","I like to be firm. But it is easier to be nice than to be nasty.","I believe that London is the most exciting food city in Europe.","I like Dover sole. It's always one of my favorites. I like it when I'm in England. I eat it every day almost. I think it's probably one of my favorite fish.","You see fewer and fewer chefs who are really big - most stay in shape.","I always tell people that they are really the critics. If people come three times a week to your restaurant they are the ones who find something they really love.","I think the time of the formal dinners is over.","I left school when I was 14 to work in kitchens.","When you meet someone, ask about what hobby they have, not what they do. People always ask me about cooking, but I prefer to talk about tennis or boxing.","I grew up so poor in Austria that we never took a vacation with my family.","I really love Paris. It's my favorite city.","New Yorkers think they have everything, all the best art and music. But really L.A. is a better place.","It's very important in a restaurant to really do the right hiring because there's no restaurant that you have one cook and one chef and nobody else in the kitchen. Generally you have five, ten, 15 people with you. So that's really important is to train them right, but first you have to hire the right people.","When I'm in Los Angeles, my wife and I go to the farmers' market with the kids every Sunday.","Acting is a very artistic profession and there are thousands of people out there who think they are actors but there are very few who have real talent.","When I do a cooking class now, I tell people that the most important part is to read the recipe many times so you know what you're doing. What I don't tell them, though, is that sometimes I do parties where I'm rushing so much I don't have time to follow my own advice.","A lot of chefs are traditional and do it very well. But the ones who are the most successful are the ones who change things. That is why someone like Heston Blumenthal is a genius.","The good news about showcasing chefs and the TV shows is they've attracted a lot more smart kids to the profession than 30 years ago. On the downside, though, these young chefs all say they want their own restaurant and their own TV show.","It's a myth that generally Asians are mostly vegetarians. The Japanese are the kings of red meat, but it's expensive. The Chinese and Vietnamese love their pork. Many Indians, especially the Muslims, can't live without their lamb.","When I was 27, if I didn't put 15 things in one dish I wasn't happy.","I think it's really important to keep on staying motivated.","Television in the '80s was very limited. There was no Food Network.","Now everybody thinks that once you do Top Chef, then 13 weeks later you're a chef. Nobody wants to learn to cook anymore."],"Wolfgang Schauble":["There are several silver linings on the horizon. The current account deficits in Spain and Portugal are declining because they have become more competitive and they're exporting more.","Crisis and pressure help foster change - that's why I'm not so pessimistic towards crises.","Even when one is doing well, one still worries that things might go badly again in the future. This is an old observation based on human experience.","The German export successes are not the result of some sort of currency manipulation, but of the increased competitiveness of companies. The American growth model, on the other hand, is in a deep crisis.","If you are prepared to run for public office, you also have to be willing to accept a debate about you.","I would wish for more British involvement in Europe, not less.","As for the role of France and Germany: French politics is often more self-confident then German politics due to the catastrophe in the first half of the last century. If Berlin and Paris don't agree, then it is difficult to make progress in Europe.","If we were to have a presidential election in Europe it would be an event that would spark a huge interest in people from Lisbon to Helsinki, just like national elections. And it would create a completely different political setting in Europe.","The presidency of the Euro group is an interesting and important task.","As a wheelchair user, you can't move about freely. That's the only thing that bothers me a little. When I'm in the Euro Group in Brussels, colleagues who want to talk to me have to come to me. But I hope they know that this has nothing to do with arrogance.","In the long term, Germany didn't need a finance minister who was absent during important negotiations in the European Council. But the chancellor strongly encouraged me to stay. And everything did work out for the best in the end.","Politics means competition, especially in senior positions. If you don't know that, you're not especially suited to politics.","We cannot allow the bankruptcy of a euro member state like Greece to turn into a second Lehman Brothers.","Greece's debts are all denominated in euros, but it isn't clear who holds how much of those debts. For that reason, the consequences of a national bankruptcy would be incalculable. Greece is just as systemically important as a major bank.","It is true that no member state can be required to make payments to others. But if countries want to offer voluntary assistance, as in the Greek case, this isn't only allowed, but it's also in Germany's interest. We all benefit by ensuring the stability of the euro zone.","I would caution against fueling cheap populism. First of all, every German who has spent a vacation in Greece knows that the standard of living there isn't higher than it is in Germany. Second, Greece is paying a high price for European assistance.","I think there will be no government bankruptcy in Greece.","My private financial situation is such that I don't need to worry about my investments. I don't have much to invest.","This much is true: When we created the euro, it wasn't possible to create a political union along with it. People weren't ready for that. But since then, they've grown more willing to go in that direction. It's a process, one that is sometimes laborious and sometimes slow. But it's important to keep the populations involved.","I've been a politician long enough to know that every year will find us living in a situation that one couldn't have imagined a year previously. Sometimes it's better than we imagined, sometimes it's not as good.","Europe should speak more effectively and clearly with one voice in the world.","Germany has always stood for an E.U. of the 27 countries. But in light of Britain's continued resistance to further integration steps, as we saw with the fiscal pact, there are limits to my optimism in this regard. It's quite possible that we will have to create the new institutions for the euro zone first.","Mr. Geithner is an excellent minister. We have a good personal relationship.","The United States lived on borrowed money for too long, inflating its financial sector unnecessarily and neglecting its small and mid-sized industrial companies."],"Wolfgang Tillmans":["There is this looking at the world as shapes and patterns and colors that have meaning, and you can't deny the superficial because the superficial is what meets the eye.","It's very real, the narrow line between a night danced away and the potential of death around the corner.","In order to engage in an 'experiencing of the world,' one has to physically move oneself to the most diverse places on earth.","Books have this function that help me to understand the work I've done, to wrap it up.","Change in my work happens not in revolutions - it's more evolutionary.","A photocopier is a camera in its own right. I was fortunate to grow up in the time and culture that I did. I was allowed to develop an awareness that the art that really moves me is actually based on an original image.","When I was growing up, all the art that touched me was lens-generated, like Gerhard Richter, or Polke, Rauschenberg, Warhol.","On the one hand I follow a vocation because I have an ability that I should exercise, but I want to use it for a reason, because I don't see that the freedoms that I enjoy are God-given realities. So I have a very healthy, activist general tension in me which feels that no, this is not gratuitous, it is important to keep this in focus.","Books have this function that help me to understand the work I've done, to wrap it up. Once it's done, fortunately, it doesn't mean there's closure.","I want the pictures to be working in both directions. I accept that they speak about me, and yet at the same time, I want and expect them to function in terms of the viewer and their experience.","I see my practice as picture making. Whatever is available, I use."],"Wolfman Jack":["It would take me three or four lifetimes to do everything I want. I'm a Brooklyn boy who learned to hustle, and I have to do something every day or I get the guilties.","I taught myself to tune in to another person's wavelength, figure out what they were looking for, and try to project that thing back at them.","I know it sounds corny, man, but I like to bring folks joy, and I like to have a good time. I know folks like to be with somebody who's having a good time. You sure as hell don't want to be with somebody who's having a bad day.","I appreciate folks asking for my autograph.","I want to go back to the format that radio started with rock n' roll, with country artists and rhythm and blues with that oldies type feeling. I want to put it all together and create a Top 40 of rhythm and blues and country and straight blues with Wolfman at the reins.","From 1958 to 1964, that's real rock n' roll. Then the Beatles hit and everyone sounded like them.","Half the time I feel like I'm appealing to the downer freaks out there. We start to play one downer record after another until I begin to get down myself. Give me something from 1960 or something; let me get up again. The music of today is for downer freaks, and I'm an upper.","I don't want people mistreating me. I found out when you're vulnerable and your heart's open, then people step on you. You're really stupid for letting that happen. And the only way to counteract that is to be like Wolfman Jack. Because if you do nice, kind things for people, then how are they going to mess you over?","The one thing I've learned, getting out to all those foreign and domestic locales, is that people in every country of the 'civilized' world wish - either secretly or openly - that they had the expressiveness, the flair, the I'm-so-glad-to-be-me spirit that black folks have made a part of American life.","We are put on this earth to have a good time. This makes other people feel good. And the cycle continues.","My fake Japanese was smooth enough to earn me the title of 'The Emperor of Pleasing Graciousness' in that country.","I started out as an opportunistic renegade. By now, I've lasted long enough to become sort of an American Original Respectable Renegade.","A little mordida, here. A little mordida, there.","Some people said my acting was a cross between Euell Gibbons, Rodney Allen Rippy and Sheena, Queen of the Jungle.","If you do right, everything will come out right.","I never prayed for no money, and I never prayed for no fame. I said, 'I'll take care of that myself. You just keep me healthy and I'll do all I can to try to turn people around, to try to steer 'em in the right direction.' That's the whole trip in life, ya know.","I am just a little tired of the Stones and the Beatles, and I don't care if I ever hear 'Louie Louie' ever again.","I looked real Neanderthal. I could have been Mexican, I could have been black; I could have been anything.","I've got that nice raspy sound.","When I started at XCRF in 1960, Mexico was the most lenient country in the world when it came to radio.","Bob Smith from Brooklyn is a guy who sometimes gets hung with problems and fears. Wolfman Jack is a happy-go-lucky guy who knows how to party. The challenge of my life has been letting more and more of Bob Smith go, becoming the Wolfman on an almost full-time basis, while still taking care of business.","I'm very rich - in friends. I'm too nice a fellow. I give most of my money away.","I'm not crazy about the rap thing. Or house music.","I figure the oldies are real close to what rocking country use to be.","Kids like classic rock, and so do adults."],"Wong Kar-wai":["Sometimes, we have to turn our camera to a mirror to shoot something, and people think, 'Oh, that's very stylish.' Yes it is, but at the same time, we did it because we are shooting in a very small space, and that was our only option.","Some actors like encouragement. Some actors prefer to have pressure. And sometimes, for some actors, its better to give your comment by silence, because they are so skillful, so gifted, that they understand without talking too much.","I don't do rehearsal. Some directors prefer to do rehearsal - readings before the actual shooting - but I don't like this process because I think there are certain things that are so spontaneous, and they cannot happen twice.","I think of action as a dance. It's a riddle; it should have emotion in it.","When it's time to let go, I don't look back, and I start another project as soon as possible. One thing I remind myself is that I don't want to Photoshop my past.","Somehow, we fall in love with the films and don't want to let go, but financially and physically, we cannot afford it.","At film festivals, I put on my sunglasses and go to sleep because I don't want to see my films again.","To me, romantic means, um, you follow your heart more than your mind. Sometimes when you're shooting a film, you have to follow your heart.","This is what the difference is between Hong Kong and Chinese cinema - Chinese cinema was made for their own communities. It was for propaganda. But Hong Kong made films to entertain, and they know how to communicate with international audiences.","It used to be when you eat, you eat with people. But instant noodles are so instant that people eat by themselves. And it's a very convenient way of eating but also a very lonely way of eating.","One's memories aren't what actually happened - they're very subjective. You can always make it much better, right?","The reason it takes me so long to make a film, the reason it gets so difficult, is that I'm trying to think of every film as the last one I will ever make so it can be the best it can possibly be. I don't want to have regrets or excuses or think, 'I can do better next time.'","The Chinese government promised Hong Kong '50 years, and change.' And 50 years later, after 1997, will be 2046; I think, 'Well, that's a very interesting promise.' So I want to make a film about promise.","I'm not coming from film school. I learned cinema in the cinema watching films, so you always have a curiosity. I say, 'Well, what if I make a film in this genre? What if I make this film like this?'","When I look at 'Fallen Angels,' I realize it is not a film that is truly about Hong Kong. It's more like my Hong Kong fantasy. I want Hong Kong to be quiet, with less people.","What's so great about inspiration is sometimes it finds you when you're not looking.","Sometimes, when you're on the streets, certain music inspires you, and then you have a vision. But, at the end of the day, it's a synthesis of visions, so you have to think, as a director, of a scene, or how to deliver a line, or how do this visually.","Each production has certain circumstances that will bring you to a certain way of making it. It is not intentional, it is not an artistic decision, the way we make films, it is the way we address to our problems.","I have an image of Shanghai, which is quite different from other directors, I think. The story of Shanghai should happen in back alleys.","In much the same way Ip Man embodied the struggles of the Chinese people, I wanted Gong Er to represent the changing role of women.","I've always wanted to make a film about the Tong Wars, the rioting and the crime factions in San Francisco's Chinatown in the early part of the last century.","Because we don't have a lot of light, because we have a very low budget, we have to adjust the speed of our camera to get the effect that we want. So sometimes this is the way we work, and the result of the filming becomes a kind of a style.","Chinese martial artists consider themselves to be gardeners, and it's an honor for them to take care of this garden, to better it and hand it over to the generations that follow. I think that's a very important message in a time when personal achievement seems to be the only criteria of success.","After the Revolution in '49, all the films were propaganda. They serviced the government and carried the message that the government wants to relay to the people. But I think, in the last 10 years, because the film market is opening and there's an expansion of all the cinemas in China, it's now a lot like Hollywood productions.","I was born in Shanghai and moved to Hong Kong the year I was five.","My films are never about what Hong Kong is like, or anything approaching a realistic portrait, but what I think about Hong Kong and what I want it to be.","I never studied film formally at school, but as a kid, I spent most of my time in cinemas.","In my first film, we always tried to have a script and work in a normal way, but I was constantly changing things during shooting. Because I worked as a scriptwriter for 10 years, I understood that directors always wanted to change what was originally written, to improve on it.","I came to Hong Kong when I was five, but we didn't have any relatives in Hong Kong. My mom is a big movie fan, and she watched all kinds of movies, so when I was a kid, basically, we went to watch a movie every day.","I didn't know anything about martial arts. I'm a big fan, but I never practiced martial arts.","My mother has a very big family in Shanghai, so I have, like, almost 40 cousins, so we stayed together all the time. So by the time I get to Hong Kong, I become the only child and the only one surrounded by adults, you know.","I think one day I can make a book about coffee shops in Hong Kong. I spent almost most of my time in coffee shops, in different coffee shops.","I'm not very aware of styles. We never talk about styles before we start shooting, or even during shooting, because I think the film will bring you there.","Heritage is something martial-arts films don't often talk about.","I'm a big fan of martial arts films, novels and radio programs.","1936 is a very important year: a golden time for martial arts, right before the Japanese invasion.","'Ashes of Time' was my third film, and as a young director at that point, it's not very often that you have the chance to make a big martial arts film, so of course I jumped at this opportunity.","I never had a problem with genre because a genre actually is like a uniform - you put yourself into a certain uniform. But if you dress up in a police officer's uniform, it doesn't mean that you are an officer; it can mean something else.","During shooting, you have the idea, like, of this certain dress on this actress, but it's not to fit, so you have to make all of these alterations and modifications. So in a way, I build the characters with the cast, and it's sort of custom-made, the whole process, and then you have to make all of these adjustments.","I sometimes compare making a film to cooking. Some dishes need to be stewed, while others need to be fried.","Ip Man was an extraordinary man who lived during extraordinary times. He was born to a rich family when the country was still a monarchy and lived through various civil wars, revolutions, the Japanese invasion, and the establishment of the Republic.","In most kung fu films, they want to create a hero who's always fighting a bad guy. In the story of Ip Man, he's not fighting physical opponents. He's fighting the ups and downs of his life.","When you look at martial arts films, the later ones became more and more exaggerated. It's like, wow, is martial arts only a show?","What makes international cinema so interesting is that each territory has its own sensibility. When you look at an Indian or French film, there's a certain flavor. And even though the language is different, if the film is successful, it has something very common and understandable.","The laboratory where we stored all our negatives went bankrupt overnight following the Asian economic crisis in 1997. So, on short notice, we had to retrieve all the materials in the middle of the night before the debtor-receiver took over the laboratory the next morning.","I think, to be a director, sometimes you need to have certain hunches - you have to believe in some gut feeling.","It is always good to work with a very regular group of people because we know how high we can fly and what are the parameters, and it becomes very enjoyable.","I started out my career as a screenwriter and quickly discovered that adhering to a script isn't always the best way to make a film. You have to take into consideration the nuances of the characters and what the actors bring to their roles.","To make a film like 'The Grandmaster,' I know I'm not going to make just a standard kung-fu film; it's not going to be just tricks or like wire works. So I spent seven years on the road interviewing different schools and a lot of real grandmasters from Chinese martial arts.","The industry and support in China has really matured because there are so many productions there. At the same time, there's been a lot of changes in the market, which I think also has enabled productions like 'The Grandmaster' to happen and to be possible to shoot in China.","Americans always see China through the looking glass, and I think it's about time - with technology and of the growing economic relationship between these two countries - I think it's natural and better for all of us to have a better understanding of each other.","The original title for 'In the Mood for Love' was called 'A Story About Food.' The idea was to tell a love story through different courses.","To make films, it always begins with two words: what and how. First of all, you have to find a story, or what are you going to tell? And you have to find a way to tell it visually.","For 'Chungking Express,' the way we shot the film was all handheld and with all this existing light, and that became very popular. Everybody thought it was cool.","I am just the band leader, and I just keep everything in tune.","In our case, we have no script. So the only people we can work with are people who have been working with us in the past, and they know we are going to do something; it's kind of a trust.","I don't want to be a grumpy old man or too pessimistic, because if I have a chance, I would prefer to watch a film in the cinema with an audience on a big screen instead of watching it on a cell phone. It's a very different experience, but somehow I think this form will have its own future and life."],"Wood Harris":["We had a very normal, sort of ghetto, urban upbringing. My father was a bus driver and my mother was a seamstress and a substitute schoolteacher, off and on. So, that all adds up to no money.","My first artistic love was drawing and painting.","With film, you can feel confident that you're doing good work, but never know what it's going to look like.","If you overdo something, you end up typecast. You always have to expand."],"Woodrow Wilson":["You are not here merely to make a living.

You have to go through the twilight into the broadening day before the noon comes and the full sun is upon the landscape.","America lives in the heart of every man everywhere who wishes to find a region where he will be free to work out his destiny as he chooses.","Neutrality is a negative word. It does not express what America ought to feel. We are not trying to keep out of trouble; we are trying to preserve the foundations on which peace may be rebuilt.","I would rather lose in a cause that will some day win, than win in a cause that will some day lose.","Liberty has never come from Government. Liberty has always come from the subjects of it. The history of liberty is a history of limitations of governmental power, not the increase of it.","Prosperity is necessarily the first theme of a political campaign.","America is not anything if it consists of each of us. It is something only if it consists of all of us.","There can be no equality or opportunity if men and women and children be not shielded in their lives from the consequences of great industrial and social processes which they cannot alter, control, or singly cope with.","Caution is the confidential agent of selfishness.","The government, which was designed for the people, has got into the hands of the bosses and their employers, the special interests. An invisible empire has been set up above the forms of democracy.","Business underlies everything in our national life, including our spiritual life. Witness the fact that in the Lord's Prayer, the first petition is for daily bread.

Many an unhappy man has been of deep service to himself and to the world.","That a peasant may become king does not render the kingdom democratic.","Politics I conceive to be nothing more than the science of the ordered progress of society along the lines of greatest usefulness and convenience to itself.","A conservative is a man who just sits and thinks, mostly sits.","Democracy is not so much a form of government as a set of principles.","The awakening of the people of China to the possibilities under free government is the most significant, if not the most momentous, event of our generation.","I have long enjoyed the friendship and companionship of Republicans because I am by instinct a teacher, and I would like to teach them something.","When I give a man an office, I watch him carefully to see whether he is swelling or growing.","He is not a true man of the world who knows only the present fashions of it.","What we seek is the reign of law, based upon the consent of the governed and sustained by the organized opinion of mankind.","The seed of revolution is repression.","Absolute identity with one's cause is the first and great condition of successful leadership.","Princeton is no longer a thing for Princeton men to please themselves with.

I suck them frozen.","His lack of education is more than compensated for by his keenly developed moral bankruptcy.","In Beverly Hills... they don't throw their garbage away. They make it into television shows.","I don't have to 'freedom-kiss' my wife when what I really want to do is French-kiss her.","I am two with nature."],"Woody Guthrie":["There's several ways of saying what's on your mind. And in states and counties where it ain't too healthy to talk too loud, speak your mind, or even vote like you want to, folks have found other ways of getting the word around. One of the mainest ways is by singing.","This land is your land, this land is my land, From California to the New York Island. From the redwood forest to the Gulf Stream waters This land was made for you and me.","Left wing, chicken wing, it don't make no difference to me.","If you play more than two chords, you're showing off.","I got started in Oklahoma. That's where I was born. Population down there is one-third Indians, one-third Negroes and one-third white people.","Life has got a habit of not standing hitched. You got to ride it like you find it. You got to change with it. If a day goes by that don't change some of your old notions for new ones, that is just about like trying to milk a dead cow.","I ain't a Communist necessarily, but I been in the red all my life.","I like to write about wherever I happen to be."],"Woody Harrelson":["We've killed a million Iraqis since the start of the Gulf war - mostly by blocking humanitarian aid.","In the courtroom, it's where a lawyer really becomes an actor. There's a very fine line between delivering a monologue in a play and delivering a monologue to a jury. I've always felt that way - I've been in a lot of courtrooms. The best lawyers are really theatrical.","Pesticides came about after the first world war. Some brainy petrochemical money maker said, 'Hey, that mustard gas worked great on people, maybe we could dilute it down and spray it on our crops to deal with pests.'","When I'm in New York, I bike everywhere. I have a couple of bikes stored over at Ed Norton's. It's the only way to go. But in Hawaii, I drive. I have a little Volkswagen Bug, from the 'Drive it? Hug it?' phase. I run it on biodiesel.","I think my best skill in this whole deal is as a conduit to try to bring people together, because I think it's in our unity that we'll have the greatest strength.","The government may change faces from time to time, but it's not like we fight wars for democracy - we fight wars for capitalism and for oil.","Economically, many folks don't feel they can afford organic. While this may be true in some cases, I think more often than not it's a question of priority. I feel it's one of the most important areas of concern ecologically, because the petrochemical giants - DuPont, Monsanto - make huge money by poisoning us.","To the men in Washington, the world is just a giant Monopoly board.","With 'Hunger Games,' it's about people rising up to fight against a corrupt government that controls them.","I used to eat burgers and steak, and I would just be knocked out afterward; I had to give it up.","If I'm in Maui, I play soccer and tennis and go kite-surfing. I prefer doing a sport as opposed to going to a gym. I'm not big on gyms. When I did 'Rampart,' I lost 30 pounds because I felt it was better for the character. I worked out constantly, maybe twice a day, and minimized caloric intake.","I try to apply the organic concept to my clothes and bedding as well. There's nothing like swimming in organic cotton sheets.","It's an odd beast, fame. It's got multiple personalities.","I had a hard time with that hockey. I hadn't grown up skating, so that was my biggest challenge. We worked on it and worked on it. But then when we first shot it, it was so hard for me.","Two boxes of Step Forward Paper saves one tree - that's a real stat.","The history taught in our schools is scandalous. We grew up believing that Columbus actually discovered America. We still celebrate Columbus Day. Columbus was after one thing only - gold.","My main hope for myself is to be where I am.","A grownup is a child with layers on.","I think, on a personal level, everybody, when you go through the checkout line after you get your groceries and they say, 'Paper or plastic?' We should be saying, 'Neither one.' We should have our own cloth bags.","The war against terrorism is terrorism.","And Garrison Keillor I think is a fascinating guy and really entertaining.","But I just felt at one point that I was on a hamster wheel, you know? Just doing movie after movie and thinking so much about career related things and I think missing out on hanging with my friends and family as much I needed to.","Even though there's an entertainment value to the film, I think it's very important because you can't really separate the impact of that political message from it. It's rare that you get films like that I think; that really have an important message and are also entertaining.","I never was disillusioned with acting because I love acting.","I related to his disillusionment. Thinking that he was going for this big dream. Then he kind of saw through it all at one point and went back home. Then he started a bender, which I can relate to of course.","Right now there should be a moratorium on the cutting down of old growth in this country. That is a small thing to ask at this point. There is only four percent of old growth left. Ninety-six percent of it has been cut down.","Salma is just one of the great goddesses ever put on this Earth.","So I just took some time off. I was maybe going to do two or three years and it turned into five years. But certainly, I'd say it was the best thing I ever did. And now I come back to this whole thing really energized about it.","Some people make a great film and then they can't follow up.","There's just something extraordinary about that Selma Hayek.","Well for six years during Cheers I couldn't get another job.","When I was in the seventh grade I did a report about the environment and the loss of species. It was supposed to be only a few pages, but ended up being nearly 50.","Violence was almost an aphrodisiac for me.","I don't believe in politics. I'm an anarchist, I guess you could say. I think people could be just fine looking after themselves.","Through my work with PETA, I have learned a great deal about chimpanzee behavior and the plight of chimpanzees imprisoned in laboratories.","I wrapped a movie called 'Zombieland,' in which I was constantly under assault by zombies, then flew to New York, still very much in character. With my daughter at the airport I was startled by a paparazzo, who I quite understandably mistook for a zombie.","We don't get the greatest tools to deal with anger. It's like, 'Hey, count to 10.' When someone really upsets me, how do I respond? I don't usually start counting to 10 and breathing deeply.","You have to focus on what you're passionate about. For me it's the forests and of course, because I'm concerned about the forests, I'm concerned about the way paper is made.","I love England, the people, the parks, the theatre.","The giant industries that are polluting our planet as well as violating human rights worldwide are the ones nearest and dearest to the hearts of American politicians.","If you manage to stop the timber industry from cutting this forest, they'll cut that forest. If you stop oil drilling here, they'll go drill there.","I used to have Bible studies at my house. I was in the choir. I was mischievous but also a real mama's boy. It was a pretty happy childhood.","I used to have terrible acne on my face: red, splotchy discoloration. And mucus - I was constantly blowing my nose. Then one day, this woman sits down next to me on a bus, and says, 'You're lactose-intolerant.' It all cleared up in three days. That changed my life. Doctors couldn't figure it out.","When I had just started 'Cheers,' my nerves were ajangle, to put it mildly. I was absolutely terrified. What you're learning is to not show the fear, and to ultimately overcome it so that the level of relaxation is commensurate with the level of tension.","'Natural Born Killers' is really a misunderstood romantic comedy.","I remember my daughter Deni coming along, and she was so pure and caring of everybody and everything. And somehow, this little being managed to get around all the obstacles - the gun turrets, the walls, the moats, the sentries - that were wrapped around my heart. My heart at that time needed her.","I'm one of those actors who is going to come in with 2,500 ideas. You can shoot down 2,499, but one of them you're going to like.","You know, I was on 'Cheers' for eight years, and I couldn't get another job, and I thought, 'I'm going to be Woody Boyd forever.' Which is not bad, but I really thought I was capable of more.","I've been in so many good movies that I felt like nobody saw; it's a pretty dreadful feeling.","I went to a Presbyterian college, you know, I was in... all the way, and so I remember doing my first sermon when I was 17, I was in high school. It wasn't a full twenty-five minute sermon, but for like ten minutes I got up and they let me do that, and it was on faith.","I have a strong spiritual life. I can't say that I have faith that Jesus is my Savior, but I look at Jesus in the same way that I look at, you know, Mohammed. He was giving everyone the goods. So was Gandhi.","To me, I think it's this thing of everyone wanting to make Jesus the Son of God and Jesus the only way to God that is the thing that no longer makes me want to be a Christian.","Everything I do, I try to think, 'Okay, what are the ramifications?' Like, with the clothes I wear, I prefer if it's grown organically, because cotton - which is what's used in most clothing - takes up 50 percent of all pesticide use.","I was a freshman in college in 1980, the year that Reagan was elected, and I went around badgering people to vote for him.","You can do a movie and hope it may be great, but until you have seen it, you don't know. I loved 'Rampart.' I love that one called 'The Hi-Low Country' that Steven Frears shot.","On 'The Messenger,' just imagining playing the part of a soldier in that movie was kind of hard for me. And in 'Rampart,' the idea of playing a cop was even harder. It was hard to imagine myself as a cop.","I remember my first run-in with cops. It took me really getting to hang, well after that, with cops who were cool, and realizing, 'Okay, there are some bad ones.' I ran into some bad ones in Columbus, Ohio, but they're not all bad.","The state of the health of the individual is equivalent to the state to the health of the colon.","With 'Rampart,' I read it and I'm like, 'That's the best role I've ever been offered. Phenomenal.' But, I was daunted, you know? Like the concept of trying to be a cop. It's just bizarre, man. Bizarre to even think about.","It's really been a long-term dream of mine to have an alternative to wood-based paper. Over half of the trees cut in the world are cut for paper products.","I'm not a Twinkie lover. I don't do sugar or dairy either.","I think I've been an incredible example to my kids of what not to do.","I'm an anarchist and I do think things such as Occupy Wall Street are about getting a little closer to the solution.","Sometimes I feel people think I live on a commune but I don't. We are all solar, though. There are no power lines. It's mostly farmers, so everyone who has tractors uses bio-diesel.","When I was younger, I wanted to be a cop. Then I watched 'The Wild Wild West,' and so I wanted to be in the Secret Service like James West. At some point I realized, 'That guy is not in the Secret Service. He's an actor.' That sounds like a good idea too.","I wish I'd done 'Dumb and Dumber.' I was offered the part, but I don't think I'd have been better than Jeff Daniels was. Another film I wish I'd done was 'Jerry Maguire.'","I try not to spend too much time with regret, although I wish I'd had more hang time with my dad.","I do sometimes lecture people about what they're eating, but that's only if they ask me."],"Woody Hayes":["Paralyze resistance with persistence.","I'm not trying to win a popularity poll. I'm trying to win football games.","Success is the only motivational factor that a boy with character needs.","The five big mistakes in football are the fumble, the interception, the penalty, the badly called play, the blocked punt - and most of these originate with the quarterback. Find a mistake-proof quarterback and you have this game won.","Without winners, there wouldn't even be any civilization.","Football is, after all, a wonderful way to get rid of your aggressions without going to jail for it.","Nothing that comes easy is worth a dime.","A good general always makes you search for his weaknesses.","I don't like nice people. I like tough, honest people.","I am not very smart, but I recognize that I am not very smart.","The players fire the coach, and as long as I'm on the same wavelength with them, I can coach as long as I want to.","I may not be able to outsmart too many people, but I can outwork 'em.","The game of football is one of strategy and tactics.","Success - it's what you do with what you've got.","A man is always better than he thinks.","The bowl games are only supposed to be a fun reward.","I don't apologize for anything. When I make a mistake, I take the blame and go on from there.","Nobody despises to lose more than I do. That's got me into trouble over the years, but it also made a man of mediocre ability into a pretty good coach.","No back in the history of football was ever worth two fumbles a game.","The most deceptive course in football is straight at the goalposts.","I speak at a lot of banquets in small towns, because small towns have so many great people.","As the youngest, I don't think there was any doubt I was spoiled.","My brother and I were still in high school playing football, and we were both middleweight, and we couldn't find anyone else to fight in our weight class, so we'd fight each other. I was a stand-up fighter, and Ike was a weaving type of fighter, and we fought that way out there at Cy Young's farm, and we put on quite a show.","On our first date, all Anne wanted to talk about was Bob Feller, the new pitcher for the Cleveland Indians.","I'm no longer the head football coach at Ohio State."],"Woody Herman":["There were a lot of times where there was a great deal of fodder recorded and played, because there was a market for it - just as there is today. And there were more bad bands than there were good bands - I think that should always be remembered.","I'm going to be on the road for the rest of my life.","The singing was something I got from my father.","My only claim to fame, if I have one, is that I'm an editor."],"Woody Norris":["I became an inventor by accident. I was out of the Air Force in 1956. No, no, that's not true: I went in in 1956, came out in 1959, was working at the University of Washington, and I came up with an idea, from reading a magazine article, for a new kind of a phonograph tone arm.","All of audio as we know it is an attempt to be more and more perfectly linear. Linearity means higher quality sound. Hypersonic sound is exactly the opposite: it's 100 percent based on non-linearity.","When you listen to stereo on your home system, your both ears hear both speakers. Turn on the left speaker sometime and notice you're hearing it also in your right ear.","I've been really lucky as an inventor. I'm the happiest guy you're ever going to meet. And my dad died before he realized anybody in the family would maybe, hopefully, make something out of themselves.","There's a smugness that goes with being a huge company. The big fish say, 'If it's so great, why didn't we invent it?' But how'd you like to be makin' buggy whips when cars came along?","I had a terrible fear of not being normal - of not seeming normal. So I went to the library and read every psychology book I could find. Anything about how normal people behave.","I'm very simple. I have to be. I'm not very smart. I start broad, then go deep where I'm interested.","I'm not even an engineer. I don't have a college degree; I hire guys with college degrees.","I invent by analogy. I thought, 'It's commonplace that you can mix colors, smear them together to get new emerging colors. Likewise, you can mix radio waves to get new frequencies.' So, I wondered, 'Why can't you mix sound to get new sounds?'","I'm interested in everything.","I'm the laziest inventor you ever met. My inventing is in my head - I don't have to be in the lab working and sweating.","It's embarrassing that we're in the 21st century and we don't even know what makes gravity work. I'm getting older and thinking maybe I should tackle more than the mundane. I may fail, but at least I will have tried.","I spent much of my life dying for somebody to help me even file for a patent or make a prototype. I understand that.","I wasn't much into girlfriends. I was too busy tinkering in the garage.","I'm an inventor. I don't enjoy running the business."],"Wu Yi":["We will not reform the yuan until the time is right even if there is external pressure.","As for when to reform the yuan, there is no timetable yet.","We are now preparing for the reform of the yuan's exchange rate system. For such reforms to take place, we need good economic conditions... and we need to do it under tight control."],"Wyatt Earp":["Fast is fine, but accuracy is everything."],"Wyatt Russell":["The Russell side of my family is a clan with some serious genetics.","My parents are actors and never brought work home. I didn't even know what they did until I was about 10 years old. We never talked about it.","I went on an audition. I walked in the room, and it was Leslie Mann with Judd Apatow. It was intimidating.","I was in Toronto with my parents, and my dad took me to an outdoor hockey rink. I was 3 or 4, and I just remember everything about that day. For some reason, I thought, 'This is it. This is what I'm supposed to do.' And this is around the time that Gretzky came to L.A., so I immediately joined a hockey league.","In hockey, it was a freak show. I'm the son of actors and from California, and in Canada, hockey is a religion, so me coming in, it was like, 'Who the hell is this guy?' I just had to put my head down and work really hard, and it was difficult, but it made me who I am and gave me a backbone.","I had been pulling my groins in college a lot and missed my whole freshman year of college because of groin pulls. It was chronic, and I couldn't figure it out. I went to the doctor, and he told me I had hip dysplasia. So I knew my hockey days were sorta limited at that point.","Acting was something fun that my dad did, but baseball is what he really wanted to do.","The last thing I wanted to do was act, because it was the path of least resistance.","Acting was what everybody thought I should do, and at 15, when you love something so much, it's like - 'That's not what I do. That's what they do.'","Recently, my dad has been teaching me a lot - like how to read a script. It used to just be about hockey or baseball or sports of whatever. We don't have glitzy or glamour-y Hollywood-type talk, like, 'Isn't that person great?' It's more about the process of how it works.","In hockey, there are no second chances, but the great thing about acting is that there actually are. If you do a scene and you think you can do better - take two!","Having parents that have been through the wars of films and having a brother and sister who have done it at the highest level, you gain an appreciation. But we've always had closeness as a family. That's our anchor.","When you're an athlete, you've got the horse blinders on pretty thick. Your exploration of other things in life tends to be limited because you have to have such a focus on what you're doing. I wasn't a good enough player to stray from that focus and still keep my ability.","No one wants to watch anybody play baseball in a movie. What is interesting is what baseball means or sports in general means to those people doing it.","I've done two movies with Jim Mickle. He's somebody that I'd love to do another movie with.","'Boy' is one of my top-five favorite movies of all time.","My dad, in the best way possible - not in an intimidating way, but with the physically intimidating qualities that every father has - can truly be scary. The only time you saw that side of him, the raw side of him, would be in a moment when you truly were the one that screwed up.","I would consider my dad a pretty patient guy, but there was no tolerance for spoiled behavior.","Anybody that lives in America and has parents with a moderate amount of wealth can be spoiled. I see it every day - kids who are just running their parents over to get what they want because kids are smart, and they know they can manipulate their parents.","When I stopped playing hockey and started acting, the last person I was going to ask for help was my dad. He's the king of being like, 'I don't know. It's good work if you can get it. Good luck.'","The first movie that ever scared me, I feel like it wasn't a scary movie. I feel like it was 'Dennis the Menace' or something.","When I was young, with my brothers, we'd make movies all the time, and that was never scripted.","I was a hockey player. I played hockey forever. That was my life and my job until I got injured, so I get sports, and I get the sports atmosphere, the feeling around other athletes, but I never played football.","I played professional hockey in Europe. I played in the German third league and the Dutch elite league.","I got hurt when I was 19. They thought I broke my neck. I couldn't move my hands or feet, and I had a very bad experience."],"Wyck Godfrey":["You'll go see a movie like 'Matrix 2,' and the car chase goes on and on and on and on. They had all the money in the world and all the time in the world. It doesn't make it an any better action sequence.","I find, a lot of the time, kids can get stuck on, 'Oh no, he doesn't have blue eyes,' with books. You're kind of like, 'Well, that you're going to get over by the time the movie comes out.'","'Fault' became the book everybody and their mother had to read, and 'Paper Towns' is one that's beloved, but it's a bit of a smaller book.","It's important to push the agenda of hiring women directors.","A lot of times, you finish a movie, and you're either going, 'Oh, thank God, that's over,' or 'Oh, my God, it's over, and I don't want it to end.'","I guess I've always just been naturally inclined to tell stories.","When you cut a film, certain scenes fall away and don't fit into the shape of the movie.","As a kid, I was always the jokester. I was telling stories at dinner and trying to make people laugh.","'New Moon' was such a serious, depressing movie that people felt we had lost a little humor of the books.","You spend your childhood wanting to get out from your house and wanting to get away and out into the real world, and then as adults, we start to learn that things are not what we thought they were.","The final battle of 'Eclipse' kind of blows the socks off everything we've seen earlier in the series, because you finally have wolves interacting with humans and vampires in a way that's really sophisticated visual effects that we're doing in it.","I think, a lot of times in Hollywood, the right idea comes along at the right time, and it becomes in retrospect, 'Wow, why didn't I think of that?'","There are very few movies that become real phenomenons the way 'Twilight' or 'The Hunger Games' did.","Young people like things that are fresh and new. If something does seem fatigued, or derivative, they're going to let you know.","I've done a lot of genre movies.","Sometimes people get in position where they get in a big movie and overplay their hand. What that huge check does is put a target on an actor's back.","Because of the 'Twilight' series, our company gets every speculative piece of fiction from people hoping for the next 'Twilight,' and so you read them, and they all kind of wash over you after awhile."],"Wyclef Jean":["At the end of the day, just know that God made you, so you can be your own individual, and don't let people give you that peer pressure.","'Masquerade' is the autobiography of Wyclef Jean. A lot of people know me through my work with Carlos Santana or Destiny's Child, winning all those Grammy Awards, but you do not know what is going on inside me.","I always want to know what's wrong with you, why you ain't smiling. That's just my character; I just love people and want to see people having a good time.","What I'm trying to do is break the genre from what is rap and what is music.","I lived in the projects and the ghetto, and turned the negative into a positive.","I feel that life is short, so we should be disciplined, but at the same time we should have a good time.","Haiti is my country. The same way the Beatles are received in England - that's how Wyclef Jean is received in Haiti, do you know what I mean?","I lived in a hut with no roof, and I rode to school on a donkey. I used to shoot birds with a slingshot to cook for dinner. Now I prefer to get my food from KFC.","My grandfather was a voodoo priest. A lot of my life dealt with spirituality. I can close my eyes and remember where I come from.","You get quick money, it's beautiful, there's sunshine, but at the end of the day, you find out it's all a masquerade, baby. It's not what it seems.","Every generation is gonna keep changing, and you just have to embrace the change.","Bob Marley stood for universal peace and love. He tried to break racial barriers.","That's the best way to feed the human mind. That's how Bob Marley did it. He never put it in your face. After you got the groove, you were just singing the hooks, because you thought it was cool.","If I can't take five years out to serve my country as president, then everything I've been singing about, like equal rights, doesn't mean anything.","My parents were Christian.","All that violence in the world, we need to stop that.","Me and my father went through a war period where we wasn't talking. He wanted me to go to theology school - I didn't want to go. I wanted to do music. I told him I was a minister through music.","I'm cheap, and I'm proud of it!","When the Fugees were big, we made a whole lot of money, and what happened was that I saved my money and never spent it.","I know that the nice shines I have on is going to pass. The nice cars will pass. All that will stay is the music and the work. That's where I get the inspiration to help people out and work.","I do music for the love of it, and I've been doing it from a very young age: about 11.","It was important that I became successful. People say they do it for the love, and yes, you do it for the love, but you want to be successful.","I'm the hip-hop Quincy Jones of today.","Rap records don't make you feel good no more. Six months after release, it can't come back as a classic.","I was a jazz major in high school, in an all-jazz band. No matter what I do, it features my musical influences.","When I'm rhyming it's all in my head... Like the slaves, when they were picking cotton, they would block out their minds. They would sing.","My songs are really never titled. Sometimes I call it one thing. then I change it.","I'm like Cab Calloway: I love the entertainment, and I've loved entertaining people ever since I was little.","There's not a hip-hop artist that didn't snatch of piece of Bob Marley. It's totally impossible.","You know, I'm a modern day Harry Belafonte; I got the swagger of the island.","Coming from Haiti and growing up in Brooklyn, there's a lot of European influence when I get dressed up. I wear a lot of fitted suits, elegant cuts; I think it's cool to mash up a lot of different looks.","I want people to experience what it's like being from Haiti, coming to America, being Wyclef - multicultural, multilingual.","With Yele Haiti, the first thing was I'm proud of the organization and the work that the organization has done, and in the future hope to continue doing.","I want to be part of a different kind of celebrity, one that thinks not just about charity but policy.","When you enter the realm of politics, you don't enter it because you want to be popular. When I want to be popular, I pull on a guitar and sing a song.","I like to go against the grain, against what's out there. Every day is like a challenge.","I'm hands-on with everything, always trying to reach the real people.","I don't have to be president to do great things for my country, but at the same time, to get legislation and policy passed, you have to be in some kind of office. So I don't know what the future will lead to.","My daddy was a minister, my grandfather was a voodoo priest, my uncle was a mason; I was raised with a lot of studies.","When I was 11 years old, I started playing guitar.","When I rap, I get to express myself in a way where putting words together is like poetry, and sometimes it's better to talk in certain expressions than sing, you know? So I love, I love to rhyme when I want to express certain things.","Whenever I would get in trouble with my dad, my mom would always save me. So that's why I like my mom - she cool.","When I want to be popular, I pull on a guitar and sing a song. Pras did not affect me because, in the realm of politics, he has never stood up for anything.","Wyclef is a musician that tried to unite as many musicians at once as possible. I am trying to be successful at that. The greatest challenge is that, I just got arrested for protesting in NYC for cutting the school budgets... And I think that it's important to stand up. Schools are important.","What I learned from people like Carlos Santana is that you cannot get too happy after working for five years in the industry. It takes years and years, and I learned to keep a straight head and keep on working harder and harder.","I really have fans that are from 14 or 15 years old to 60.","As a producer, I always want to know what makes the kids tick.","I'm like a hippie. At the end of the day, that's what my voice caters to.","I'm most comfortable when you just give me a guitar and I just sing."],"Wylie Dufresne":["Eggs are one of my all-time favorite foods, and making the over-easy egg is a test of skill.","Hollandaise, I would like to pour over my head and just rub all over myself. Eggs Benedict is genius. It's eggs covered in eggs.","There will never be a right or wrong way to cook something, but there will always be a more informed way.","It turns out that life in the kitchen is very similar to life on a team. Sports and kitchens are about teams. I found my alternate team sport in the kitchen.","The East Village is where I cut my teeth as a kid. I ran around here on a skateboard.","Whites cook at a lower temperature, set at a lower temperature than yolks. That, to me, is very interesting. That has opened up - as an egg lover, that has opened up sort of a world of possibilities, of applications.","Neighborhoods change. In some ways, it's part of the beauty of New York City. It's in a constant state of flux.","Green vegetables are something that fascinate chefs; the ability to keep vegetables green. How do we keep them green? What makes them green? Why are they green? And then that sort of army green. Why do they go from bright vibrant electric green to army green, and how can we avoid that?","I would say that molecular gastronomy is a field of science. I would - I would say that it's probably lumped under chemistry, maybe. Because cooking, while it has certainly biology and some physics, it's mostly chemistry.","I think things like 'farm to table' are misleading. I think sometimes that becomes a pedestal or a soap box to get people into your restaurant but is not... it's almost empty in a way. I mean, my food comes from a farm, and I serve it on a table.","I can fry hollandaise, I can fry ketchup, I can fry mustard.","Whether it be cereal technology or candy technology or snack technology, puff snacks, I'm always curious to know how those things are made and how we can take that technology, those ingredients, and apply it to a stand-alone restaurant.","There's nobody you can call and say, 'So, can you maybe send me your formula for frying Hollandaise?' because to the best of my knowledge, it didn't exist before we did it.","I don't think of eggs as being fundamental to the flavor of mayonnaise, but they are to Hollandaise.","We have fried things in cubes, historically. We tried bars of Hollandaise, we tried different shapes, but it ultimately seemed like the cube was the right shape.","Typically, you learn how to cook, but you don't know why. We were looking for a deeper understanding of what was happening to our food as we roasted it, boiled it, grilled it, chopped it, etc. And it turned out, as we began to really say what is cooking, what does it mean to cook, there's a lot of science involved.","Every dish doesn't have to be showy, and every dish doesn't have to slap you in the face with technique.","I've always had fond memories of cooking Thanksgiving.","It wasn't the traditional cooking most people do. For me, as a young chef, Thanksgiving meant going to work in the kitchen at places like Gotham, JoJo and Jean-Georges.","I really don't do much on the night of Thanksgiving other than bring the wine and carve the turkey. My contribution comes the day after, in the form of breakfast. I usually just forage through the leftovers for things that will go well with eggs.","It's been a struggle to get people to come eat for fun. You know, the way they listen to music. You can do all kinds of things with music. But food - it's something people need, and that changes everything. You start playing with it, people have all sorts of reactions.","My mother made the best scrambled eggs, super-loose and soft.","I think I can poach a pretty mean egg the old-fashioned way.","When ramps are in season, we pickle a bunch of ramps and fold that into soup. Pickled pearl onions are great chopped up or pureed.","Extremely ripe things are not ideal for pickling. If you pour a hot liquid over super ripe strawberries, you're going to have strawberry soup.","The spirit of pickling is one of adventure and fun.","The most important thing with turkey is to let it rest - most people don't let it rest long enough. It will get juicier the longer you let it rest.","My job has changed over the years, 22 years roughly I've been cooking professionally. When I was younger, I aspired to be the star player. Now, it's more I like to sit in the dugout and make sure the team wins the game.","We have a funny sort of love/hate relationship with critics because, unfortunately, in the art/commerce dance that we do, they drive people to the restaurant. Regardless of sometimes how well we prepare the food, if people don't know that we're out there, if someone isn't talking about us, you guys aren't coming.","It's a funny thing, but it's often overlooked that I'm a huge devout lover of French cooking. I have the utmost respect for them, though they have lost their respect for me because they think the way I cook is nutty.","It's just about asking why. We as cooks historically have been very, very technically proficient but not technically informed as to why we do what we do. Modernist cuisine is about that knowledge.","I have no interest in vegetarians whatsoever. Zero. Less than zero.","I've been asked to endorse lots of different pieces of equipment. It's not necessarily that it's an awful thing to be asked to endorse something, because it's inherently a compliment to your skills, your abilities, on a level. But sometimes it's just not the right fit.","Okay, a lot of people think that I'm someone known for a love of eggs and egg cookery. Being asked to endorse an egg yolk separator, I mean, I understood where it came from, but it didn't seem necessarily like something that was ultimately worth pursuing.","I find it much more compelling to make a four-biter that leaves you wishing that you had a fifth. I think 'the tyranny of the entree' is the right way to put it. I don't want to build this giant plate of food.","There will never be a universal way of cooking, but information will always be universally useful.","I have strong feelings about cookbooks because I am a lover of them and student of them and devourer of them and collect them. I find them to be a great source of inspiration. When I was a cook and not making much money, I always used to spend most of what I had on cookbooks.","I would like to, at some point, do a cookbook.","I've seen cookbooks from lots of great chefs that have been disappointing. A book, to me, it has to have a story. Some of these people, they open a restaurant, and one year later, there's a cookbook. There's not much of a story yet.","I think it's important for anyone who is artistic to look back on their body of work and be critical. Maybe the Beatles can look back and say everything was perfect, but we've come up with hundreds and hundreds of dishes, and anyone who is honest with themselves has to realize that every single one wasn't an absolute, unequivocal home run.","I don't like the term 'dinner as theater,' because that implies something thespian that I don't want to tie into this, but there are plenty of times that people go out to dinner because they want to have an experience. There are, however, probably many more times that people go out to eat because it's 7 o'clock and it's time to eat.","People have been manipulating food ever since they realized cooking a whole animal was difficult. Cows don't come in hot dog form.","I present classics in an unfamiliar way or unfamiliar ingredients and preparations in a classical way.","As a pure source of reference, 'Modernist Cuisine' is incredibly helpful. It's like a modern-day encyclopedia, except for a single subject. It's not always the answer, but it's always a starting point. I feel honored to have been able to contribute to it.","Being a chef isn't the ideal career to intersect with parenting, but I try to be in my kids' lives as much as possible.","I was working for a chef a long time ago who told me to not skip steps or be in a hurry. Success in a kitchen is more like a marathon and less like a sprint. Rising up the ranks too quickly isn't necessarily a good thing. This advice was from a guy who was sorry he had done that and didn't want me to do the same.","I like all cheese, but my guiltiest pleasure is definitely American cheese.","American cheese is the perfect soft taco.","Fish butchering means a lot to me as a chef; I take pride in it and get a lot of joy from filleting fish, working with fish, breaking down fish, trying to understand fish.","'Top Chef' is always entertaining - it's hard to stop watching, like a good hockey fight, but no one gets hurt. It's great that the format is so inherently dramatic and can make cooking so entertaining to people who might not ordinarily be interested in a cooking show. Good for the industry all round."],"Wyndham Lewis":["It is more comfortable for me, in the long run, to be rude than polite.","Prostration is our natural position. A worm-like movement from a spot of sunlight to a spot of shade, and back, is the type of movement that is natural to men.","The art of advertisement, after the American manner, has introduced into all our life such a lavish use of superlatives, that no standard of value whatever is intact.","In the democratic western countries so-called capitalism leads a saturnalia of 'freedom', like a bastard brother of reform.","I feel most at home in the United States, not because it is intrinsically a more interesting country, but because no one really belongs there any more than I do. We are all there together in its wholly excellent vacuum.","As a result of the feminist revolution, 'feminine' becomes an abusive epithet.","If the world would only build temples to Machinery in the abstract then everything would be perfect. The painter and sculptor would have plenty to do, and could, in complete peace and suitably honored, pursue their trade without further trouble.","Men were only made into 'men' with great difficulty even in primitive society: the male is not naturally 'a man' any more than the woman. He has to be propped up into that position with some ingenuity, and is always likely to collapse.","Almost anything that can be praised or advocated has been put to some disgusting use. There is no principle, however immaculate, that has not had its compromising manipulator.","A hundred things are done today in the divine name of Youth, that if they showed their true colors would be seen by rights to belong rather to old age.","Revolution today is taken for granted, and in consequence becomes rather dull."],"Wynn Bullock":["I didn't want to tell the tree or weed what it was. I wanted it to tell me something and through me express its meaning in nature.","When I photograph, what I'm really doing is seeking answers to things."],"Wynonna Judd":["Silence is refreshment for the soul.","Most of us are imprisoned by something. We're living in darkness until something flips on the switch.","It sounds corny, but I've promised my inner child that never again will I ever abandon myself for anything or anyone else again.","You have to fill your cup. You then give away the overflowing, but you keep a cupful for yourself.","My music is about the journey, about love and the human experience.","I used to only worry about the #1's and all of the awards. But that was a long time ago.","I am most proud that I stayed true to the music of my soul.","I always make music that is true to my spirit.","The failures and successes are necessary for learning.","The mother-daughter relationship is the most complex.","Digital downloading of music has affected us all in adverse ways.","I also believe my musical abilities are a true gift from God.","I never took a music lesson in my life, it just came naturally.","When you are real in your music, people know it and they feel your authenticity.","I have always loved the process of making the music, reading the letters from the fans who get married to my music, have children to my music and play my music at their funerals.","If I can make a connection, one connection, to any one listener in the world, I consider that successful.","I know that the internet has helped a new world audience find me.","I am a child of God.","The love of these people and of my fans mean more than any award or special accomplishment.","Without love in you life, you have nothing.","I am a fan of today's sound as long as we don't get too slick, and yet I am very reverent of my roots.","We are losing our superstars like Johnny and June Carter Cash and that breaks my heart.","There's a place for all types of country music as long as there is honesty and realness and a real human experience for the fans.","I have a very deep and wide relationship with my fans.","I don't take my fans' love and dedication for granted.","It took me 36 years to be able to be by myself and like it.","I've learned lately that no one is going to hand me a permission slip and tell me to take time out for me.","My story of success and failure is not just about music and being famous. It's about living and loving and trying to find purpose in this crazy world.","Success takes us to the top and away from those we love.","I learned again that the mind-body-spirit connection has to be in balance.","To heal from the inside out is the key.","Because I now realize, after all this time, I have never truly felt worthy of all that I have been given."],"Wynter Gordon":["What I love about Sade other than her smooth and sultry voice is her willingness to be vulnerable. As a powerful, strong and beautiful woman of color, she showed her delicate, passionate side in a world where most of us are putting on a brave face. I love how effortless her style was and how consistent that red lip was!","My style is cinematic; it is a touch of French woman of the '60s and American hippie with a Brooklyn edge. I love wearing wide-brim hats, newsboy caps, mini dresses and sheer blouses with details.","On stage, I need to be seen from the back seats. So, I dress more colorful and vibrant.","'Stimela' is the very first video I directed. I wanted it to be an emotional visual art piece, displaying humans as free, powerful animals. We are all running from something or searching for something; our instincts have been ignored.","When I first started, the very first body of music I made when I got signed to Atlantic were songs with titles like 'Unify' and 'You're Special.' And there's this song that reminds me of Meghan Trainor that I wrote, about a woman's body and not conforming, when I first started in music.","Making dance music was one of the best things I did in my life. I traveled the world; I met the most amazing fans. I got a lot of respect from doing it.","I've been working in the music industry since I was 15 years old, and I feel like I've always been ahead of my time.","I toured with Skrillex, did an HBO commercial with Diplo. In the hip hop movement, I was the first artist Travis Scott ever featured with before he blew up. I had the songs with Chris Brown and Tyga. I've worked with some of the biggest artists in the world.","'The Human Condition' is me exploring some ideas and thoughts that I have that don't fit one sound. I'm giving emotions a sound - it's a fusion of genres. There are four EPs in 'The Human Condition'; each title is a different emotion.","My favorite song is called 'Reachout.' There are so many different stories told in that song. I think anyone who listens to it will gather a different meaning, but each answer is true. I also like the sound of it, period - there are a lot of classical influences.","I'd like to work with Florence and The Machine, Little Dragon, Frank Ocean, Miguel, Calvin Harris... there are so many artists and producers.","My style is a mashup of different eras, but each piece I have makes me feel good about myself. I do have a taste for expensive shoes.","There's beauty in pain, and everyone experiences it - and it's a lesson.","I can't live without my silver Marc Jacobs boots! They are a little bit cowboy, a little bit space alien. They go with everything.","I bought my Grasshoppers tennis shoes at a flea market in Brooklyn. They are so comfortable to lounge around in on tour.","I'm not too big on accessories, but I love my basic black quartz watch from American Apparel. It's a simple piece that goes with my vintage, thrift store chic style.","I grew up in South Jamaica, Queens, in New York. My parents were very religious churchgoing people. They were very strict. I was never really allowed to indulge in anything vain. Modesty always. I have three brothers and two sisters, so everything was on a budget.","I would love to design my own shoe line. Women suffer too much in heels. I want to design a line of sexy platform heels that don't hurt.","When we talk about my music, it's a cross between Tina Turner, Alanis Morrisette, and Diana Ross. It's the glamour and the showiness of Diana Ross; the ferociousness and pain of Tina Turner; and the vocals of Alanis.","A lot of artists get famous overseas first. I don't know what it is here. I have a large underground following in the U.S., but I don't get the airplay as much as I do in, say, Australia. Over there, they can play whatever they like, it seems, but not so much here.","I always considered myself a performer. It's what God gave me. It doesn't matter if one person hears it or a million.","I read fantasy books like the Harry Potter books, 'Twilight,' also biographies, and I like to read about people who have been through stuff like wars or lost their families - real life stuff, you know? I like to read about their experiences and how they coped with that."],"Wynton Marsalis":["Jazz music is America's past and its potential, summed up and sanctified and accessible to anybody who learns to listen to, feel, and understand it. The music can connect us to our earlier selves and to our better selves-to-come. It can remind us of where we fit on the time line of human achievement, an ultimate value of art.","I believed in studying just because I knew education was a privilege. It was the discipline of study, to get into the habit of doing something that you don't want to do.","We always hear about the rights of democracy, but the major responsibility of it is participation.","I never minded giving my opinions. They are just opinions, and I had studied music and I had strong feelings. I was happy for my opinions to join all the other opinions. But you have to be prepared for what comes back, especially if you don't agree with the dominant mythology.","Don't settle for style. Succeed in substance.","Ethics are more important than laws.","The nerves are a problem on trumpet, because when you mess up everyone can hear it. Just remember most people are too polite to say anything about it. That should calm your nerves.","Through improvisation, jazz teaches you about yourself. And through swing, it teaches you that other people are individuals too. It teaches you how to coordinate with them.","There's so much spirit of integration and democracy in jazz.","Maybe the preoccupation with technological progress has overshadowed our concern with human progress.","A musician's whole life is to listen.","Everything comes out in blues music: joy, pain, struggle. Blues is affirmation with absolute elegance. It's about a man and a woman. So the pain and the struggle in the blues is that universal pain that comes from having your heart broken. Most blues songs are not about social statements.","Trumpet players see each other, and it's like we're getting ready to square off or get into a fight or something.","I believe in professionalism, but playing is not like a job. You have to be grateful to have the opportunity to play.","There are forces all around you who wish to exploit division, rob you of your freedom, and tell you what to think. But young folks can rekindle the weary spirit of a slumbering nation.","The blues. It runs through all American music. Somebody bending the note. The other is the two-beat groove. It's in New Orleans music, it's in jazz, it's in country music, it's in gospel.","The history of jazz lets us know that this period in our history is not the only period we've come through together. If we truly understood the history of our national arts, we'd know that we have mutual aspirations, a shared history, in good times and bad.","We looked up to our father. He still is much greater than us.","Swing is extreme coordination. It's a maintaining balance, equilibrium. It's about executing very difficult rhythms with a panache and a feeling in the context of very strict time. So, everything about the swing is about some guideline and some grid and the elegant way that you negotiate your way through that grid.","If you are serious about American culture and you are serious about Afro-American culture, you are in a lot of pain. You are not - you are not smiling about it.","There was one thing Beethoven didn't do. When one of his string quartets was played, you can believe the second violin wasn't improvising.","Jazz comes from our way of life, and because it's our national art form, it helps us to understand who we are.","Through first-class education, a generation marches down the long uncertain road of the future with confidence.","I think that the blues is in everything, so it's not possible to neglect it. You hear somebody go 'Ooh ooh oooh,' and that's the blues. You hear a rock n' roll song. That's the blues. Somebody playing a guitar solo? They're playing the blues.","I feel that for years of teaching in the country and reading criticism in books, I feel like the things most needed in our culture are the understanding of the meanings of our music. We haven't done that good of job teaching our kids what our music means or how we developed our taste in music that reminds us and teaches us who we are.","When did we begin to lose faith in our ability to effect change?","My daddy thought - no, he expected - that my brothers and I and our generation would make the world a better place. He was correct in his belief because he had lived in an America of continual social progress, depression followed by prosperity, segregation by integration, and so on.","Many a revolution started with the actions of a few. Only 56 men signed the Declaration of Independence. A few hanging together can lead a nation to change.","It was Dr. King's tireless activism that fostered our modern way of relating to one another.","Many of our greatest musicians abandoned all of their aesthetic objectives to try to become pertinent. And, at the end of the day, they never became pop stars. I counter stated that very strongly, and I continue to do that.","I'm not a person who writes really abstract things with oblique references. I look at abstraction like I look at condiments. Give me some Tabasco sauce, some ketchup, some mayonnaise. I love all of that. Put it on a trumpet. I've just got to have the ketchup and Tabasco sauce. That's my attitude about musical philosophy.","The main three components are the blues, improvisation - which is some kind of element that people are trying to make it up - and swing, which means even though they're making up music, they're trying to make it up together. It feels great, like you're having a great conversation with somebody.","When I auditioned for my high school band the band director was excited because my father was known to be a great musician. When he heard me, he said 'Are you sure you're Ellis's son?'","I have absolutely no idea what my generation did to enrich our democracy. We dropped the ball. We entered a period of complacency and closed our eyes to the public corruption of our democracy.","Only a few act - the rest of us reap the benefits of their risk.","When I first came to New York everybody on the scene would treat me like I could play, but I couldn't.","Don't worry about what others say about your music. Pursue whatever you are hearing... but if everybody really hates your music maybe you could try some different approaches.","I wanted to make somebody feel like Coltrane made me feel, listening to it.","My daddy expected that my brothers and I and our generation would make the world a better place. He had lived in an America of continual social progress.","There really have only ever been a few people in each generation who step out, are willing to put themselves on the line, and risk everything for their beliefs.","What, other than injustice, could be the reason that the displaced citizens of New Orleans cannot be accommodated by the richest nation in the world?","The rebuilding of New Orleans is an important point in the history of the United States.","The best way to be, is to do.","Thank the good Lord for a job.","The bandstand is a sacred place.","The musicians I respected were much older than me. I expected them to cut my head, and they did.","I sounded like myself. People be saying I sound like Miles or Clifford Brown.","What I really have in my head, my imagination, my understanding of music, I never really get that out.","You need a team. You need people to push you. You need opponents.","Jazz is not the kind of music you are going to learn to play in three or four years or that you can just get because you have some talent for music.","I feel like a lot of the fundamental material, I've assimilated. So now the question is: Am I going to really get into my spiritual inheritance of music and really develop my abilities?","I got my first trumpet when I was six years old, from Al Hirt. My father was playing in Al Hirt's band at that time.","The first time I ever played the trumpet in public, I played the Marine Hymn. I sounded terrible.","I didn't want to get that ring around my lips from practicing the trumpet, because I thought the girls wouldn't like me. So I never practiced.","My older brother and myself always played together in bands, but we never knew we would be professional musicians.","I always read all these books about the slaves. My mother is very educated. My father would talk to us like we were grown men. We never knew what he was talking about half the time.","This rebuilding of New Orleans gives us the perfect opportunity to see if we're ready to extend the legacy of Dr. King.","It's important to address young people in the reopening of New Orleans. In rebuilding, let's revisit the potential of American democracy and American glory.","The young very seldom lead anything in our country today. It's been quite some time since a younger generation pushed an older one to a higher standard.","Don't wish for someone else to do later what you can do now.","Whenever you face a man who's playing your instrument, there's a competition.","There's the tradition in jazz of having the Battle of the Bands, and you do not want to get your head cut when you're playing.","People have taken time out of their day and spent their money to come sit down at a concert. And it's jazz music-it's not easy for them to get to it. I don't want them ever to feel that I'm taking their presence lightly.","Even in these times, there are still neighbors that will turn their backs on neighbors.","I dress up a certain way because I respect the music.","I play piano and drums very poorly and French horn and tuba all equally as bad.","My mother always took my brothers and me to music lessons. There were six children. Our parents attended our concerts and encouraged us to study and enjoy many different types of music.","When I was 12, I began listening to John Coltrane and I developed a love for jazz, which I still have more and more each year.","My father is a jazz musician, so I grew up hearing jazz. My parents loved it, but I didn't like it. It went on for too long. Yes, I had certain teachers that really inspired me, like Danny Barker, and John Longo. And I had no idea that I would have any impact on jazz.","When you create change with your point of view, you have to be ready for what comes with that.","When people dress well, they play well.","Duke Ellington always had a style: original, clean with interesting color combinations. He had an artist's eye.","Musicians like to converse. There's always interesting conversation with musicians - with classical musicians, with jazz musicians, musicians in general.","I almost never watch TV, except for '60 Minutes' and pro football. I love Drew Brees, the Manning brothers and the Steelers' linebackers.","There is an idea that a mind is wasted on the arts unless it makes you good in math or science. There is some evidence that the arts might help you in math and science.","When me and my brother would go to see our daddy playing, there'd be 30 people in the audience. I was only 14 or 15, but I realised something was wrong.","I had to figure out how to survive in New York, and most of my time was occupied in getting an apartment and getting money. A lot of older jazz guys looked out for me and found me gigs and places to stay.","Because the blues is the basis of most American music in the 20th century. It's a 12-bar form that's played by jazz, bluegrass and country musicians. It has a rhythmic vocabulary that's been used by rock n' roll. It's related to spirituals, and even the American fiddle tradition.","I try to find the core values that are so fundamental that they transcend ethnic identity. That doesn't mean I run from it. I embrace African-American culture and I love it and embrace it, but it is a part of a human identity. So I'm always trying to make a larger human statement.","There's always the cliche of the choir shouting and clapping. OK, you have to do that, but there's also introspective parts, parts where you just follow someone that's preaching. There's lots of different emotions and moods that a service requires.","In the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra we play such a diversity of music, with 10 arrangers in the band, we don't really worry about whether it's contemporary or not.","I have friends who will critique me much harder than any review.","I grew up in the South, and our way of dealing with each other was teasing, ribbing, making fun and scrapping in the street. Criticism doesn't bother me so much. It actually made me, when I was younger, more aggressive. But you get into middle age, and you lose interest in that stuff. It's not serious.","I'm just lucky to have the type of friends and musicians and people dedicated to my music that I do.","I'm not afraid of you being yourself. That's America.","I didn't have a philosophical understanding of music until I came to New York. I didn't understand how it applied to my kind and my generation. I thought it was just old people talking.","Jazz celebrates older generations and not just the youth movement. When you 'sell' only to people of a certain age, you get cut off from the main body of experience.","I generally work right up to when I have to do something - I'm always doing a lot.","My schedule is always tight. But I like to have the pressure of having to finish doing something; it gives me an added edge.","Generally, when I wake up in the morning I set out a series of problems for myself and I write them down, and when I'm sleeping, my mind solves the problems. When I wake up in the morning, I have more clarity on the issue.","The heart of a music is its rhythm. The heart of rhythm section music is the rhythm.","My thing is, once you start to put a backbeat on your music or something that has a machine in it, you have popularity, but you lose the flexibility. And you lose a richness.","What I've learned how to do as I've gotten older is to take all of the information that I have, and push it aside, and try to distill each song into an emotional theme. The hardest thing that I've ever had to learn how to do in playing music is use the sound of my instrument to create an emotional effect.","I grew up in the South, in New Orleans, where guys torture you all the time. So I didn't really grow up on the self-esteem campaign. When you were lousy at something, they told you you were lousy, and they told you how to fix it.","I became a man in New York. New York made me the musician that I am and the person that I am, so it's impossible for me to say I regret having lived there.","The majority of the high schools and the public schools in N.Y.C. don't even have band programs. Hip-hop in a lot of ways is an outgrowth of a lack of instruments and a desire to play music, so we can't really fault the kids for that.","Jazz music creates so many phenomenal figures.","As a jazz musician, you have individual power to create the sound. You also have a responsibility to function in the context of other people who have that power also."],"will.i.am":["If you are a chef, no matter how good a chef you are, it's not good cooking for yourself; the joy is in cooking for others - it's the same with music.","Disco is the first technology music. And what I mean is that 'disco' music is named after discs, because when technology grew to where they didn't need a band in the clubs, the DJ played it on a disc.","You can rule ignorance; you can manipulate the illiterate; you can do whatever you want when a people are uneducated, so that goes in line with corrupt business and corrupt politics.","I've been truly protected by my uncles.","It should be mandatory that you understand computer science.","I was born and raised in the ghetto, on welfare, two minutes from homeless.","If you really want change, you really want it to be inclusive, where everyone's included, otherwise you're just going to have more of the same in the future.","When someone is denying what they are, then that's when things start to spiral down.","How about no one's ever going to outsell Michael Jackson at selling records because the record industry is over. Game over. There's no more record stores. With no more record stores there's no more pressing plants. With no more pressing plants, there's no more charts.","I can't be quiet, as that's when I notice the ringing in my ears.","Philanthropy is the thing that I am really excited about, and having success means I can do more.","When you follow your heart, you're never supposed to do things because of what you think people might say. You do it for the opposite reasons.","Hip-hop culture is probably one of the most powerful things to come out of America in a long time - everything from the music to the art to the dance to the language.","I know people in gangs; I could have went down that route.","If I didn't mould my reality then I'd still be in the ghetto where people like me are supposed to stay. You have to dream your way out of the nightmare.","I don't need anyone to validate me.","You can get your money and you put it in the bank, or you can put it in the youth.
