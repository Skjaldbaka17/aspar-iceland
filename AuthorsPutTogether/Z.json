{"Zac Brown":["When you're wearing a motorcycle helmet, people don't know who you are. So I just wander around and, yeah, it's pretty awesome.","I try to get away and take my motorcycle on a ride whenever I can. I'll take my bike out before the show and just cruise.","I was probably 21 or 22 years old when I realized the prose that I live by, which is, 'You get what you give.' The more good deeds that you could do in your life, the more fulfilling and enriched your life is going to be. I truly believe that.","Other people pull off amazing festivals and events and things like that. I think ours is a little bit different, and that's what makes us distinct.","Everybody in my band is a lion, and everyone's mastered their own domain... And we have a platform, and we have built it painstakingly and punched ourselves in the face every way we could to get where we are.","I don't want to look back and say, 'Yeah, I was really successful, but I failed at fatherhood because I wasn't there.'","To get to record and to do things with the legends, and with the people that are your musical heroes, that's the biggest honor as an artist.","Good music makes you feel something.","We can help show data on how much the kids can improve when their home life changes a little bit.","Talent alone gets you nowhere. You really have to have the grit, and you gotta have a love for people.","If I hear one more tailgate in the moonlight, Daisy Dukes song, I wanna throw up.","When I was growing up, my dad and I would go hunting and camping every weekend. Like everyone in my family, he is an amazing cook, and I've tried to learn a lot from all of them.","I don't like cooking just for myself; I enjoy feeding other people, particularly outdoors.","I can't stand having cold air blowing in my ears, so when it's cold at my house, or if I am outside, I am going to have my ears covered up.","We just couldn't seem to get the love from the Nashville awards shows... So Grammys really gave us validation, and so that's why they're such a big deal for us.","We're all continuing to grow up and get better as musicians, and the chemistry as a band continues to deepen.","We ended up New Year's Eve playin' a show. My date had stood me up, and I remember walkin' back to my friends with, like, two minutes before midnight and thinkin', 'I'm not gonna have anybody to kiss on New Year's.' And there she was, standin' right there, and I remember kissin' her, and then that was game over.","In my opinion - in Georgia, there's a town called Lula. And Lula, Georgia, has the best peaches.","I just hope everybody stays with us. We are not trying to be snobs or jerks. We are in a whirlwind trying to figure out the best way to be accessible.","It's always humbling, knowing where we came from. From being friends with the janitor in the bar and being friends with the waitress - because they were some of the only people that were listening when we finished playing - to this, we are able to appreciate every single person and every single piece of it, because we came from nothing to this.","We always push the boundaries on the styles we put on a record.","We've gone further on this album, where we have a Big Band song, kind of a Sinatra-type song; we have a couple songs that have electronic music on them. We've got a couple rock songs, maybe a little heavier than what we've done. So the title 'Jekyll & Hyde' really covers the breadth of the record.","I want to get better every year.","Every record we do, we do one song we didn't write.","We're proud to be lifetime musicians and a band that lives like a band and loves the music and gives our lives to it.","When you are a singer, you have to nurse yourself and make sure you don't get a cold.","When I get drafty cold air in my ears, I would get an earache and get sick. I had to make sure I hustled and stayed well for my shows that I played.","To me, country music has always been the home for a great song.","When songs make me wanna throw up, it makes me ashamed to even be in the same genre as those songs.","It does make me sad that there's a lot of great songs out there, and they're not going to see the light of day because they're competing with these tailgate songs.","I love coming to Detroit. First getting to be buddies with Kid Rock in the beginning, and him being really great to us, showing us love, the love of the city. I feel like it's our city now, too.","When I'm home, I'm Daddy, and everything is completely normal.","I'm no different than any other human being. I play music for a living, and we're very blessed.","I don't want my children to have any kind of ego or entitlement because of what I do. I want them to be good people, and we fight every day so that they'll be that way.","The chemistry that you get from living with your band and creating music and recording with your band translates to the stage.","You have a feeling when you're recording, like, 'This is gonna translate really well,' and when you see it live, and it kind of proves that, that's an amazing feeling.","Maybe some people that only listen to electronic music will pick up my record and get turned on to some of the story songs, some of the more country-type stuff.","It doesn't seem expected for us to do something like that, but I love electronic music. I spend a lot of my time listening to that and just trying to understand what makes it work - what makes it move people the way it does and why they have some of the best-selling festivals in the world.","Sir Rosevelt is a little more of a persona, and we dress up, three-piece Tom Ford suits, and it's a little more refined, visually.","Visually, a lot of the electronic artists have really interesting video and interesting things like that.","When we cover a Chainsmokers song in our live show with ZBB, people are dancing and going crazy.","Some people are gonna hate anything; they're gonna hate when anybody tries to go or do anything, and that's usually the people who don't ever create anything themselves.","Each song has its own life.","We're not just going to take some songs from a focus group in Nashville where people are sitting around in a circle having appointments trying to write catchy songs so they can sell them to a band like us.","You can tell all our songs come from us and from our artists, the people we write with and travel with.","I don't think a lot of bands and artists work as hard as we do on the creation, on the writing, the arrangements and the recording in our format.","It's a crazy experience for me to be in a Foo Fighters video.","I was a music fan first way before I started creating it, so I still get giddy when I get to be around people that I respect so much.","I never get used to going out and seeing 20, 30,000 people that are there to see us play. It's kind of surreal.","The Doobie Brothers are one of my favorites of all time.","I hope everybody enjoys our input on 'Black Water' - it sure was a lot of fun getting to record it.","Our boundaries have dissolved, and we're going to still do things that are somewhat familiar that people like, but we're also going to stretch out and take chances beyond what we've done before.","Not a lot of the country format I enjoy listening to.","I'm opinionated because I care so much about the music and the songs.","I try to be really conscious. I don't want to ever look back and regret not raising my kids and not being around.","Country fans and country listeners deserve to have something better... a song that really has something to say, something that makes you feel something.","People come up to me sometimes and ask for a picture but don't even say hello. They sort of forget that I'm a person.","If we had to pose for every single person at the Eat & Greets, we wouldn't get to speak to anyone that's there, and we definitely wouldn't get to serve them food.","Getting to have a higher purpose other than just being successful is very necessary for me.","There are still great artists in the country format.","There are still artists that do a great job with a song, and they care about the lyrics, and it's not just mindless drivel.","I had a restaurant in Georgia for a while, and I really miss feeding everybody.","A lot of concerts leave you wanting for something good to eat or drink while you're there.","Everybody in my family cooks, so growing up and being around it... if I was going to spend time with everybody, it was helping them in the kitchen.","Camp Southern Ground is a lot more than a camp. It's more of a campus.","Our music has been an incredible gift to help us make a difference.","The world needs some help.","I always thought it was sad that you couldn't get anything really good to eat at concerts, so we sit down with our fans before every show and eat a gourmet meal that we made for them.","I'm from Georgia, and everybody gathers around food in the South.","We bled writing these songs, we bled in the studio, and now we're out bleeding getting them right live.","The Southern Ground warehouse is rocking and rolling in Atlanta, with a T-shirt shop and a leather shop; everything we're selling at our shows we're making or publishing ourselves.","You've got to be willing to put the time into seeing who's got talent and who's going to do a great job.","We're fabricating a state-of-the-art concessions system for our touring, so we can feed the people and give them everything they need without having to wait on it.","The lyrics are so important to me. And that there is something going on in the lyrics. That the song actually has something to say.","My brother's 21 years older than me, so I grew up doing more adult things. Like listening to old music.","All my siblings being all different ages meant I got exposed to music that was 20-30 years older than me. And that was a big influence.","If you break down most rock songs and look at the lyrics on a piece of paper, it's all about melody. It's all about presentation. And a lot of bands are really great, but you can't understand a word of what they say.","I didn't think I liked country music. Then I got into Garth Brooks.","I remember the first time I heard 'The Thunder Rolls.' It was dark, and we were driving to the beach. There was the thunder outside and the thunder in the song. It was eerie.","I have seen a lot of people, including myself, make a lot of tip money because of 'Black Water,' so this is a full circle moment. To collaborate and recreate this iconic song is just an amazing moment as an artist.","You can de-select the songs that you don't want to have on the record, but I hope we always put something out that has a lot of songs that the majority of people will love.","I've been making some more electronic music, which I really enjoy doing.","I don't ever want to stop making country, and I don't want to stop making electronic music, either.","We don't want to abandon any of the market we have now. We just want to gain new market.","Family comes out whenever we know it's gonna be steady on a run that's continuous.","If I'm chartering in and out and flying home after I play, that doesn't make sense. But where we can bus, then we'll bring the family out and spend time with them during the day.","We love our fans and are very connected with our fans.","Thanks so much to all the fans. To all our team, to all our wives, especially, that believe in us and that we come home to, and everybody here that's given us a shot.","It's an honor to live on a legacy, getting to do what we love to do and try to be the best musicians that we can possibly be.","I'm gonna tell y'all what we tell the crowd every night when we play back in the States. We tell them to remember people sleeping in a sandstorm so that we can be free.","I have an outdoor kitchen at home in Georgia, and I try to never eat inside.","'A Pirate Looks at 40,' we had to do that song. I've been covering that forever.","We want to support Nashville, support the community there and be a part of it.","To be a Southern Ground artist, you have to be a lifer. It's not about winning a karaoke contest or a television show to become famous. It's about really paying your dues. It's people I'm fans of and want to help in the business.","It's important that people come see our show, because we are performers. We wanted people to see that.","We just kept going down the road, we kept trying to make the next record, the right choices to get there.","I love to smoke things; there's usually something always in the pot outside. That smell of something in the smoker just reminds me of home.","I've got a couple of Harleys and a couple of Ducatis.","We're really blessed that we've been as well received as we have been."],"Zac Efron":["I wish I could say I see my little brother more. We used to fight all the time but now that I don't see him very often I cherish the time I have with him.","I don't know if I believe in love at first sight, but of course I believe in two people having chemistry right away. A girl should be really easy to talk to. When I lose track of time because we've been talking, I think that's really fun.","I think the most important thing for me in a relationship is honesty.","I'm very competitive by nature. And I like to be the underdog - It's the best way to win. To come from behind and win is a great feeling!","I've grown up a lot, I'm on my own, and I've learned some valuable life lessons.","My dogs are crazy. They're always getting into some kind of trouble... but then again, they're my most loyal friends.","I like to go and do something adventurous. I like to go out and do some sort of crazy activity.","I think every single girl has something different and special about her. You find one who clicks with your vibe.","It's the moms who are overaggressive. A lot of times their daughters are very sweet and cordial, and the moms tend to grab you and scream and want to kiss you. You gotta watch out for the moms.","I think the only real knowledge I had before I went to Iowa was what I learned from 'Food Inc'. But once I got there and developed these extensive relationships with the farmers, I realized that we're basically made of corn.","Spider-Man's probably my favorite. You see, Batman is a billionaire and there's nothing really cool about a billionaire saving the world. But Spider-Man is Peter Parker, a conflicted character who puts on a suit and saves the world. I love that.","A lot of people ask: 'Will you play a psycho to really change your image and prove you can act?' But that's not what I'm about.","I was influenced when I was younger by the cartoon movies that Disney put out, like Cinderella and what not. I watched those movies over and over when I was younger and the music is ingrained into my head. Nowadays, I'm still humming the tunes. It taught me the fundamentals.","Every day is a new experience and I take it as it comes.","I might not be the greatest actor, but I walk into every project willing to work hard.","I think if you're fame-hungry, go out to a nightclub and get drunk... why do that? I don't understand how some people would want fame so bad that they'd go out and get negative attention to earn it.","If I splurge on anything, it's cologne. I love smelling good.","I love action-adventure-type films - mythical adventures like 'Lord of the Rings' or superhero films like 'Batman.'","I bought an electric scooter in sixth grade. Bankrupted me.","If I had a daughter, and some guy came home with her, I'd be on him like a hawk. When I meet people's parents, I know my place. It's not that hard.","I usually spend Valentines Day with my friends. But if I did have a girlfriend, I'd bring her flowers and candy.","Working out is my biggest hobby. It's my Zen hour. I just zone out.","From day one, I got addicted to being on stage and getting the applause and laughter.","Great advice comes from people that have been around a lot longer than you.","In the back of my mind, I can never forget this could be gone tomorrow - and at this point I think the odds are against me... the chances of succeeding in this business are slim to none; there's only a handful of people that have long careers. You have to put in the work, you can never be satisfied, never take it for granted.","In sixth grade, my basketball team made it to the league championships. In double overtime, with three seconds left, I rebounded the ball and passed it - to the wrong team! They scored at the buzzer and we lost the game. To this day, I still have nightmares!","Think on your toes, use what's around you, and come up with something organic and fun.","I can draw really well. And I like to paint. I'm a bit of an artist.","I wouldn't just have other people write songs and me go out and sing it. I would sit down with a guitar and write 11 or 12 good songs for an album and that is gonna take a long time.","We shot 'High School Musical' in eight weeks. I spent longer rehearsing for 'Hairspray' than filming 'High School Musical'.","There's a way that you can throw negativity out there that seems rebellious. But I've always taken pleasure in a different kind of rebellion, which is putting a positive spin on everything, trying to enjoy myself at all times.","I know I've been lucky. But it's what you do with that luck afterwards that really defines whether you stick around.","There are a lot of people who can slide on talent their whole lives; they're just naturally gifted. I've never considered myself one of those people. I enjoy outworking the opposition.","I feel disconnected, like I don't know where I am, if I'm on my phone too much. I'm also just the type to call. I'm not good on text.","I like when a girl knows what she looks like and dresses to accentuate those features.","I'm a guy, but I'm not afraid to cry. Not all of the time. But when I'm watching a movie, I'll sometimes shed a tear, especially 'Moulin Rouge'.","I connect with people on a daily basis.","The awkward thing for me is when the realization happens that I actually might like this girl. Then I become awkward.","A fan sent me a letter and a $10 bill. It's a short letter - all she said was, 'Hey, since it's harder for you to go out these days without getting photographed, here $10 for a pizza.' I was like, 'Aww, she sent me money for a pizza so I could eat at home!'","A girl can tell I like her when I blush or start telling bad jokes.","Amanda Bynes and I have become close since filming 'Hairspray.' It's so weird because I grew up watching her.","Being known for musicals is a great thing.","High School Musical has been a blessing and a gift.","Honestly, if the worst these people can say about me is that I'm gay, then I think I'll be fine. I can handle it.","I grew up being into sports and I wasn't trained to move my body in the right way for dancing. I'm the last one to get any moves correct. In rehearsals it's always, 'OK, one more take for Zac.'","I think it's fine for girls to ask boys out. I actually prefer it.","I wore goofy hats to school and did musical theater. Most people thought I was a dork. But if you have a sense of humor about it, no one can bring you down.","I'll never try to put on a fake image. I'm just Zac.","I've been doing musical theater since I was a kid. And look for a CD from me in the future. I want to write all the songs!","Jesse McCartney is one of the nicest people around. I hate when I hear bad things about him, because anyone who knows him would agree that he's a good guy and really humble.","One time I went into a restroom and a girl followed me in. I signed an autograph for her in the sink. It was pretty funny because she was in a guy's restroom and she wasn't embarrassed at all.","Personally, I was never the cool kid. I was always sort of a bookworm.","The fans make the person a star.","I'm definitely not getting married. In this business, you're either getting married or they want you to be pregnant. I'm not getting married until I'm forty. If ever.","It's weird, but I don't feel like think I deserve any of the attention. There's really nothing but one audition for a Disney Channel movie that separates me from 2,000 other brown-haired, blue-eyed guys in L.A., you know?","Don't get me wrong - I've gone to a club. But I'd much rather be with my close friends at home or a concert, or on a trip. I'll go dancing with my grandma. She likes to cut a rug!","Dating is kind of hard. Like dinner or something like that. Like a forced awkward situation is very strange. Especially for me, for some reason.","Sometimes I take a while to get ready to go out. It's not excessive, but it takes me some time to find clean clothes that match.","A woman called me interesting once, and it kind of blew my mind. She said, 'You're one of the most interesting people I've ever met,' and I was like, 'Wow.'","I've always cared about fashion and what I look like. I don't like to spend a lot of money on designer clothes, but I do like to look good.","I've always been singing. Since day one. I started doing musical theater and you have to sing in musical theater and so that's where I got most of my training. So singing on stage, you just inevitably, when you're around other vocal artists, you get better at singing.","I think if a girl is easy to talk to then that's the first thing I look for. It's great when you meet a girl and three hours later you're like, 'Oh my gosh, we've been talking for three hours, what happened to the time?'","Every time I go to big events, it's a trip. I feel like that kid who shouldn't really be there.","Little Zac had it easy - but he didn't realize he had it easy, so he took it for granted. I think going through 'Hairspray' and other projects helped me learn about the business and life in general.","There's really nothing but one audition for a Disney Channel movie that separates me from 2,000 other brown-haired, blue-eyed guys in L.A., you know?","Without a doubt, I'd love to do Broadway. I actually can't wait to get back to musical theater.","I want to be a well-rounded, versatile performer.","Sometimes, especially when it's cold, I get dry skin, so I scratch a lot. I scratch my arms incessantly.","Right when 'High School Musical' was taking off, one of my little cousins called and was really excited to tell me there was a huge 'I Hate Zac Efron' club at her school. I'm sure they're doing great. More power to them.","I left home at 17 and I've been on the road ever since.","I just want to make great films and be good in them. And I think that my perception of what's great in a film is constantly evolving.","I'm bad at returning phone calls.","You always have something to learn from people who have been through more than you. Be open and receptive to what they know.","If there's a party and they won't let my friends in, I'd leave. No question.","It's not that I'm opposed to doing a big-budget action movie. But it has to be the right project."],"Zac Goldsmith":["Of all the waste we generate, plastic bags are perhaps the greatest symbol of our throwaway society. They are used, then forgotten, and they leave a terrible legacy.","A pound invested in energy efficiency buys seven times more energy solution than a pound invested in nuclear power.","While big business gain subsidies and political access, small businesses drown in red tape, and individuals now risk being classified as terrorists for complaining about it. Economic globalisation is about homogenising differences in the worlds' markets, cultures, tastes and traditions. It's about giving big business access to a global market.","The food system is not a free market. In this country, we impose reasonably high standards of animal welfare - but we haven't applied the same standards to food we import, so all we're really doing is exporting cruelty from Britain elsewhere, and at the same time undermining our farmers.","By uploading 40 years of 'Ecologist' editions online, we will be creating the world's most extensive ecological archive. 'The Ecologist' will continue to set the environmental and political agenda here and abroad.","The two million or so residents who live beneath the Heathrow flight path are accustomed to the noise. However, they are right to feel that any expansion would represent an unacceptable broken promise.","We've all heard of the surveys revealing that teenagers think cows lay eggs, and others where children can identify more brand logos than trees, by a staggering margin. My view is that children will form a significant part of the green fightback. They instinctively understand the value of the environment.","More than half the world's largest 100 economies are corporations. They have no loyalties to place or citizens.","I am cynical about politicians. My experience of politicians has been thoroughly negative. I have found that politicians are people that can not be taken at face value. There are very few politicians I have been impressed with.","I wanted to weave a green thread through the Conservative party; that's my job, and I signed up imagining that I would be in a very small minority within my party, possibly even on my own, battling away on these issues.","'Green' is likely to be a big issue in the 2008 U.S. presidential election - largely in response to George Bush's suicidal refusal to engage with environmental issues.","GM has never been about feeding the world or tackling environmental problems. It is and has always been about control of the global food economy by a tiny handful of giant corporations. It's not wicked to question that process. It is wicked not to.","Sense About Science is much more than an innocent fact-checking service. It is a spin-off of a bizarre political network that began life as the ultra-left Revolutionary Communist Party and switched over to extreme corporate libertarianism when it launched 'Living Marxism' magazine in the late eighties.","We always hear from newspapers that while people understand the environmental challenge, they are unwilling to stomach the solutions. The trouble is, we only ever hear about the solutions from the media, and for whatever reason, they are almost always caricatured beyond recognition. If there's no appetite for green, it's not surprising.","Green policy is about triggering a shift to a cleaner way of doing things. To be effective, it needs to incentivise the right behaviour, for example through tax breaks, and that needs to be paid for by disincentives on polluting behaviour.","If you tell people, 'that old banger of yours, we're going to tax the hell out of it,' they'll rightly tell you to get lost. But if you tell people that when they next buy a car, the tax will be adjusted so that the cleanest ones will cost less and the polluting ones will cost more, most people would say 'fair enough.'","Politicians usually get the blame for dragging their feet on environmental issues. And fair enough. Most of them do just that. But the blame isn't theirs alone. For politicians afraid of losing votes, a bristling media waiting to transform good green ideas into monsters is a colossal disincentive.","All schools should teach children basic cooking skills. Every school should be able to buy sustainable, good quality food wherever possible from local sources. Every school should include food-growing in the curriculum. For some, that will mean twinning with willing farms. For others, it will mean literally building their own small farms.","Anyone driving through London after the school term ends will notice immediately how much easier it is to get around. The school run contributes massively to congestion.","'The Ecologist' has lost money from the day it was launched in 1970, and will continue until the last edition is printed. It was never set up as a business venture. It was set up as a campaign, and like all good campaigns, it costs. Its various backers have, over the years, been happy to pay that cost.","In North America, more than half of all children travel to school by bus. We need a similar programme in London.","Climate change - for so long an abstract concern for an academic few - is no longer so abstract. Even the Bush administration's Climate Change Science Programme reports 'clear evidence of human influences on the climate system.'","More passengers fly in and out of London than any other city in the world. We are well-connected, we have ample capacity, and we are starting from a position of strength. The problem is that we don't use that capacity well.","If we want to preserve Heathrow's hub status, we need to stop clogging it up with point-to-point flights to places such as Cyprus and Greece, which between them account for 87 weekly flights, and contribute nothing to overall connectivity.","The Conservatives are a confusing lot. They first denied climate change was a serious issue and then suggested strengthening the nuclear industry as a solution to it. They oppose the European Union, but support joining North American Free Trade Agreement, despite its obvious failure.","You know I don't really have faith in politicians - this is quite a sleazy business. But there is no law which says that all politicians will turn out to be scumbags.","I do not organize my private life with an eye to my career.","I could just go to the horse races and take lovely holidays, but I have some strong views, and I want to make a difference.","Yes, Heathrow is the U.K.'s busiest airport, but new runways or a new airport are not the answer. It is far better to focus on improving capacity.","The 5,000 or so acres of Royal Parks are one of the things that make London special.","'Green' cannot be allowed to become an excuse for stealth taxes. And nor should 'green taxes' be about punishment. Instead, they should represent a switch of emphasis. So if domestic flights are taxed, it should be on the absolute condition that the money is ploughed into improving the alternatives, such as trains.","Politics colours everything, and anyone who wants change is necessarily political. As an environmental campaigner more or less since I left school in the early '90s, I have always been involved in lobbying, campaigning and pushing for changes.","There are clearly many good politicians who are guided by religious belief, so the mix can work. But there's a line to be drawn. It would be hugely dangerous for a country's laws to be set by the scriptures, and particularly those of the expansionist religions.","Some of the world's most appalling abuses have been justified by religion because it is possible for people to find vindication in their scriptures for any of their prejudices.","Even Karaoke needs higher standards than I can reach, so I have gone great lengths to avoid being bullied into it.","Politicians are so detested. And the main cause is not policy; it's the fact that there is no trust.","I think sometimes if you are too interested in day-to-day politics, you lose sight of the long term.","I don't know David Cameron very well. I like him. I think you can judge a book by its cover - whoever said you can't is wrong - that's the whole point of nature giving us intuition, instinct and so on. I think the cover is pretty good.","I can't be bought. I don't need to be bought. I'm not a careerist. I don't need to have a career in politics. I'm in a very, very luxurious position, but I am in a position of strength.","If there was a time when 'The Ecologist' appeared not to be making a difference at all, not doing something useful, I wouldn't do 'The Ecologist,' but I think it is useful.","Europe believes that providing clear labelling for genetically modified food is a consumer right, but such practice is absolutely opposed by the vast majority of states in the U.S.","A number of countries around the world, and indeed the E.U. as a whole, have chosen not to allow the import from the U.S. of beef from cows fed a diet that includes the hormone ractopamine, because of the fairly grave health concerns.","Leonardo DiCaprio is a rare phenomenon. Whereas for so many celebrities an interest in the environment is a fashionable accessory, for DiCaprio it is a thread that runs through everything he does."],"Zac Hanson":["It's cool to have critical success because it's always nice for your peers to say, 'Good job.' But who cares about them?","The real reason we ended up getting into that type of music was our dad worked for an oil company so we spent a year overseas when we were young kids. Because of that, it was all Spanish TV and radio so we ended up having these '50s and '60s tapes, tapes of that music.","It would be nice to have radio support, not that we've ever had that much trouble with it.","It's pretty much run by everybody. We're very involved in everything that goes on. We always have been.","You may be pulling from different influences because of different things that are going on in your life, different people that are around you and more experiences to pull from."],"Zac Posen":["I'm not a chef. But I'm passionate about food - the tradition of it, cooking it, and sharing it.","At the end of the day, you can't compete with Mother Nature. If you've got a great tomato, just a pinch of sea salt is all you need.","Don't worry about what's cool and what's not cool. Authenticity is what's cool.","I want to make things of quality. I'm a big believer in handmade, tactile, crafted pieces. I want to keep that tradition alive.","I believe that creativity is an important human experience and element in the same way as sleeping, eating, having sex.","Fashion has a dark side - it's not all runways and lipstick and fishtail gowns.","When I was little, I had a Norwegian babysitter - and that was my introduction to both regular and salty licorice. We all know the ordinary version, but the salty kind is a favorite candy throughout Northern Europe. It's a guilty pleasure of mine that I have to try not to keep around because I'll eat the entire bag in one go.","Chefs have the ego of an actor and fashion designer combined.","Fashion is killing women's body image of themselves.","People who devote themselves to a life of style are admirable.","To me, being in fashion is about your work, not about facilitating a lifestyle.","I like films that probe emotional questions and inspire you to get creative and get writing, get draping, painting, cooking, whatever that thing is where you have that kind of output.","There's nothing wrong with being pretty.","Creative burnout and physical burnout is real. I mean, there are moments when I get home - after overseeing, you know, almost 16 collections a year - where I can't move.","I go online at night and I order flowers, rare flowers, and then they come in the mail. That's my fashion detox.","Beyond fashion, I think that culture has a side where they love to shoot you up like a clay pigeon and then take out their rifles. I lived that, and I got to see the perspective from up in the sky.","Everybody wants to be a star right now, to be heard, to have a voice, so you have to give the confidence for people to have that ability - and give them the wardrobe to become a star.","If you're entering into fashion in an original way, you have to know your craft, and you have to know your history. You have to be obsessively dedicated. You have to be relentless about making it happen. It doesn't take a bank. It takes passion, love, timing, and luck.","When you make and drape clothing, the scissors are your tool. What can I say about them? They're my babies. And you have to take care of them correctly. You have to have them sharpened, and you can't use them for any other material.","Some of the best kitchen discoveries come about through total kitchen disasters.","With Zac Posen gowns, it's like making an ornate pastry. Then, sometimes, it's just great to have the perfect chicken soup or consomme. And that's Brooks Brothers.","Food is everything. Food, friends, family: Those are the most important things in life.","I truly believe that you can't be a successful business unless there are hiccups. That American mentality of picking yourself up, brushing your shoulders off, and then really going for it makes you 100 times stronger and smarter.","The biggest thing politically within fashion is that the clothing should be displayed on different body shapes.","I don't believe in one ideal beauty.","Listen, I'm not a rich kid. I'm a cultured kid; I'm very rich in culture.","So many people are following fashion now. It's become fashion-tainment.","I want to be a major force.","There is no reason for me to show my collection in New York, because it's not about craft and technique there.","I am a compulsive and concise shopper.","I am totally unattached to material items.","Taking sartorial risks and not following other people is what makes you stand out.","I'm quite a tuxedo junkie, I collect them all year round.","I have so many fashion mistakes, but that's part of being in fashion. I think the people that you see make the most mistakes are usually the best dressers.","There's not one major greatest influence on my career. It would be film and great artists and great imagineers - Jim Henson, Walt Disney, Charlie Chaplin, people who understand the joy of the imagination.","I love creative people.","I started cooking out of middle school depression.","New York ladies all look immaculate.","I have a garden, and I collect different heirloom seeds from different neighbors.","One of my goals and dreams is to work in film in the future.","To me, the more dialogue amongst creative types, the better. It keeps people on their toes, and competition is healthy.","You can't market or commercialize feminism as an entity. One has to be careful. I aim to be about powerful women in my clothing.","I have multiple lines and am licensing multiple projects, but I am still hands-on. It feels special. I don't take it for granted.","To be able to buy a plant and plant it, that's a luxury to me.","I'm a SoHo born-and-raised kid. So my parents dragged me to lots of museums, and for birthdays and any kind of celebration, we'd go to the theater.","At the end of the day, you're not defined, I don't believe, by your financial means. That doesn't make you a better person or a smarter person.","One of my fantasies is to produce 'Auntie Mame' as a play.","Fashion is a pay-to-play game; this is an industry. At a certain point, you must bridge a gap where you are supporting the reviewer, the publication, and that is very real.","I try to be the best that I can be and the best to the people that work for me.","I feel very fortunate that I make everything I wear head to toe every day.","I always end up in the kitchen at restaurants. At events or parties, too, I like to see where my food is prepared or made. I like the theater of it.","I don't cook ribs in my own home. I let my dad cook the ribs. He's from St. Louis, Missouri. I like to use a grill, but that's my dad's domain.","Authenticity from a person and product is absolutely essential.","The first time I went to the Met Ball, I was 16. I was an intern there and saved up to buy a staff ticket to the party. That was my favorite experience going. It wasn't the red carpet; it was the experience of being there for the first time.","As a designer, I'm not interested in trend.","I'm interested in the opportunity that people can self-create using social media and the online dialogue. Before social media, you needed to have a lot of personal funds to break through to hire the right people and build a presence to start a line. It gives the opportunity and platform for people to be discovered.","I was very interested in theatre, so my first love of fashion comes from costume, and I think that's pretty clear within my work and the level of theatricality.","When I first got to Brooks Brothers, my mom told me she remembered how upsetting it was trying to find professional clothes in the eighties. Suits would either be over-stylized or frumpy, so she said, 'Make sure it's tailored properly.'","I garden in my Brooks Brothers pajamas and straw hat.","There's a reason good fabrics have a cost. They're done with good quality to last.","I think, mind over body, it's real.","There are issues that are being questioned that are fundamentally upsetting to me, deeply: immigration, funding for the arts, Planned Parenthood, and women's rights. These are just issues that are very close to my heart, and I use my own private voice and funds to fight for them and in support of them.","Since the beginning of my career, I have publicly dressed and represented women of all sizes, of all colors. And that's a big part of who I am and what I want to give to the world.","I try to push design boundaries using new draping and fabric manipulation techniques every time I approach a new design.","The most significant pieces for me are the ones that come from my drapings. It's emotional because they are created by my hand and then become a collaborative process in the atelier.","The practice of patience in crafting and process is a virtue that needs to come back.","I like to vegetate when on vacation given my busy schedule when I'm at work.","I cherish my time off and the solitude that comes along with it.","I don't wear flip-flops, so my casual shoe is a Brooks Brothers tuxedo slipper!","When I'm on the road for fashion shows, I love room service. I think it's one of the greatest things in the world. I usually like to keep it simple with soup, but my big indulgence is French fries or chicken fingers.","I am a Florenz Ziegfeld fanatic.","A great trick for frying is to put a popcorn kernel in the oil, and when it pops, you're ready to fry.","I eat everything, but I moderate; I try to be semiconscious. I don't eat pasta every day, although people who follow my Instagram think I do.","I think it's really important to try to eat seasonally as much as possible. It helps put people in touch with what's happening locally and with nature.","I personally love grilling, but it's a 15- to 20-minute commitment in entertaining.","I was not a young fashion victim. I really had an idea of what I liked in fashion and how I dressed.","I'm definitely planning ahead for a brand that spans the universe - a Zac Posen universe.","I went through the workroom at Central Saint Martins in London, which is the most competitive workroom of a design school in the world. Very high creativity, very conceptual, very international, age-diverse and cutthroat - people who have master degrees reapplying into a foundation there is just wild to me to launch their careers.","I was born and raised on 'Singin' in the Rain.' It's in my work. It's in me.","I just think when you are dressing a celebrity, for me, I'm hopefully adding a moment. I always say, 'What role do you want to play?' when we start a fitting.","For me, I'll unwind at the end of the day by soaking in Epsom salts. It's the routine I prefer for coming down after crazy days.","There's something very old-fashioned and luxurious to have a pair of pants and jacket made to your needs and measurements.","I'm a pretty controlled and disciplined person, but my real vice is buying plants and food shopping.","I have to bring my A-Game 24/7, between creating, draping, and overseeing a myriad of different brands.","The way I cut my clothing... it is about empowerment and loving the curves of the body.","As a designer, I always want to put out to a larger public. I truly believe that all bodies are beautiful, and that's what makes our world exciting.","Sometimes, late at night on the set of 'Project Runway,' I've been known to pop an interpretive dance.","As a little boy, my mom would bake with me on the weekends - that was our time together.","Obviously, I like very beautiful food, because I think as delicious as food has to taste, it also has to look very beautiful - the process of presentation is very important.","I think that maybe growing up and being dyslexic early on, the visual quality of cookbooks specifically was something very enticing to me.","As an object itself, to me, books today are such a rare entity - I want mine to be something where, if left on the kitchen table, a child could pick it up. It can visually tell a story.","As one grows their company and brand, you have to learn to be a leader, and there's no formula."],"Zach Anner":["I've accepted that we've all got crap to deal with and problems that we're fighting not to be defined by. At the end of the day, we all want the same stuff: fulfillment, love, support, comfort, and a hot-air balloon with laser guns attached to it. The most important thing is that we appreciate the crazy ride we're on.","People tend to treat people with disabilities sort of like they're aliens from another planet. It doesn't come from a bad place; it comes from a place of, 'I have no idea what this disability entails, and I don't want to offend anyone or make them feel awful.'","Spontaneity is what travel is all about.","Humour allows people to exhale a little.","It's amazing how many companies aren't really in tune to the needs of different travelers. There's just so many embarrassing situations that you go through when you travel. You have to have a sense of humor about it and take it in stride. My whole approach is to embrace spontaneity.","My best advice to anybody who has a child with a disability is to really find the tools for that person to thrive and find what their true passions are, because the rest will follow.","Talking to people is important to me as someone who has cerebral palsy. I know what it's like to have people not talking to me because they are scared they would ask the wrong question, but I would rather have an honest dialogue as long as it comes from an honest place.","Religion is something we don't talk about, and it is used by uneducated people as a weapon to divide us as opposed to connect with each other.","Most people are really dedicated to doing good things.","I'm not saying 'I have cerebral palsy, pay attention to me.' We all have problems, and we have to figure out how to live our best life.","Over the years, I've learned that a sense of humor is the only skill that allows you to turn sucking at life into a career.","We've all got hurdles we have to overcome, and mine are not necessarily any bigger than anyone else's.","My grandmother was a church organist, but we only went on Easter and Christmas Eve sometimes.","I'd love to be 'People Magazine''s Sexiest Man Alive, but I think that that's a ways off. I have to stop wearing sweat pants, and then we'll work on that.","I'm down for adventure and up for anything.","My childhood was great because my family has an amazing sense of humor, and it was just all making videos and jokes and doing skits and things.","My parents instilled in me a sense of self that I was more than just a diagnosis or a condition.","For me, cerebral palsy wasn't the biggest deal, because I always had it. You know, you always work with what you got.","I was basically the person at Disney World that was in charge of clearing the park when it was closed... I was the guy... telling them to 'get the hell out and have a magical day.'","When I get real excited, my muscles go into spasm, so they just shake.","I'd wanted to be famous for as long as I could remember.","When I was five years old, I auditioned for the role of 'Tiny Tim in A Christmas Carol.'","The only two characters I can play convincingly are myself and a dumber and sweeter version of myself.","Over the years, I learned that in my career, unlike in life, sometimes my wheelchair is its own automatic door opener. I was able to win the OWN competition by applying one simple principle: be funny, and admit you suck before anyone else can call you out on it. In other words, make the narrative of your failure a comedy.","The Internet is crazy, and I love it!","New Yorkers - the people are so honest. If you're sucking on stage, they'll let you know.","This country is pretty amazing.","My stance has always been that my issue compared to everything else going on in the world is really, really small. Once you realize that, you can get a lot more out of being a part of the solution.","Even the most embarrassing mishap can be spun into comedic gold.","I've been a comedian, hosted travel shows, explored world religions, started improv troupes, given keynote speeches at conferences around the country, and had a milk shake named after me called the Handicappuccino.","There's no denying it: I was a crappy baby who failed his way into this world, and I've been making the best of it ever since.","I use an electric wheelchair because I have no sense of balance, and muscle spasticity has arched my spine like a cat's, while my legs are really just for show.","I don't subscribe to the idea that if you don't have the body you want, you can't be proud of the body you have. I think you can do both.","I think you can feel good about yourself at any size and any shape. Nobody should be made to feel inferior because they have a certain body type.","It's ridiculous that we are in a place where we feel like we can classify and dismiss certain groups of people just because of the way they look, or we have these standards of health - like, cellulite is something you need to get rid of. No, it isn't. It's just a part of people's bodies.","My family is weird in a very good way because I was always exposed to the arts.","I want to find a way to speak to the broadest audience possible.","Religion is such an important part of so many people's lives, and I don't understand it at all.","My parents and my brother instilled in me my sense of humor. That's kind of the way we communicate with each other, and it's always been a way for me to get to know people.","Depending on where my self-confidence was, growing up, I would use humor either to bring people closer, or to keep them away from certain feelings I had.","Humor disarms people. It opens them up to starting a dialogue about things they wouldn't normally talk about. I don't understand how people who don't have a sense of humor get through life.","Even when something sad or tragic happens, I find a way to look at it in a positive light. People who don't have a sense of humor must be so sad all the time.","I have one of the worst voices in the history of recorded time.","My grandma was a church organist for 40 years, and she got me into jazz music and great songwriters, Harold Arlen, George Gershwin, all those folks. I can't do it, but I have a profound respect for it.","When I got my Oprah money, the first thing I bought was a really nice electronic bidet toilet seat.","I've always wanted to do a travel show for people who never thought they could.","A lot of the time, when people meet someone in a wheelchair, or with some disability, it's the first thing they notice, but they don't know how to react.","I want to make sure that people know that I can only be myself - I can't be a spokesperson for people with disabilities, because everybody has a completely different experience. I'm glad that I'm able to inspire parents to see one way to deal with it, but at the same time, I tell a lot of dirty jokes.","When people think of me, I want them to think of a travel show host who's really funny and good at his job, and I think eventually the CP won't even play into it, or at least that's the goal."],"Zach Braff":["My mother's a psychologist, my stepfather's a psychologist, my stepmother is a therapist and my dad's a lawyer. So it was all prominent in my life. I don't know anyone who doesn't know someone on some form of prescription medicine.","I'm hanging out with my New York friends, my Jersey boys, my family and loving every single second of it.","I always liked the story of Noah's Ark and the idea of starting anew by rescuing the things you like and leaving the rest behind.","The best way to travel abroad is to live with the locals.","In theater or movies you see either 'I'm religious' or 'I'm an atheist.' I've never seen too much discussion of 'I believe there's a higher power but I'm hesitant to reach out to him because I don't know if I'm worthy of his attention.'","I procrastinate so much and I get distracted by anything.","Everyone has an idea that they think would be a great movie. Everyone has a cousin who they think you should work with.","I am really driven, but my drive doesn't affect the conversations I have in my head about life, and worries and fears and insecurities.","I am really driven, but my drive doesn't effect the conversations I have in my head about life, and my worries and fears and insecurities.","I think I felt compelled in a way because if I hadn't written the part, I never would have been offered the part. There are at least 10 guys who would have been offered the part before me.","I came when I was in high school as part of a student exchange program with the Jewish Community Center in New Jersey, to Ramat Eliyahu. You come and volunteer for five weeks at a day camp. I was a teenager - I couldn't really appreciate it as much, and now I come back as an adult and I can really get the flavor of the city, and I love it.","I have a great relationship with my parents. I have not been on lithium.","I'm by no means condemning prescription medicine for mental health. I've seen it save a lot of people's lives.","That image is a couple different people's homes that I knew growing up.","The way I write is that I'll actually have a conversation out loud with myself. In a weird way, I just kind of get schizophrenic and play two characters.","I didn't necessarily have a total idea when I was writing the movie of where everything was going. I just wanted to have really realistic dialogue and write like people I knew talked. I tried to keep it very real.","Actually when I gave out the script, I gave it with a CD of all the music I wanted to put in the movie, and again, we never thought we'd get all that music.","It used to be that you came out of school, and you got married - those who were going to get married. But my peers are getting married in their early 30s, so now there's like this extra 10 years of that angst.","I said, I'm on this TV show and I love doing it, but I don't want to be known always as the silly 'Scrubs' guy... So part of me was like, You know what? Life's short. Let's go for it.","Gay men in L.A. are all a bunch of tens looking for an eleven.","I was kosher until I had my Bar Mitzvah, and I parlayed officially becoming a man into telling my father I wanted to eat cheeseburgers.","Everyone has a warped vision of Hollywood and what success in Hollywood is like.","In fifth grade, we had to write a story and read it in front of the class. When I read mine out, the class were just belly laughing. And I remember being like, 'This is the coolest!' So I want to dedicate my life to trying to make people laugh. I can't imagine doing anything else.","They put all this money into these huge films and then no one goes to see them. That sort of shows they're out of touch. Then everyone in town passes on my little movie and it does really well.","I love 'Scrubs.' It's the best day job in the world.","I want to take piano lessons, I want to study at university, I want to travel, I want to do other parts, make another movie.","I know every politician spins the truth a little.","I think I suffer from some mild depression.","I don't care about image and all that nonsense. I'm in sweat pants every day. I don't play the game at all.","I think in a play it's wise to just sit back and watch other actors and be able to shape it from the audience.","I'm a person who likes these sort of movies... sad but moving 'art movies' that normally are at a festival and then they go to a small art house theater and disappear.","I think a lot of people are drawn to seeing people that want to be better. We see it in ourselves.","I'd always fantasized about writing a new play. Even when I had all this success in television, what I was daydreaming about in my dressing room is that one day I would do it.","I'm putting myself out there in a way I don't know if I ever have before.","The success of 'Scrubs' allowed me to pursue anything I felt passionately about without having to worry about money. It allowed me to spend my summer work shopping my show at a nonprofit theater.","When we shoot 'Scrubs' I spend every waking hour of my life in an abandoned and haunted hospital. All I can date there are ghosts and they tend to be horrible snugglers.","I love music and I love musicians and when I hear something that's great, I always say it's like you go to a movie and you can't wait to tell your friends about it.","I have no desire to make money off musicians. I just want to promote them because I want to share music.","I really like just super dry comedy.","I had no interest in sports so I didn't make friends in that traditional way where kids are in public school and they go and they join clubs, and play sports. So I kind of had to find my own way to make friends and get attention and so I just was the class clown.","I had a very funny family.","I went to film school and wanted to learn everything there was about making movies.","I'm sure lots of actors and creative people go through this, where you have some weeks where it's all going according to plan and some weeks where you're super frustrated.","As a kid who wasn't into sports, at school I felt almost alienated at times, whereas in the theatre community there was this amazing sense of camaraderie. Early on, we would go to rehearsals with my dad and I was like the mascot for the backstage crew. That was a big part of my childhood, so I dreamed of one day doing a play in London.","Ever since I was little it was programmed into me that London is where great theatre occurs and all the big shows you love start there.","I always encourage over-tipping if you can afford it because... share the wealth.","In New York, we tip everyone. We tip doormen, we tip cab drivers, and we tip bartenders at the bar. You'll get quite an evil eye if you don't leave a tip at the bar."],"Zach Cregger":["It is not weird for a dad to be doing the dishes, the laundry, and taking the kids to school, and read them stories for bed.","I think a generation ago, dads went to work, they came home, and they had their dinner, had a drink, and then went to bed. I don't know what it was like in your house, but that is how it was in mine. I think it is cool to have the dads in the trenches and doing the real parenting work.","I adore doing comedy, I think it's fantastic. I never saw myself doing exclusively comedy."],"Zach Galifianakis":["I get burned out on standup. But I like acting. I do like it. But sometimes you just feel like a monkey. You just feel like a complete tool. But I like it. I do like it. Stand-up is just more free. A lot more freedom because you just do what you want to do.","I try to write three jokes every day. I don't sit down and write them, it's just things that pop into my head. Then I'll go watch it fail onstage that night.","I like dark comedies. That's why I like the Wayans Brothers.","Some people can be choosy because they're ultratalented or lucky or whatever, but yeah, there are certain things that might not be the greatest thing on my resume. But I don't sit back and go, 'Gosh, I wish I didn't do that.' It's all part of the growth of a career, whether you're an entertainer or a librarian.","Inappropriateness is funny to me. Rudeness is hilarious.","I have a 60-acre farm in North Carolina, and I have a tractor and a farmhouse. As soon as I groom the land, I want to put cabins around and have a place where people can write and hang out. It'll be either that or an all-black nudist colony.","My dad doesn't get any of my jokes. He laughs at them, but he doesn't understand them. He's just laughing because people around him are laughing.","I kind of put myself out there as is. I'm a quiet person. I don't know if that's surprising. I'm a Pilates junkie.","I'm Greek. My body produces feta cheese.","My name is Zach Galifianakis and I hope I'm pronouncing that right. I'm named after my granddad, my middle name. My name is Zach Granddad Galifianakis.","I would have changed my last name if being famous were my goal.","When I was in high school I used to sit by myself in the cafeteria - not necessarily by choice - but I thought it was funny to talk to people that weren't there.","I talk to younger actor types, and they bring up that word, 'brand,' and it's like, 'All right, if that's the way you want to look at yourself.' Diet Pepsi's a brand; you're a human being.","There's more to life than being an actor in a Hollywood movie. I'm not going to adapt my life after that existence, where a lot of people do. And they get the publicist, and they get all that stuff, and it becomes them. I think it's a stupid way to live your life. A really dumb way to live your life.","Hollywood's built on insecurity. People are trying to prove things. And I probably have that. I probably do. Probably guilty of it, in a way.","I am going to be the next Ryan Gosling.","A good stand-up, you lead the audience. You don't kowtow to the audience. Sometimes the audience is wrong. I always think the audience is wrong.","That's one of the great things about comedy: we can - and should - say the things that other people aren't supposed to say. If we didn't do that, if we didn't push against those limits, we'd just be standing around onstage and yelling.","When I do stand-up for a long time, I'll get burned out, then I'll get an acting gig. For me, the grass is always greener. I'd like to do a mixture of all of it. My goal is just to do small movies that I've written. That's what I'm trying to do now, just write smaller movies.","That show, 'The Amazing Race' - is that about white people?","I've been happily dedicated to the same woman for a number of years. I never even look at other women.","We all know how funny Morrissey is. Actually, you know what? I say that sarcastically. His songs are some of the funniest songs I've ever heard in my life. I mean, really. I mean, not that the 'Girlfriend in a Coma' is, like, really funny.","You know, sometimes if you work - if you do a lot of takes and you work long hours, for me, at least, there is a delirium that starts kicking in on the fifteenth hour, and that can help. Below the just thirteenth hour is where I have a concern, because everybody's so tired.","I think comedy does have that powerful thing that doesn't seem too preachy because you're also making people laugh, so it's really kind of a good tool for messaging.","I don't like cursing in movies. I feel like cursing has become the new hackiness. You try to find substitutions for cursing.","As a comic, it's anti-comedy to be known. I think a lot of comedic actors get lost in this world of Hollywood and all this stuff. They lose what brought them there in the first place. I'm very trepidatious about it.","I just try to keep myself a traditionalist. I liked being an underground comic doing my thing. I want to maintain that. I just do.","Privacy is big for me. To do interviews even, I have a very love/hate with it.","Actually, I used to be a busboy in a strip joint in New York and so I hate strip joints. I'm not that kind of person.","My real last name is Galifianakisburg.","There was a long time where I was an 'artist' in quotes, who had no money. But I guess back then I also never had a girlfriend.","The congressmen and senators used to go have a drink in D.C. They would disagree all day long, but they would find that time to sit down and learn about each other personally. I think that's totally wiped out; I don't think it really exists anymore.","I am not into publicity. I'm not good at it. I get anxiety about it.","I wish I could sit back and say, 'Oh, I'm gonna wait for a Merchant-Ivory film to come my way. Or Ivory-Merchant. Whatever it's called. But you just take what's given and then, hopefully, down the road you can be more choosy and only do, say, Wayans brothers movies. That's my goal: to be more Merchant-Ivory-Wayans.","People get TV deals by doing something in their grandmother's basement. It is definitely the wave. Everybody is trying to do all that stuff. I mean, the Internet is the only reason that I've gotten work is because I've somehow created a line and people have seen it. And then I've been asked to auditions.","My forte is awkwardness.","American society loves to prop people up and then take them down.","It's not good for comedy to be like, 'Thanks for liking me.' Being popular is poison.","We talked about politics constantly in my family growing up in North Carolina. There were always debates. Being of Greek background, it's in our blood to drink coffee and talk politics.","I'm not versed enough in constitutional law to run for office. I'd have to go back to school or something.","Whether you are on the Right or the Left, everyone can agree that there are a lot of outside influences in American politics that are not good for the system. There's just too much money.","I understand Tea Partyers' anger with the system, but they are in way over their heads and often racially motivated, and I can't be part of that.","When a role seems fun it's easy to play. It kind of comes organically.","I haven't been hit since Leon Spinks hit me in '92.","Fat jokes to me are always, always hilarious, as long as they're done towards yourself.","I used to be really cute. I could send you earlier photos where I'm stunning. But I've gained about twenty pounds over the past two years, and the more weight I've put on, the more success I've had. If you drew a diagram of weight gain and me getting more work, a mathematician would draw some conclusions from that.","I think if they put a laugh track on 'Intervention,' it would be funny.","Reciting lines is hard; making stuff up is much, much easier.","Have you seen that show on Lifetime about that woman...?","I'm terrible about people wanting to take pictures with me. I'm a giant baby about it. They treat you like a cartoon. There's nothing you can do except make light of it. That's if I'm in the mood - sometimes I get superbummed.","I've been wanting kids for 10 years. I'd love to adopt, have them naturally - all of it. I want, like, 15.","I can get away with anything. But when I try to be sincere, people just roll their eyes.","Comedians paint ourselves into corners all the time, and tastes in comedy change. The guy in 'The Hangover' was a really fun character to do, and it was easy to do. But you have to find other things because audiences will let you do that for a little bit, and then they're like, 'What else do you have for us, monkey?'","As you get older, you see the world at a different angle, maybe more cynically, but I just bury my anger.","A fantasy of mine is to do a podcast that's Marcel Marceau and I, and you only hear me laughing at him and trying to figure out what he's doing."],"Zach Galligan":["Some people have a blog that's, like, 'Today I brushed my teeth.' Well, who cares? Who cares that you brushed your teeth. Okay - you brushed your teeth! That's so massively egocentric, it's just ridiculous.","L.A. is a very strange place. On the surface, it has an innocent appearance, like the stranger with the pleasant face that smiles and shakes your hand. But then you learn it is actually a lot less nice than you think, and there's a whole deeper, darker level.","If you put up a blog, people can cut out the middle man and get material to you. Which is really helpful because a lot of time there's really cool stuff out there that we just don't see. Because, y'know, the agent is acting in our best interest, but it does sometimes prevent some of the good stuff from getting through.","I love England and I love English culture, particularly English pop culture.","If you stop and think about who was in the 'Lassie' movies, it's difficult to think who was in them, apart from Elizabeth Taylor. You remember the dog, not the people! So if you're going to be in a movie, and it's called 'Gremlins', it's going to be about Gremlins, and what people are going to remember are the Gremlins.","Three years is a lifetime in Hollywood. If your career starts slipping in L.A., you can really feel it. All of a sudden, the people that you were beating for a part start beating you.","I had a blast in the '90s, perhaps too much fun, and maybe I should have worked a lot harder and partied a lot less, but I definitely don't regret the 12 years I spent living out in L.A.","River Phoenix and I were friends for nine years, and I watched him grow and mature, and I also saw him struggle. I watched him deal with the whole up and down aspects of Hollywood and saw him bounce back, so when he passed away, it was such an enormous shock.","There's no substitute to actually being in the room and having people in the room feel the force of your audition. It's very hard to beat that.","After 'Gremlins' came out, I should have packed up everything, moved to Los Angeles from New York, and dedicated myself to being a full time film actor. I had the world at my feet.","Before 'Gremlins,' I was a normal person, then within two weeks of the movie coming out, I couldn't walk into a store without people turning around and staring. It's exciting and also scary because everyone starts telling you how amazing you are.","I knew a ton of actors and was friends with them, but I never dated actresses. I tried to date 'normal' people because the Hollywood dating rule is 'one star per couple' because it's quite a challenge to match the egos of two actors.","What drives that desire to destroy Paris Hilton? What drives that desire to venerate Angelina Jolie? I do understand it, but it still baffles me. It baffles me when people treat me specially and differently, because I just want to look at them and go, 'What are you talking about? I'm just a person.'","The people in New York want to achieve something; the people in L.A., they just want to achieve success.","You have to determine what you are and send the messages out to people, like, 'Hey, I'm a screenwriter - look at this.' You can't sit around, wondering why people aren't calling and asking about my writing.","Discovering L.A., in particular in the early '80s, was pretty spectacular; it was fun and carefree, and there was not nearly as much traffic as exists today. It was very much the last gasps of the Beach Boys' ideal view of L.A.: sun, the beach, cars, blondes, etc.","I think one of the reasons 'Gremlins' lasts and some other films don't is because I don't think the movie has a whole lot of dated things - sure, the cars, my hair, and few things here and there that date the movie - but it takes place in a sort of everytown, in a sorta non-specific time, and that gives the movie a timeless quality.","The gremlins are clearly the ones have the most fun in the film, trashing the town, going to the bar, smashing things, etc. It's all gleeful chaos, which makes the movie fun.","Being on a lunchbox was awesome, and being on a thermos was pretty cool, too.","I have a complicated relationship with the horror genre. I love it; I loved it as a kid growing up, and I watched Chiller Theater in New York. So I loved it, but then you do feel if you do it too much, you're stuck there.","I saw Tom Cruise at every audition I went up for, and he was a friendly go-getter back then. You gotta remember, in New York I would go up for something, I would sit, and in the room would be Matthew Modine, Matthew Broderick, Andrew McCarthy, Tom Cruise, and Kevin Bacon.","Kevin Bacon and I went up for the same stuff, and people would say, 'You and Kevin have the same quality.' I was like, 'I do?' I remember seeing 'Footloose' and thinking, 'How do I have any kind of quality that that guy does?'","I like to work all the time and really immerse myself in the project.","You don't get as invested in someone in 90 minutes as you do over 13 hours of television show.","I was never really acting. I was not taking it seriously. Acting was very much a hobby for me. It wasn't really until I was finishing college and doing it sporadically that I began to take it seriously.","An actor is working steady if he's active four to six months a year."],"Zach Gilford":["I never had any film training. I went to Northwestern. I studied education and theater. So it was all theater training.","There is a little bit of me in every part I do... I'm not really good enough to completely construct an all-new character.","I'm compulsively on time. It drives me insane when people are late.","I used to like the word of the day and when I read, highlight words that I didn't know and look them up.","I hate when a movie just sort of ends and is so open-ended you feel like it wasn't finished. I appreciate leaving things up to the interpretation of the audience and letting them make decisions about where things will go in the future - but the director has to make a decision; otherwise it is sort of a cop-out.","I really have no preference between TV and film. I think that each individual project is its own thing and has a very different style.","I wanted to be an actor when I saw the movie 'Die Hard.' I saw Bruce Willis shooting guns and blowing stuff up, and I thought, 'I wanna do that.' It really had nothing to do with acting; I just wanted a job that allowed me to do fun, bigger-than-life stuff.","I think my strength is always been in being very natural. I think Shakespeare and things like that would be more a stretch for me."],"Zach Johnson":["I'm a foodie. I enjoy it a lot, and contrary to what it looks, I eat a lot. My comfort food, of all things, would be southern soul barbecue.","Goal setting will never stop. I will continue to work hard and practice hard and see where things go.","Whenever I'm in Des Moines, I always make a trip to Manhattan Deli for a sandwich. I spent a lot of time there when I was going to college at Drake, so it's usually my one 'go-to' food stop when I'm in town.","Winning the 2007 Master's was a dream fulfilled; culminating on Easter Sunday with my family was very special. You couldn't write it up any better.","When I'm off the golf course, and my wife and I have free time, which is not very often, we really enjoy movies. I'm a movie nut; she might even be more so. Holiday in our house is the Oscars.","If I'm trying to rebound after a bad hole, I just go back to tempo and process and rhythm, and I cling to my routine.","Some people thought I'd be on the PGA Tour, that I'd win tournaments, play in majors, contend in majors, win majors. I thought they were crazy.","I have no superstitions. I don't have to have a Sunday outfit. I don't have socks or underwear I have to wear.","I just see myself as an athlete and a competitor, someone who just works really hard at trying to get better at golf.","I'm kind of a grinder. I'm a Cinderella, an underdog story who fights.","Elmcrest CC, in Cedar Rapids, is where it all started when I was growing up. The tree-lined course has a very demanding layout that requires you to be accurate off the tee and avoid a number of well-placed water hazards on some of the holes.","You need to make a trip to Des Moines in August, because the Iowa State Fair really is a sight to see. The Iowa Fairgrounds are usually packed for those 11 days, and you get a real sense of what a classic Midwest fair is all about.","There are a bunch of places to stay in Des Moines, but I'd suggest finding a place on the west side of town. It's a great urban area that has a lot to offer tourists.","I've got a great support system, starting with my wife and family, to my agent, my instructor, and my mental coach.","When you're trying to accomplish lofty goals, and when you're attacking something of great magnitude, you have to have help.","I'm a Christian guy, and when it comes to my priorities, it's the utmost. For me, just to calm myself down, to keep my perspective when I'm playing, to not make too big a deal of it... that's where I go to. The peace that comes with that allows me to play free golf.","I've come a long way since 2007 when I kind of launched my golf career.","I play golf for a living. I'm grateful for that. It's a beautiful game, provides a great opportunity.","I feel like God gave me the ability to play a game. I try to take it very seriously. I realize it's just a game.","I don't know if I have a brand. I just see myself as an athlete and a competitor, someone who just works really hard at trying to get better at golf. I guess I'm kind of the feel-good story who's seen every level of professional golf.","Sports formed me. I was always decently skilled but lacked size, so I had to resort to using my skill versus my power. I strategically play golf because that's all I can do. It's the same on the basketball court. I try to get open and shoot it. Or I use the open space on the soccer field.","I like to look good on the golf course.","Golf is not my priority. I would hope people see me as a Christian man who loved his family, who loved being in the heat of competition and sometimes succeeded at it; who understood that golf was his job and that he was very lucky to play it for a living.","I discovered what it meant to 'live for Christ,' and that it honestly was something I wanted to do. The facts were there, and I could sense the Holy Spirit at work.","Early in the winter of 2002, I gave my life to the Lord. Before I was one, I always thought being a Christian would be boring. In reality, it has been the complete opposite.","I like to play what I call a-motional golf. Emotion doesn't grab me that much.","I had good skills, but my lack of size and speed kept me a little behind the best kids in the other sports. Golf offered a more level field. I would have rather played other sports, but golf picked me.","If you put me in the fairway at my average distance into a par 4, 175 to 180 yards, and you put another player in the rough 120 yards from the green, over time, I'm going to wear him out.","My boring, mundane, diligent kind of golf works sometimes. Actually, it works all the time. And sometimes, on the greatest stages, it really does flourish.","I don't hit it very far; I don't overpower a golf course, but I think I'm a pretty decent putter. At Augusta National, putting is premium.","I'm not the most charismatic, maybe emotional, fun-packed individual on the golf course; I get that.","To win at Augusta and to win The Open Championship at St. Andrews, it's hard to put it into words as a golfer, as an athlete, as a guy - I'm not rich in history, I can tell you that. I'm not a great historian.","These guys that take a shower, grab a cup of coffee, and go straight to the tee? That's not the way to do it. When you warm up, hit 20 to 25 wedges, a few middle irons, and 10 to 15 3-woods and drivers. If you're going to putt, give yourself 10 minutes.","Try to devote the percentage of time for each club that you're going to be using on the golf course. I like to have two or three different clubs that I practice with, not four or five.","I don't hit it as far as a lot of guys do, so I have to be in the right spot in the fairway to score, and that means driving it well. The two biggest keys for me are to make a good transition and to keep my hands ahead of the clubhead through impact. I want to feel as if my swing is two swings: one going back and another coming down.","The Zach Johnson Foundation, for my wife and I, is very much a part of what we do and why we do what we do. It's a great platform for us to give back to the community that started me in the game and other communities.","I like boring golf. That's kind of what butters my bread."],"Zach LaVine":["There are going to be good days and bad days... and you have to learn to fight through that.","Lunchtime and recess, that was a big part for me growing up. I think it's important for kids to have that.","It was a big-time change, coming off the bench.","You have to handle adversity well. There are roadblocks you will have to fight through.","I'm not the best at video games, but I play them a lot.","I've been on my grind to be the best player I can.","A lot of people I've played with see me as a scorer and a shooter. I'm still fast and everything like that, but then, when they see me dunk, it's like 'Oh, damn.'","Lunch was my favorite part at school.","I feel like I'm supposed to be a shooter.","I've never seen hard work fail.","When I was younger, me and my dad used to do different things. I don't think I would call it community service. It was more just us doing nice things. We used to donate to Goodwill or do can drives. Give people money if they needed it. Little things like that.","I have the highest goals for myself. That's going out there and being the best player on the floor every time. That's my mentality. If it's Michael Jordan, you know, that's the mentality I take to the court.","I usually start my day with a light breakfast of fruit and eggs and take granola bars with me to eat after practice. Lunch and dinner usually consist of chicken over pasta or rice and beans.","Michael Jordan was that guy - he was Michael Jordan. So whatever he did, we followed.","I just have a connection with sign language. I always thought the deaf community was a different community to be a part of. In high school, me and my friend took sign language.","I can't drink anything but chocolate. I don't even like any milk but chocolate. When I eat cereal, I barely touch the white part.","Some people may have their doubts about me. But I feel like there's no shot too hard for me to take.","I feel like I've accomplished everything I could in the dunk contest. It would be hard for me to go back and outdo myself.","There's so many different styles to it. I use my athletic ability to create shots for open people, I run the floor, then also space the floor as well. That's what I try to do.","I'm very humble.","My ultimate goal is whenever I go on the court, I just want to be known as one of the better players.","Kris Dunn is a very athletic point guard.","I've always been taught that hard work doesn't fail.","Every year is pressure. You need to put in on yourself to go out and perform.","I'll forget what day it is sometimes. I have to look in my calendar every once in a while.","I grew up playing basketball and baseball. I've always been active because my dad played professional football, so sports and working out have always been a part of my life.","If I wasn't a pro-athlete, I would probably eat any dessert dish every day!","Watching game film motivates me a lot. It shows me what I need to work on and determines the specific workouts I do.","Let's just say the genes were there for me to excel athletically.","I never thought I'd be an actor.","I've never been a shy person. I've always been able to talk pretty well.","It's always good to be known. You want to build your brand up, want to build your name.","I feel like people who know me, my fans, I want them to know I'm just a regular 21-year-old kid who likes movies, who likes to have fun. It lets people see the other side of you and not just the basketball thing.","I remember when I was in third grade, I was in a classroom, and the teacher said, 'What do you want to do when you get older?' We were going around the room. I said, 'I want to be a professional basketball player.' She's like, 'That's not realistic.' I thought to myself, 'OK, watch.'","My dad, Paul, is, like, my best friend.","My mom, Cheryl, worked two jobs to support me. She really helped the family stay together.","Kobe Bryant has always been my favorite player, and he was drafted No. 13, too, in 1996.","I just feel like whenever the team needs a bucket, I can come and get it. I feel I'm a really good scorer.","I have confidence in my game. I can get up and run the floor to the best of my ability, and above all, I'm going to play my hardest.","I have really high expectations for myself, so I just want to go out there and compete.","You can never take a day off, because there's an All-Star on every team.","I went to a lot of college camps when I was younger... You just admire those players because they're at a higher level than you at that time.","I can create for others.","I put Tabasco sauce over everything. Or I put it on pretty much anything that wouldn't taste gross - I mean, I wouldn't put it on salad, but I like it on fried chicken, nachos... a lot of stuff.","If I get to spoil myself, I'm going to DQ. I always had it growing up, so I stick to it.","I like to get a salad or fruit in me - just some good energy food - and then a plate a pasta with a breast of chicken.","I always had confidence in my game.","I'll always have something to prove.","I love the game of basketball. I guess it started with 'Space Jam.' Right after that movie, I went out there to my little Flight hoop and tried to do every dunk in the movie.","I played point guard my whole life.","I feel comfortable with the ball in my hands.","While taking sign language in high school, one of our assignments was to go out and participate in the deaf community, so I really got to know a lot of the group from that. I felt like they needed a little bit more of a voice because people treat them different just because they're hearing impaired.","I don't want anybody to feel like they're different.","I know everything about Michael Jordan.","I've made a lot of game-winners.","If I have a bad shooting day, my dad will take me to the gym.","I've always been a very confident person, and I know how important it is to take advantage when life gives you opportunity.","I try to let my game speak for itself.","There are a lot of critics out there, a lot of people that you want to prove wrong. But that's what your hard work is for in the offseason, spending hours and hours in the gym.","I always felt like I'm a good one-on-one defensive player.","If there are negative people around me, I just try to distance myself from that.","I know where I want to get to, and I know where I want to be still in my career.","In high school, we used to sign to each other during the game, signaling different plays and stuff like that. It was kind of fun. It was definitely unique.","I'm not going to change my game because I got hurt.","Regardless of what the record is, what the score is, you always go out there and compete.","You never know what's going to happen. In a game where you're down by 20, you're still trying to win the game.","You go into each game looking to win. We're not looking at wins or losses because it proves something as a team. We go into every game trying to get better. As long as you compete, we're gonna play our hearts out; we're improving every day.","LeBron's one of the most freaky athletes of all time.","Sometimes you have to understand your place.","I've always felt I had the ability to be a good, elite defender in this league on the wing. I just need to lock in. I feel if I pick that up, I can be a very good all-around player.","My main thing is I'm going to compete on every play, try to be focused on both ends of the court. That said, I'll always bring my excitement, my swag, to the game.","I like to prove people wrong.","I will forever be proud to call myself a Bruin and will never forget the memories that were made here.","You're on your own in college, but you get sheltered a little bit more with the coaching staff and everything.","Taxes suck. They really stink.","I had no clue about taxes at all. I didn't know they hit your paycheck. There's something that you've always got to put money away for. I didn't know you've got to put money away for it, even though it's coming out your own money. It's like, 'What the heck?'","I just try to attack the rim as hard as I can. Try to get the crowd pumped up a little bit.","I've always been able to shoot the ball, so it's just about continuing to work on your shot and shoot the ball. That's the main thing. Got to get those shots up.","I try to space the floor and use my athletic ability to get to the rim... I try to get the best of both worlds.","I play baseball - 'The Show' - a lot. I'm pretty good at that. I go 'Road to the Show,' where you build your own player. I build myself when I used to play as a center fielder. Power, speed, stealing bases.","You have to communicate with your teammates; you have to be on a string. There are a lot of things that go into a play. And then you are guarding a two or three, which is probably one of their better players on the team, so you're focused on them.","You look at Kawhi Leonard, Tony Allen, Draymond Green: they are great on ball, and they are great team defenders as well. You want to be both of them, not just one.","We want to be two-way players; that's the best thing.","I always want to improve.","I pride myself on definitely being more than a dunker.","I've always thought I was talented.","I feel comfortable whenever I step on the floor.","Whether it's backing up or starting, I have the confidence to go out there and do good, so I'm gonna play my role."],"Zach McGowan":["My father and his brothers and sisters were childhood Irish jig champions in the Bronx. At our family celebrations, they all get out and do the jig. And of course, the younger generation, me and my cousins and my brothers, we have our own Americanized renditions of the Irish jig, which is a bit more like 'Lord of the Dance.'","'Cold Case' was fun. It was a fun experience. That was right when I was cutting my teeth as a TV actor. It was a great learning experience to work on really fast-paced television shows that are very high quality. It was a place where I learned that I had to keep up and I could keep up.","Acting is equal parts talent and perseverance.","As you do on any cable series, if they introduce you as the villain, then you better start working towards making him a really good guy, or if they introduce you as a really good guy, then you better start working towards being the villain. Your character has to go somewhere, or else they become very uninteresting.","My father is a Marine. My brother is a Marine. I almost became a Marine. I'm no stranger to fight training. I used to do jujitsu and boxing as a kid. I was a running back in football for my high school and my college. I played ice hockey as well as did theater. So, there's always been a physical nature to me.","Fight scenes are hard, no matter what you do. You're trying to make it look like you're hurting someone without hurting them. It doesn't matter how big and strong the guy is that you're fighting or how small and feeble someone is that you're fighting. You don't want to hurt them. You're working with them.","I think with every part you do, you become a better actor. I've learned from my experiences on that.","When you play a character, there are choices you have to make about the past, the present, the future, etc. You have to make those choices on your own a lot.","Every time you do a big sword fight surrounded by a couple of hundred extras, it's a fun day at work.","In reality, I've always been an actor - since I was a kid. I did theater growing up in New York. I was always in the plays in school. I was either going to be an actor or an athlete or a soldier. Those were kind of the three paths that I always kind of embarked on.","When I moved to Los Angeles, I was cooking with two guys who became celebrity chefs, if you will. I became their sous chef for awhile. We'd go to all the big names in Hollywood.","I pack on mass quickly when I lift."],"Zach Roerig":["My family had a business where they worked with gravestones, and I remember growing up and playing in cemeteries like it was a normal playground.","When I was 17, I decided I was going to leave home.","I keep dumbbells in my trailer, and I work out between takes.","I rode horses since I was a kid."],"Zach Wamp":["When you know something in your heart, you better not be quiet about it. You better speak out about it.","I really believe deep in my soul that we're going to have to step up and face these challenges and be tough and pull together and unify and be creative and be willing to sacrifice.","Because these kids get away from their parents, and they binge drink until they are sick. Dozens of them are going to the hospital, and some of them dying. This is a problem, a big problem that needs to be addressed, and we need accurate information.","I know it starts at home, but all families are not staying together.","Frankly, alcohol leads to a lot of other things when you start drinking at 12-years old. It is a big problem that needs to be addressed. Frankly, the industry has pushed us back and pushed us back.","I believe the National Park Service has demonstrated strong partnerships geared towards respecting the private property of citizens in its administering of the current Trail of Tears National Historic Trail and will continue to do so upon the addition of the routes.","Republicans in Congress boosted the economy by cutting taxes and ending programs that don't work.","The pro-growth policies and spending restraint of Conservatives work.","We can not underestimate the potential harm North Korea's capabilities can cause for the rest of the world.","The U.S. along with China, Japan, South Korea and Russia has an important role to play in containing North Korea's nuclear ambitions and exerting all the influence we can possibly exert.","And I am a conservative. Sometimes conservatives forget we are supposed to conserve, to save, to be efficient. Plus our dependence on other sources of energy is causing our country to not be independent and to really be vulnerable. So this is a security issue.","Before I begin talking about the threats we face, the vulnerabilities that we have, and frankly the courage of the men and women in uniform that stand in harm's way on behalf of a very grateful Nation, let me first honor the sacrifices of September 11.","For twenty years, Islamic Jihadists have been attacking American interests around the world and we did not take them seriously until September 11th, 2001.","Over this August district work period, like many of my colleagues, I spent a lot of time with the men and women in uniform from my home State. The 196th Field Artillery Brigade just got back from a year in Afghanistan.","But Hezbollah now has reared its ugly head in a way that threatens the entire free world. And they want, by their own charter and definition, the destruction of Israel and Christians. That is the truth. That is in their charter.","That was one of the great successes of removing Saddam Hussein, as we took Iraq out of the picture of having a sovereign nation from which the terrorists could operate. But this war has not gone perfectly.","Those are serious questions of war and peace, of freedom or tyranny, whether or not there is ever going to be a hope of us instilling some democratic systems in a part of the world that frankly is breeding hate and destruction directed right at us.","Today the people from my State of Tennessee would listen to this debate, or even talk about a reference to God on our money or in the Halls of Congress or in our Pledge and say, please, let common sense and logic win the day and prevail versus legal mumbo jumbo.","In closing, let me just thank God, on the floor of the House, for not turning away from us even though we seem to be turning away from Him.","We must curtail the flow of illegal immigrants across the Mexican border.","Failure to properly control our borders costs citizens in many ways: schools become overcrowded, medical resources are stretched too thin, other government services are overtaxed, and taxes increase further.","Hamas, also elected to governmental leadership in Palestine, includes the jihadists, people who have declared war on the United States of America and its ally, Israel.","If we pulled out of Iraq tomorrow, Islamic jihadism is on the rise. And they continue, as we see in Lebanon, to seek to destroy the State of Israel and seek to drive America back and bring us to our knees. We must stand tall and straight.","Now, the United Nations is an organization that I believe was founded with good intentions. As a matter of fact, a prominent Tennessean named Cordell Hull was very involved with it."],"Zach Woodlee":["I have so many photos of me where I'm laughing like a crazy person. I don't know what it is, but I just go with it.","In general, I tend to laugh too much. I always try to tell myself not to, but I think that's just part of getting through the job. It's not rocket science. I want to have a good time!","I can't even tell you the anxiety I get from being around those cameras!","Once I can verify my account, I will have a Twitter."],"Zach Woods":["I've played a lot of characters who are creeps or weirdos, with a deep darkness underneath the surface.","If I'm doing comedy, I try to improvise a lot. Even if they don't use it, it helps me loosen up and figure out the character.","I think that if you're improvising on TV, it's a great way to help the dialogue between actors and writers.","Sometimes you'll see people give performances in comedy with an ironic detachment where they'll sort of be remarking on the character from outside of it. They're sort of commenting as they're playing the character. I think it's hard not to do that. I've certainly done that.","Sometimes you read pilots and, understandably, they're doing such a frantic tap dance for approval. I get why - it's such an incredibly competitive market.","When I was a kid, I wanted desperately to be a jazz musician. I would practice the trumpet for hours, but when I got braces, that messed up my ability to play, so all of a sudden I had all this free time.","By the end of high school, I would do shows at the theater at night and then take the train home and go to school the next morning.","When improv is bad, it's excruciating to watch, and to be involved with it is a unique type of torture.","I'm a very anxious person, and it's hard for me to be in the moment. Improv demands that you be in the moment."],"Zachary Gordon":["When I was about four, people used to walk up to my mom and say I should be in commercials.","I'm not a wimpy kid at all. I don't care what other people think - I only care what I think about myself.","I love retweeting things and seeing how many fans are on other people's pages.","Zach Galifianakis is hilarious. I worked with him on a pilot before; he's hilarious and such a nice person.","I've always wanted to go to Australia. I hear it's a great place. I mean, kangaroos are pretty awesome. That's an up factor."],"Zachary Knighton":["'FlashForward' was a really fun show to make. Not to mention, I only worked, like, one day a week, and it paid the same as 'Happy Endings.' I got to make out with beautiful women on that show as well.","V-necks are great because you can get a little fat and you still look kind of good - and I like to get fat sometimes, so it's nice. I like to fluctuate between the world of skinny and fat, so V-necks suit me well.","I don't want to name any names, but I've worked on television shows where there's a guy writing for my generation who's, like, 60 - and it doesn't work.","I've done comedy, and I've done drama. I've sort of been a journeyman in my career so far.","'Big Bang Theory' is not my kind of show. It's not my humor. I don't like multicam comedies. I don't want an audience to tell me when to laugh.","In college, I won the Irene Ryan; it's kind of like a collegiate Tony, which got my career going. I was honored. I won a fellowship to the Kennedy Center, and that's where I got my agent.","I thought I was going to be a theater actor. I moved to New York after college and did some plays and worked a lot. Once the realities of living as a theatrical actor hit me, I realized I wanted to start making a little bit of money and not have to bartend and work in theater.","You know, I've just always been sort of goofy and kind of gone with it. I actually usually work more in drama, but I have been floating back and forth with comedy, and somehow they keep giving me jobs in comedy, so I guess there's something funny about me.","Film work can be tedious and sort of all over the place, especially when you have a family and you're going off and doing things somewhere else.","I surf - that's the one thing I make time to do. I definitely surf a lot, but when you're working 15 hour days... all I want to do is get home to my baby.","I mean, comedy's hard. If you go back and look at the first season of 'Seinfeld,' it's a work in progress and that's what happens. It just takes time for people to figure each other out, and figure out timing, and to develop creatively with the writers.","After high school, I went to VCU and got a B.F.A. in theater. I got to do a bunch of stuff professionally throughout college. I actually got my SAG card in college.","'FlashForward' was a dream come true. I had auditioned for David Goyer for 'Blade: Trinity' and didn't get the part, but I guess he became a fan.","'FlashForward' was on the outs when I was approached with 'Happy Endings.' I literally got the script on a Friday, and on Saturday morning I met with David Caspe, Jamie Tarses, and the Russo brothers. I took the role on that Saturday, and on Monday I was doing a table read. It all happened very fast, but it was super exciting.","At one point, I was in a place where it didn't feel like it was going to happen, and I was feeling pretty down on myself. But I stuck to it, and now I have a hit comedy on my hands. You've got to keep plugging away at it. If you really believe in yourself, you can definitely make it happen.","I can tell you, if you shoot in the rain you're going to have a lot of voice ADR to do after the movie and voice looping, stuff like that."],"Zachary Levi":["Being nerdy just means being passionate about something, including everyone - the coolest people on Earth are passionate and therefore nerdy about something whatever it is, whether it's sports, or gaming, or technology, or fashion, or beauty, or food, or whatever.","'Aladdin' was probably my favorite Disney animation when I was a kid. The animation was great and Robin Williams was unbelievable as the Genie. 'Aladdin' was an amazing adventure and the lead character was a hero for guys, which I loved. It wasn't a princess or a girl beating the odds; it was a street rat. That seemed really cool to me.","Oh I've done bungee jumping. Skydiving, I have motorcycles that I ride. I'm a little bit of an adrenaline junkie in that way.","I'm totally a geek.","I could probably give you a list of a dozen pet peeves I have about my own physicality and why I couldn't get a second date.","On a personal level, I love the idea of hosting an awards show. I think that sounds like kind of a fun thing to do.","There has been a kind of stereotypical 'gamer dude' that has been representative for the gamer community in the years past. But I want to spearhead or be a part of changing that.","If I have my way, I want to go start making really interactive television. Stuff where you can sit and watch real actors do a real series and they can get into some kind of gun battle and all of a sudden your television prompts you to pick up your controller and all of a sudden, you're playing a first-person shooter.","If somebody says 'singer-songwriter' to me, the first person I think of is James Taylor. There are plenty of modern singer-songwriters, but there is something about James Taylor that has always resonated with me.","I think that 'Family Guy' is hysterical. It's edgy and hip - and they can do whatever they want to do because it's animated and they're not limited by budget.","My high school experience was pretty good, but my middle school experience was god awful. It was horrible. I got picked on like no tomorrow.","My whole background, my whole life was just lots and lots of theater, a lot of that being musical theater.","I believe in conscientious capitalism; that's a kind of driving force with me.","I don't believe in strong-arming people.","I believe in incentivizing people. If you can incentivize people in anything, whether it's in politics; in life; in spirituality; in business; just take care of folks. Incentivize them and all of a sudden it's amazing the difference that you'll see.","Entertainment has this way of resetting itself.","I believe that as an entertainer, you're only as good as your audience and the people who support you.","I get a lot that people have a hard time believing that I'm a nerd... but I grew up with a Nintendo controller in my hand.","I want to go create my own independent content and entertainment, in new models and in new ways, and essentially show studios and networks that people are good.","Fans will treat something preciously if they're given the opportunity to do so.","Films are really cool because, every couple months, or however many times you can get a job because there's a lot of luck involved in that, you're playing a different character.","I started in theater, and I love to go back to theater, just to have the experience and recharge my batteries, creatively.","I'm a huge Disney nut. I have been since I was a little kid.","You know, Hollywood is a very interesting town - always has been, always will be.","There are a lot of people who consider themselves 'spiritual,' but that can mean a lot of things to a lot of people. I don't really talk about it that often, because there's too much talk in the world. Especially with Christians, there's more proselytizing than there is actual living proof of it. That's kind of sad.","People don't talk about religion a lot in Hollywood because it's not an incredibly safe place to do it.","A lot of people, especially Christians, want to put you in this box of being a Christian actor, and I don't believe in it. You do yourself and everyone else a big disservice when you start thinking about it as 'Christian art.' That's why most Christian art is bad. They don't put a premium on the 'art.'","I'll watch a Pixar movie over and over and over again. I'll be with friends of mine who have kids, that want to watch 'Finding Nemo,' and I'm like, 'Yeah, okay, let's watch 'Nemo' again, for the seven billionth time!,' because they're amazing movies.","I mean, I like to consider myself a reasonably athletic guy.","I'm a 'Lost' guy, I love 'Lost.'"],"Zachary Quinto":["Our society needs to recognize the unstoppable momentum toward unequivocal civil equality for every gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgendered citizen of this country.","Gay kids need to stop killing themselves because they are made to feel worthless by cruel and relentless bullying.","My desire to be valued is manifested in cultivating relationships with my friends and family.","We are witnessing an enormous shift of collective consciousness throughout the world. We are at the precipice of great transformation within our culture and government.","I try to be as fearless as possible. I don't always succeed, but I like to think I try.","I believe in the power of intention to change the landscape of our society - and it is my intention to live an authentic life of compassion and integrity and action. Jamey Rodemeyer's life changed mine.","Every time I get on an airplane I have a routine. I cover the inside of my nostrils with anti-bacterial ointment. I'm popping Zicam like it's candy. And I drink, literally, from L.A. to New York, six bottles of water.","I would love to be a voice in this maelstrom of chaos and obsessive celebrity infatuation that says, 'Let's talk about something that matters'.","It is my intention to live an authentic life of compassion and integrity and action.","Other actors are not my concern, and that's their life and that's their journey. Everybody has to get to a point in their own time and their own way.","Again, as a gay man I look at that and say there's a hopelessness that surrounds it, but as a human being I look at it and say 'Why? Where's this disparity coming from, and why can't we as a culture and society dig deeper to examine that?' We're terrified of facing ourselves.","The interesting thing about my character Sylar is that my strengths as an actor seemed to go completely against the shape of a character in the shadow.","I just find that there's something about looking back on interviews, whether for purposes of remembering what I said about something or if it's for posterity when I'm 75.","I came up during the 'Star Wars' generation and that was sort of the thing I plugged into much more. It was a little before my time and I think it was sort of grappling with these intellectual ideas that were a little advanced for my young mind. At the time. But now I have a much deeper appreciation for it.","I don't really approach a character as to whether or not it's good or bad. I just approach a character as to where it lives in me.","'Heroes' really changed the game for me in a way that nothing before it had.","Parents need to teach their children principles of respect and acceptance.","We are at the precipice of great transformation within our culture and government.","I recognized that I had a window of opportunity that had opened because of my exposure as an actor.","I'm a big believer in the notion that our greatest potential lies in our darkest parts. To a certain extent it's only in facing those parts of ourselves that we can truly grow, and I think that's true of all of the characters I've played, certainly in the past few years.","I don't immerse myself in the Internet chatter because it opens you up to a whole source of danger.","I think it's like, you know, you can't get ahead of yourself, because no amount of success or exposure or opportunity is going to really matter or be ultimately fulfilling unless you can be totally present in what you're doing right now.","I love when you aren't accountable to anybody or anything, and you can just be wherever you are.","What scares me? Oh, now that's a big question. I don't know what scares me - cockroaches, nuclear apocalypse. Fear is an interesting thing. It has a place in all of our lives. I try to be as fearless as possible. I don't always succeed, but I like to think I try.","I find that communication as an actor and person is an important part of who I am. And I'm really drawn into the psychology of those dynamics.","It became clear to me in an instant that living a gay life without publicly acknowledging it is simply not enough to make any significant contribution to the immense work that lies ahead on the road to complete equality."],"Zachary Taylor":["Never judge a stranger by his clothes.","As to the Constitution and the Union, I have taken an oath to support the one, and I cannot do so without preserving the other, unless I commit perjury, which I certainly don't intend to do. We must cherish the Constitution to the last.","My wife was as much of a soldier as I was.","It would be judicious to act with magnanimity towards a prostrate foe.","I hope some compromise will be entered into between the two parties, slavery & antislavery, which will have the effect of allaying violent passions on both sides.","As American freemen, we cannot but sympathize in all efforts to extend the blessings of civil and political liberty, but at the same time, we are warned by the admonitions of history and the voice of our own beloved Washington to abstain from entangling alliances with foreign nations.","I did not expect to encounter what has beset me since my elevation to the presidency. God knows, I have endeavored to fulfill what I considered to be an honest duty, but I have been mistaken; my motives have been misconstrued and my feelings grossly betrayed.","I cannot in any case permit myself to be brought before the people, exclusively, by any of the political parties that now so unfortunately divide our country, as their candidate for office.","I have always done my duty. I am ready to die. My only regret is for the friends I leave behind me.","Soldiers, I intend to stay here, not only as long as a man remains, but as long as a piece of a man is left.","My duty to the army and to the republic whose battles we were waging forbade me assuming a position of seeming hostility to any portion of the brave men under my command.","For more than a quarter of a century on active duty, my house has been my tent, and my home the battlefield.","In no case can I permit myself to be a candidate of any party or yield myself to any party schemes.","Economy I consider a virtue & should be practiced by all; there is certainly no way in which money can be laid out than in the education of children.","If elected, I would not be the mere president of a party - I would endeavor to act independent of party domination and should feel bound to administer the government untrammeled by party schemes.","I know enough of the family life of officers. I scarcely know my own children or they me.","The idea that I should become president seems to me too visionary to require a serious answer. It has never entered my head, nor is it likely to enter the head of any other person.","I will not say I would not serve if the good people were imprudent enough to elect me.","I have never yet exercised the privilege of voting, but had I been called upon at the last presidential election to do so, I should most certainly have cast my vote for Mr. Clay.","The confidence and respect shown by my countrymen in calling me to be the Chief Magistrate of a Republic holding a high rank among the nations of the earth have inspired me with feelings of the most profound gratitude.","The appointing power vested in the president imposes delicate and onerous duties. So far as it is possible to be informed, I shall make honesty, capacity, and fidelity indispensable prerequisites to the disposal of office, and the absence of either of these qualities shall be deemed sufficient cause for removal.","I congratulate you, my fellow-citizens, upon the high state of prosperity to which the goodness of Divine Providence has conducted our common country.","In reference to the Army and Navy, lately employed with so much distinction on active service, care shall be taken to insure the highest condition of efficiency; and in furtherance of that object, the Military and Naval Schools, sustained by the liberality of Congress, shall receive the special attention of the Executive.","In all disputes between conflicting governments, it is our interest not less than our duty to remain strictly neutral."],"Zachery Ty Bryan":["I'm just a person who forgives and forgets. I have a hard time holding grudges.","Well, when you get into the business, what you have to realize is that signing autographs and getting 'bothered' is just part of the deal. It's not a bother to me at all. That's part of being an actor and that's something you have to realize before you ever get into this business.","I don't miss acting at all.","A lot of people try to paint this child actor stigma, but I always looked at it as a great opportunity.","I had phenomenal parents. They kept me very grounded, and I lived a normal life."],"Zack Greinke":["To wake up when the sun comes up and enjoy that and then, when the sun goes down, to have a nice property or house where I could watch it on my porch when I'm older. It would be peaceful.","I don't mind people looking at me. That's never bothered me. I don't want them looking at me in my house; now that would bother me.","There definitely will be flying cars, but whether there'll be flying cars for most people to use, it'll probably take a long time to straighten everything out, all the rules and hassles. It'll take a while to figure out how to keep people from crashing into each other.","To talk to people, I have to spend energy talking to them. If I expend my energy on talking to people and making friends, it takes away from the energy I could focus on getting ready to pitch.","I'm not a good liar. I just tell the truth; I think that's the best way.","Brad Pitt has something about him to where he's played different characters in all his movies, and every single time after he's done, I want to be him.","You're not allowed to write about me if you haven't seen 'The Shawshank Redemption.' See it and then get back to me.","I don't want people following me around, everywhere I go, people talking to me and stuff. I don't want to be walking down the street with a bodyguard. I don't think that will be an issue playing in L.A.","I don't like to just talk about nothing, or less than nothing. If it's something interesting, I'm fine with it, but, 'Hey, Zack, how is your day?' People ask that, and somebody actually tells them what happened in their day? I don't have any real interest in that.","I used to get so nervous and upset at stuff... I'd always be angry.","I remember bringing some of my other friends to our table, and everyone at our table would look at them and ask me, 'What are you doing? Why'd you bring him?' It was annoying high school stuff that still goes on now. My high school was really bad.","I could play for the worst team if they paid the most... If the last-place team offers $200 million and the first-place team offers $10, I'm going to go for the $200-million no matter what team it was.","It's not easy to play 162 games and be focused the whole time. It takes a lot out of you.","If I lie, I forget what I said the first time. I won't remember the lie. I don't know how people do it.","I don't know anyone who likes the American League games better. Maybe some fans do. But if you're not an actual DH, you probably prefer the National League.","Sometimes my arm wants to throw a hard fastball, but my brain doesn't want to throw it that hard.","There's more people to ignore in New York or Boston than there are in Milwaukee, but I would still ignore them, probably.","Baseball, in my opinion, would be a lot better if you could just make the same salary as everybody else in the world, and you don't deal with any of the other stuff. But that's not how it is. The main thing is I want to pitch against the best players in the world, and you can't do that playing in a pickup baseball league in your town.","I don't play anymore, because I know I'm not going to be a pro golfer. So there's no reason to golf.","I feel like, in general, lefties hit fastballs from right-handed pitchers better than right-handers hit fastballs from right-handed pitchers.","I don't really think about the runs too much. I mean, if we get, like, a five-run lead, then I'll start to pitch according to that.","I've only kept one award in my whole life, and it's the coolest thing ever. Mizuno gave me a samurai sword for winning the Cy Young. It's awesome.","Everyone watches everyone pitch. If they're doing good, you're trying to take something out of them. I've taken something from probably every average to above-average pitcher I've ever played with - what they do. You see what they do and how you can put that into your game.","That's our goal every year, to win the World Series, like it is at most places. In L.A., it really is.","In Kansas City, most of the time, if we'd have made it to the playoffs, we would have been happy. But our team wasn't that good.","I play to see what I can accomplish. I don't play for fun. I play to see how good I can be."],"Zack Snyder":["He's this amazing ambassador for all superheroes. What we've made as a film not only examines that but is also an amazing adventure story. It's been an honor to work on. As a comic book fan, Superman is like the Rosetta Stone of all superheroes.","Twenty years ago my parents wouldn't know who the X-Men were, and now everybody knows that stuff. It means that deconstruction of the superhero is something you can do. All those movies have led to a point where we can finally have 'Watchmen' with a Superman character who doesn't want to save the world and a Batman who has trouble in bed.","I believe that pop culture is just, like, so ready for 'Watchmen.' We tried so hard to ride that wave between satire and reality, and all the things that make you still care about the character, but you don't miss the commentary about them.","Of course it would depend on the project, but I don't think I could ever separate myself from my aesthetic.","I love the irony of movies. I really do. For whatever reason, I'm incredibly intrigued by the irony of reality in a motion picture.","The eyes get lost in 3-D. With 3-D, your eyes are looking for the plane of focus, right? And the problem is, when you do quick cuts, your eyes can't find it.","I think I just have a natural operatic aesthetic. I can't help it.","Music has that ability to be a magical thing, and I was like, maybe music is the vehicle that transports us to that other world.","The thing about owls is that they do sort of have this facial disc, which is unlike any other bird. They kind of have a face, more than like a dog or a giraffe. They have this weird, alien face that you can actually make expressive.","The problem is, when you're making an animated movie, the studio has an illusion in their minds - and it's really not true - that because it's a drawing, it can be changed at any time.","My mom always encouraged me, it was never weird. She'd look at 'Heavy Metal' and go 'Woo-hoo!'","'Watchmen' is like the music you feel is written just for you. 'That's my song, no one else gets that but me.' That's why the fan base is so rabid, because they feel personal about it.","The difference between 'Watchmen' and a normal comic book is this: With 'Batman's Gotham City,' you are transported to another world where that superhero makes sense; 'Watchmen' comes at it in a different way, it almost superimposes its heroes on your world, which then changes how you view your world through its prism.","I understand the rules of Superman - not necessarily better than anyone else - but better than a normal filmmaker would. After doing 'Watchmen' and digging that deep into the why of superheroes, when Superman is presented to you, I felt like I was in a unique position to say 'I get this guy. I know what this is.'","The challenge with 'Watchmen' is making sure that the ideas that were in the book got into the movie. That was my biggest stretch. I wanted people to watch the movie and get it. It's one of those things where, over time, it has happened more.","People always come up to me now and say, 'Watchmen' is the best superhero movie ever made.' I'm always saying 'That's super cool. That's nice of you to say.' But it happens now, more and more and more than it did when it first came out.","When I make a live-action movie, it's a very physical process. It's like running a marathon.","I write in a pretty straightforward way. I kind of sit down at page one and start writing.","We tried to approach this as though there's never been a Superman movie before, but at the same time respecting the canon and mythology. There are the pillars that you have to respect, and I'm not about to break them. But it is fun for me to bend them and mess with them.","I heard one time that the Superman glyph is the second or third most recognizable symbol on Earth after the Christian cross.","One of the things I think is important about 'Watchmen' is that it have resonance within cinematic pop culture as well as superhero culture.","You know, it's a hugely difficult thing to take any work of art or drawing and say 'make that real.'","I always say, I'm certain I changed 'Watchmen' less than the Coen brothers changed 'No Country for Old Men.' I'm certain of it. But you don't hear the Cormac McCarthy fans, like, up in arms about it. They should be. It's like an amazing Pulitzer Prize-winning book.","The thing about 'Dark Knight' is its objective is to set Batman into your world, so that you can imagine the moral dilemmas he faces are exactly parallel to moral dilemmas that you would face in this world, today, if you were out there fighting crime dressed like a bat.","I'm interested in animation. I actually feel like I've learned so much about the process how to make an animated movie.","It's interesting now that basically a CG set is the same cost as a real set. So like if you're going to build a CG house in the suburbs, it costs you $200,000. And if you were going to build it in a computer, it'll cost you $200,000. It's the same... the relationship is exactly the same.","I mean, like, I can go in a room and say, look, 'Watchmen' should be at least 15 minutes longer than 'Batman.' I mean, that's, like, any geek will tell you that.","We do like digital projection. We like shooting on film, finishing digitally, and projection digitally. That's what I like best. It's still a movie. It's not someone's camcorder and it got projected. That's mean, I know.","Origin stories are really important to me. I just like that sort of stuff and I feel like it makes a lot of sense to the guys, who they are. If you don't have that stuff, it's kind of a one dimensional version of it.","There's very few dork movies made by dorks.","To go back, the mistake that Universal Studios made with 'Dawn of the Dead' was that they didn't have enough money or cared enough to make a soundtrack.","Our plans for 'Superman?' I can't say. This is the most super secret thing ever. It's like working for the government, like I'm on a covert mission.","I think that, for me, Superman just seemed to make a lot of sense to me. After doing 'Watchmen,' it was - you know that thing, you've got to know the rules before you can break them? There was something about that in making 'Watchmen.'","It's more like Christmas, you know, when you get a shot in that looks great and it's exactly what you want. It's a great feeling, and there's nothing like it.","I mean, it's weird because people lately have been coming up to me and going, 'Oh, my God. '300' is huge.' I'm like, 'Really? It's not done yet!'","We've tried to make a Superman movie where he does stuff and you go, 'Yeah, if I was Superman, that's what I'd do.' Even though he's an alien, he's more relatable, more human.","We didn't shoot in 3-D. They've talked about doing a conversion and there's been a lot of talk about us doing 'Sucker Punch' in 3-D, but I'm still waiting to see.","It's difficult to find a movie that feels true to itself. You feel the hand of Hollywood, the moviemaking by committee, on everything."],"Zack Space":["I'm running because we need change.","It starts with campaign finance reform.","I am looking forward to working with Congressman Hobson and Vorys Advisors to help Ohio businesses and organizations achieve their goals and objectives."],"Zack Wamp":["Thank you for the sacrifices you and your families are making. Our Vietnam Veterans have taught us that no matter what are positions may be on policy, as Americans and patriots, we must support all of our soldiers with our thoughts and our prayers.","We should not be afraid to go into a new era, to leave the old beyond.","Recruitment and retention are critical to sustain our Armed Forces with the best men and women willing to stand in the gap and make huge sacrifices to ensure our freedom.","One of the greatest men to ever walk this land was Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. His life exemplified unity by bringing people together for the good of all. In any small way I hope to someday bring people together like Dr. King.","Agriculture was the first manufacturing industry in America and represents the best of all of us.","With only 2 percent of the world's proven reserves of oil, we in the United States can pump until we are blue in the face and it will not change the fact that we need more diverse and more secure sources of energy.","I used to be in the real estate business, and I have three areas of interest: Chickamauga Lock, Chickamauga Lock, and Chickamauga Lock.","In this post 9-11 world we live in, it is critical we take steps to improve the safety and security of the Trucking Industry which has proven to be our most mobile and flexible mode of transporting goods.","There is no accountability in soft money. None.","We must pass a national energy policy to continue our successes in the War on Terrorism.","We were all hit with sticker shock: $87 billion is a huge number.","With freedom comes responsibility, and I can think of no responsibility greater than putting on a U.S military uniform and standing in the gap between an enemy threat and civilian life.","You can't legislate or litigate good, healthy behavior but we must be willing to educate people at an early age about the affects of unhealthy living."],"Zack Wheat":["I am an arm hitter. When you snap the bat with your wrists just as you meet the ball, you give the bat tremendous speed for a few inches of its course. The speed with which the bat meets the ball is the thing that counts.","The fellows that I played with encouraged me to bunt and beat the ball out. I was anxious to make good and did as I was told. When I came to Brooklyn, I adopted an altogether different style of hitting. I stood flat-footed at the plate and slugged. That was my natural style.","I am a ball player in the summer and a farmer in the winter time, and I aim to be a success at both professions.","I smoke as much as I want and chew tobacco a good deal of the time. I don't pay any attention to the rules for keeping in physical condition. I think they are a lot of bunk. The less you worry about the effect of tea and coffee on the lining of your stomach, the longer you will live, and the happier you will be."],"Zack de la Rocha":["I think every revolutionary act is an act of love. Every song that I've written, it is because of my desire to use music as a way to empower and re-humanize people who are living in a dehumanizing setting. The song is in order to better the human condition.","I'm in this band to give volume to various struggles throughout the world. To me, the tension in this band is a minimal sacrifice.","Your anger is a gift.","One of the great things about young people is that they do question, that they do care deeply about justice, and they they have open minds.","Governor Jan Brewer and the Arizona legislature have created an environment in Arizona where performing is no longer a neutral act. They have created an environment where they can convert the normal commercial interaction between artists and their fans into the means to apply this racist law.","There are many Sheriff Arpaios. People who have taken to local city, county, and state governments across the county the idea that immigrants are the problem. That immigrants are to blame."],"Zacky Vengeance":["We're always talking and plotting and discussing what we can do to give our fans the best possible experience and leave everyone going home with having an amazing time and a memory that will last a lifetime.","There's always going to be haters, but those people are few. We're not too worried about it.","Not everyone is going to love you. Not everyone is going to like what you do, and you see a lot of people don't want to let go of the bands that they love. They don't want to move forward. They don't want to let new things come in; they're scared of change. They're scared of new bands taking over their genre. They're just scared of change.","Just by nature, we're always filled with so many ideas and want to cram as many ideas into a song as we can, and I think that gave us a lot of our signature sound.","I think everyone's trying to come up together and bring up other bands along the way, and we've always been really blessed to have bands like Metallica and Iron Maiden take us under their wing and say nice things about us.","One of our biggest pet peeves is listening to bands that use harmony guitars for the sake of it. If you can't figure out how do something different than Maiden, UFO, or even Boston, then what's the point?","Only a world spinning out of control could inspire the music and vision we have now.","In terms of content and instrumentation, I feel we have been extremely ambitious on every one of our albums going back to high school. We were the first screaming hardcore band to put a big ballad on our record.","That's what bands like Pink Floyd and bands like Rush and even the Metallica of this world have, which is long, ambitious songs that pull in all different directions.","I love listening to Led Zeppelin and classic rock albums from the Seventies. They're just so brilliant because they breathe.","We've shown everyone we are musicians first and foremost: we'll produce our own albums and play The 100 Club. We earned people's respect. We're not the band on MTV, wearing a bunch of makeup. We've proved we're the real deal.","Everything an artist does is scary, but we do it anyway. If someone tries to steer you off-course, push them outta the way and get back on course. Never giving up - that's what I truly believe all the greatest bands have done.","There are so many people involved in making an album, and naturally, all you want to do is show it to your friends and family. You just can't do any of that because all it takes is one morsel of information on the Internet. Within seconds, it's around the whole world.","Our first radio single, 'The Stage,' was eight-and-a-half minutes long. Unabashedly, we wanted to push the limits musically, lyrically, and instrumentation-wise.","When you start running out of things to do on a guitar, you have to find other ways of making music with your instrument.","I absolutely remember when I decided upon playing Ernie Ball strings, and it was right then and there at the guitar store up in Seattle when I picked up my first guitar ever. They said, 'What kind of strings should we put on it?' And I just looked at the brightest color package and said, 'That one!'","It was a big deal for us to be on Ozzfest, especially as one of the main headliners and being the band that wasn't announced: the mystery band. We'd never played the second stage at Ozzfest, and all of a sudden we're on the main stage.","That is one thing about playing with Guns N' Roses and Metallica: everyone wants to interview you.","What makes Avenged so exciting to me musically is that people either love us or hate us, but nobody sounds like us.","My dad played some guitar, and both my parents are fans of music and have huge record collections.","I remember when I was a kid, every time the Beatles were on the radio, my dad would say he'd give me a dollar if I could tell him what band it was. So by the time I was about nine, I knew to just say 'The Beatles,' and I'd get a dollar out of it.","Basically, everything I've learned on guitar, I've learned from listening to my favorite albums. I never had any formal training. My teachers were Dimebag Darrell and Slash and the guys in Rancid and Slayer.","On our first album, 'Sounding the Seventh Trumpet,' we were listening to more obscure heavy metal bands and hardcore bands.","I've had the chance to watch Metallica's James Hetfield from the side of the stage night after night, listening to his monitors, and his playing is so perfect. Slash is an amazing lead guitarist, but when you listen to his rhythm playing, you can hear how he pulls everything together with such a great feel, which is the most important thing.","A great way to get your rhythm playing together is to work with a drummer, preferably someone that has a good groove and plays solidly in time.","'Waking the Fallen' truly encompasses everything that Avenged Sevenfold was at that time. It was us being fearless, us showing our roots in heavy metal, punk, rock n' roll, and not being afraid to try everything under the sun when it comes to writing music.","Even when we were at that point when we had very few fans, we never felt like a small band. We always felt like we had a big purpose.","I've always loved big riffs and chunky guitars.","I like being able to do dueling leads, and it's fun to be able to shred.","After 'City of Evil,' the world was still kind of apprehensive about Avenged Sevenfold. They didn't know if we were a serious band or just some kids trying to play really ambitious music with crazy guitar parts that would be here one minute and gone the next.","Mike Elizondo had an incredible array of guitars in the studio, but they were all right-handed.","If we were to find a drummer that we were comfortable with and who we felt could really become a part of what we're about, it'd be great. But would we ever rush to find a guy just get back on the road? No. I think we'd rather go down with the ship.","We wanna go back to Southeast Asia and just do it right for them.","We like to be in touch with our fans, but we're also very private. 'Cause, to us, it's not about Zacky or M. Shadows or Synyster Gates. It's about Avenged Sevenfold; it's more important than any one of us.","We really wanted to create an album that had no boundary or limit to it. There's nothing to say that we couldn't release a song that belongs on 'The Stage' 20 years into our career. We want it to be an album that constantly grows with what we want to do, and that's what we did.","We're very historically tried and true when it comes to our albums. We pick the best songs; we get rid of the songs we feel don't fit on the album, and we don't work on remixing or remastering albums.","All the song choices that we've picked are unique in their own right. They're fun, and it's really just to engage our fans.","It's just so obscure to take a folk song in a different language and be a pretty well-respected English-speaking rock band and totally take a song and twist it around and have fun with it.","I can honestly tell you, if it wasn't for our fans, there would not be Avenged Sevenfold right now.","When we called each other and got the call that Jimmy had died, literally, it all ended right there. Everything we've ever known as human beings, everything we've ever known as a band, changes at that moment, and you can't think clearly.","With any success, a lot of voices come out, and you start hearing a lot more opinions on the matter. We've provoked very strong reactions in both directions since day one.","I can't honestly say with a straight face that every Avenged Sevenfold album is my favorite.","You always have to try new things, and that's the one thing that we've learned from all the greats - every album isn't gonna be every fan's favorite, but as long as you keep switching it up and making new fans, it's really about being persistent.","From day one, we've always gotten backlash for certain outlandish ideas that we've had and presented. That's also kind of been the driving force that's pushed us forward.","A lot of people have ideas and opinions on what Avenged Sevenfold should be or what we should do, and I think our No. 1 rule is to always make sure we never listen to any of that and to always do what we believe.","We're in the business of making fans that will last with us a lifetime. In order to do that, you've gotta give them something special.","It's always been a conscious thing for us to do whatever will separate us from the pack and make us happy musically.","Once you can get a fan to listen to an album a handful of times and really have a lot of substance for them to grasp, then you're looking at having a fan that really appreciates what you do for life and can appreciate coming to see it live.","With 'Hail To The King' - our last album - we obviously wore our influences on our sleeve, and it was a blatant attempt to turn on our younger generation of fans to more classic-sounding metal.","The first review our band ever got - when I was 17 years old and we had just released our first EP, and this tiny little magazine wrote a review on it, and for that month, we were the best album of the month, and we were also the worst album of the month. We won best and worst album of the month in the same magazine.","I think, as long as people have a strong opinion, whether they love or hate us, I think we're doing something right.","Iron Maiden and Metallica are bigger now than they ever were. They're playing stadiums across the entire planet. Even though it seems like their heyday was back when MTV and the radio played their songs all the time, the truth is that they've gotten bigger now because they play all the time, and people know they're going to get a great show.","You carry on knowing that there's something so much more important than yourself to deliver to millions of fans across the world, to all your friends, and to yourself.","I think we are really in touch with what's going on around us in the world of music, trying to push the bar forward and try new and exciting things that our fans can react to.","We wanna be on the frontlines of everything new and exciting. The old world order of putting out four singles before you release an album is so boring to us.","I wanna keep people on their toes, and that's just kind of how we've always operated.","To be honest, we never, ever let business weigh down the creativity of this band.","When we were trying to come up with a concept for our music video for 'The Stage' we basically run through a lot of different ideas, and ultimately, I sat and studied the lyrics that Matt had written - and they really resonated with me.","We're not the kind of people to just take a break and say everything's going good, you know, let's rest on our laurels, act like rock stars - we take it very seriously, and we certainly aren't just celebrating and doing a victory lap.","We're focused on making our fans happy, keeping each other happy, so we can do this forever.","I think the most important thing to putting on a good show is to always mix things up. Sometimes we wear makeup; other times we don't. The point is, you'll never get the same Avenged show twice. I think it's really important to be theatrical. I mean, look at Iron Maiden!","With every album, I write above my ability, and my job as a guitarist is to catch up and be able to play it live. The thing about practicing is that once you master something, you don't have to remaster it. You just keep moving forward.","I have no formal guitar training whatsoever, so it's been fun learning sweep-picking techniques. Working on these types of licks has thrown a whole new collection of tricks into the mix.","We had to take full advantage of the fact that we wanted to be one of the most creative bands out there that's getting backed by one of the biggest companies.","We're not a Screamo band.","Everyone likes to have fun. But when I look back on my life, I'm not going to say, 'Oh, we're the crazy party animals.' I'll look back and say, 'Wow, we did take this seriously.' We had fun while we were out doing it, but it's just the only thing you read about: 'They're a bunch of party animals.' To be honest, that's not true.","I worked a lot on our album cover, and I didn't just want to post it on our website one day and move on. We wound up breaking it into 18 pieces and hiding them on fan sites all over the Internet and then posting clues, so fans could put together the puzzle.","We've never tried to write radio hits. If I hear our song on the radio, it's cool, and I'm proud, but it's never a goal.","This country is filled with remarkable people. One of my best friend's families is from Iran, and they're the most American family of all time. Some of the best people that I've ever met are immigrants.","I think people have the right to love whoever they want, and I think that women have the right to do whatever they wish to their bodies given the circumstances.","To be honest, we spent many years at Warner, and in the very beginning, there was a very passionate team that worked alongside us on a daily basis. Every year that went by, we would lose just about every single person that worked directly with us, to the point that I honestly couldn't have picked up a phone and gotten one person who knew me.","I think there's a whole group of kids out there that don't relate to the glitz and glamour of hanging out in clubs and partying all the time. So I think some people are just more real than that, and I think our fans are those kind of kids that need something to relate to, and I think we're the band to do it.","I remember what it felt like when I was young, and I looked up to someone, and they would pay me just an ounce of attention. And some of the bands I listened to when I was young probably never even sold any albums, but it didn't matter to me. If I'd go up and say, 'Great show,' it would be amazing that they even would acknowledge me.","When you see a band, you want to see characters.","We're trying to do something nobody else is doing right now.","When we were recording, sometimes I wondered if what we were doing would even be possible to play live.","We have been harnessing every aspect of what makes Avenged truly unrelenting and building off of that.","Everyone loves to complain that there are no real bands on MTV, yet no one wants to step up to the plate and try to change that.","I'd like to think that we will have had something to do with a shift back to heavy rock. That's what we've wanted all along, and we knew there'd be fearless steps to take to achieve that.","We didn't say, 'Hey, we're gonna pick a bunch of cover songs,' or, 'We're gonna write an original song that has to sound like this, because we're a metal band, so we're gonna cover some metal songs.' We did the opposite. We just said, 'We're gonna have fun with these songs, and we're gonna try different things.'","Basically, we're just a bunch of kids who got together and try to use what we have and try to learn from each other.","We wanted to write songs that we really like that incorporate everything. It seems a lot of bands want to stick with one thing. We didn't want to be scared to do anything that we wanted to do. We didn't want anything to hold us back. We wanted no boundaries.","We wanted to incorporate lights and the like to really accentuate the music. We play mostly small venues, so we don't use it overboard by any means. The most important thing is the music. I think we do a good job of letting that show.","There's people that have never heard our album. The most they've seen is either our video on 'TRL' or our picture on the cover of magazines.","We go out there every night, and we fight the battle. We don't care about people who don't think we're true metal. We hope to change their minds. I have total faith.","We wanted to write the kind of songs that can really cross any language barriers, any borders, and resonate with fans around the world.","For us to dial back a little bit and have a little more straightforward, singalong appeal was a challenge. In order to do that, we had to throw away a lot of stuff."],"Zadie Smith":["I like books that expose me to people unlike me and books that do battle against caricature or simplification. That, to me, is the heroic in fiction.","In my situation, every time I write a sentence, I'm thinking not only of the people I ended up in college with but my siblings, my family, my school friends, the people from my neighborhood. I've come to realize that this is an advantage, really: it keeps you on your toes.","Desperation, weakness, vulnerability - these things will always be exploited. You need to protect the weak, ring-fence them, with something far stronger than empathy.","Well-run libraries are filled with people because what a good library offers cannot be easily found elsewhere: an indoor public space in which you do not have to buy anything in order to stay.","You can't state difference and also state equality. We have to state sameness to understand equality.","When a human being becomes a set of data on a website like Facebook, he or she is reduced. Everything shrinks. Individual character. Friendships. Language. Sensibility.","I tap danced for ten years before I began to understand people don't make musicals anymore. All I wanted to do was be at MGM working for Arthur Freed or Gene Kelly or Vincent Minelli. Historical and geographical constraints made this impossible. Slowly but surely the pen became mightier than the double pick-up time step with shuffle.","I often worry that my idea of personhood is nostalgic, irrational, inaccurate.","I never attended a creative writing class in my life. I have a horror of them; most writers groups moonlight as support groups for the kind of people who think that writing is therapeutic. Writing is the exact opposite of therapy.","If you're going to write a good book, you have to make mistakes and you have to not be so cautious all the time.","I read Carver. Julio Cortazar. Amis's essays. Baldwin. Lorrie Moore. Capote. Saramago. Larkin. Wodehouse. Anything, anything at all, that doesn't sound like me.","Novels are not about expressing yourself, they're about something beautiful, funny, clever and organic. Self-expression? Go and ring a bell in a yard if you want to express yourself.","Don't confuse honours with achievement.","The library was the place I went to find out what there was to know. It was absolutely essential.","There is a kind of desperate need for somebody to tell everyone what to do, which I find really peculiar in America. And then when you tell them, they're not interested, because it's also a country where everybody's opinion is their opinion, and they really don't give a damn what you think. So it's a very odd experience.","I think of reading like a balanced diet; if your sentences are too baggy, too baroque, cut back on fatty Foster Wallace, say, and pick up Kafka as roughage.","My life is black and white and mixed. My mother's a Rastafarian, my dad was a short white guy - it's not an affectation. It's also the lives of millions of people throughout the world.","People with children will know this: when the childcare is over, it's over on the dot. You immediately have to go into child mode; there's no down time.","The roots of rap are originally ghetto-ised or extremely working class. So when you're an artist who's making something which isn't how its mainstream appearance should be, there's always these strange questions of authenticity and what you have to do to be 'real' as a rapper.","Nowadays, I know the true reason I read is to feel less alone, to make a connection with a consciousness other than my own.","I want to write without shame or pride or over-compensation in one direction or another. To write freely.","Some people like just sitting down and being taken for a ride. That's a beautiful thing that fiction can do. But it's not the only thing. In television and film, people are ready to accept any kind of jump cut, but the slightest disturbance on the page ruffles their feathers.","A lot of women, when they're young, feel they have very good friends, and find later on that friendship is complicated. It's easy to be friends when everyone's 18.","The idea that motherhood is inherently somehow a threat to creativity is just absurd.","My short stories have always pushed twenty pages. That's no length for a short story to be. You either do them short like Carver or you stop trying.","As far as I'm concerned, if you want to find out about the last day of WWII or the roots of the Indian Mutiny, get thee to a books catalogue.","I just can't get used to the idea of being somebody unreal in people's minds. I can't live my life like that. And it's just anathema to being a writer. It's not healthy.","Your mid-thirties is a good time because you know a fair amount, you have some self-control.","Young people understand the world. They should be listened to on matters of politics and world organization. But they know nothing of their own lives.","You know, you don't expect everyone to be as educated as everyone else or have the same achievements, but you expect at least to be offered at least some of the opportunities, and libraries are the most simple and the most open way to give people access to books.","Normally, young writers have all the time in the world and they don't always use it well.","My feeling is, having lived in different classes, that people want equality of opportunity... that's the thing that makes me despair: the idea that people aren't given equality of opportunity.","Protect the time and space in which you write. Keep everybody away from it, even the people who are most important to you.","Don't romanticise your 'vocation.' You can either write good sentences or you can't. There is no 'writer's lifestyle.' All that matters is what you leave on the page.","Tell the truth through whichever veil comes to hand - but tell it. Resign yourself to the lifelong sadness that comes from never being satisfied.","It's difficult to tell the truth about how a book begins. The truth, as far as it can be presented to other people, is either wholly banal or too intimate.","I'm most honest about writing when I'm talking to family or friends, not to newspapers.","One thing you can't intend is how you will be read. I hear it said a lot that my books are about the 'search for identity', and this is said admiringly, as if I meant to encourage such a search.","Writing is my way of expressing - and thereby eliminating - all the various ways we can be wrong-headed.","Cambridge was a joy. Tediously. People reading books in a posh place. It was my fantasy. I loved it. I miss it still.","You become a different writer when you approach a short story. When things are not always having to represent other things, you find real human beings begin to cautiously appear on your pages.","There's constantly this melancholy about British hip-hop. People are always waiting for it to explode like American hip-hop, but it might just be that British hip-hop will always be as it is: an underground thing which will stay that way.","It's a funny thing about rap, that when you say 'I' into the microphone, it's like a public confession. It's very strange.","Oh yes, my generation liked to be in some pain when they read. The harder it was, the more good we believed it was doing us.","The conflation of the simple in style with the morally prescriptive in character, and the complex in style with the amoral or anarchic in character, seems to me one of the most persistently fallacious beliefs held by English students.","There is no bigger crime, in the English comic novel, than thinking you are right.","It seems that if you put people on paper and move them through time, you cannot help but talk about ethics, because the ethical realm exists nowhere if not here: in the consequences of human actions as they unfold in time, and the multiple interpretive possibility of those actions.","The lack of alternatives to an illegal action does not legitimise that action.","The utterly fallacious idea at the heart of the pro-war argument is that it is the duty of the anti-war argument to provide an alternative to war. The onus is on them to explain just cause.","We cannot be all the writers all the time. We can only be who we are.","When I was 21, I wanted to write like Kafka. But, unfortunately for me, I wrote like a script editor for 'The Simpsons' who'd briefly joined a religious cult and then discovered Foucault. Such is life.","I'm always a bit suspicious of writers who have the gift of the gab.","I have an ambition to write a great book, but that's really a competition with myself. I've noticed that a lot of young writers, people in all media, want to be famous but they don't really want to do anything. I can't think of anything less worth striving for than fame.","If you love a young writer, maybe the best thing you can do is give them a little bit of space.","I just realized quite early on that I'm not going to be the type who can write a novel every two years. I think you need to feel an urgency about the act. Otherwise, when you read it, you feel no urgency, either. So I don't write unless I really feel I need to, and that's a luxury.","I wouldn't write about people who are living and who are close to me, because I think it's a very violent thing to do to another person. And anytime I have done it, even in the disguise of fiction, the results have been horrific.","I suppose I often think of my writing as quite impersonal. But it turned out, when my father died, writing was exactly what I wanted to do.","I lost many literary battles the day I read 'Their Eyes Were Watching God.' I had to concede that occasionally aphorisms have their power. I had to give up the idea that Keats had a monopoly on the lyrical.","Like all readers, I want my limits to be drawn by my own sensibilities, not by my melanin count.","Don't we all know why nerds do what they do? To get money, which leads to popularity, which leads to girls.","World makers, social network makers, ask one question first: 'How can I do it?'","It might be useful to distinguish between pleasure and joy. But maybe everybody does this very easily, all the time, and only I am confused.","A lot of people seem to feel that joy is only the most intense version of pleasure, arrived at by the same road - you simply have to go a little further down the track. That has not been my experience.","If you asked me if I wanted more joyful experiences in my life, I wouldn't be at all sure I did, exactly because it proves such a difficult emotion to manage.","English fiction was something I loved growing up, and it changed my life - it changed the trajectory of my life.","People profess to have certain political positions, but their conservatism or liberalism is really the least interesting thing about them.","I don't take notes. I don't have any notebooks. I keep on trying to do that because it seems like a very writerly thing to do, but my mind doesn't work that way. I tend to get the idea for a novel in a big splash.","All my books are made up of other books. They're all deeply structured on other fiction, because I was a student in fiction and I didn't have much actual living to draw on. I suspect a lot of other people's novels are like that, too, though they might be slower to talk about it.","I noticed in America that if you write a book of any kind, you're made to be the representative of all the issues that might surround it.","I wrote 'White Teeth' in the late nineties. I didn't really feel trepidatious about it. It was a different time.","Books are not brands. Some people are very willing to see themselves as a brand, but you can't be a certain type of writer to a certain type of person all the time. It will kill you.","That's the thing about fiction writers: what seems alarming or particular or perverse about them is simply the shape of their brain - they cannot be otherwise.","I'm very attracted to exile literature - particularly Nabokov - exactly because the idea of being away from home for any serious length of time is so inconceivable to me.","When I think of the books I love, there's always a little laughter in the dark.","English, as a subject, never really got over its upstart nature. It tries to bulk itself up with hopeless jargon and specious complexity, tries to imitate subjects it can never be.","Without the balancing context of everyday life, all you have is the news, and news by its nature is generally bad.","I recognize myself to be an intensely naive person. Most novelists are, despite frequent pretensions to deep socio-political insight.","It seems to me that we often commit ourselves wholly to something while knowing almost nothing concrete about it. Another word for that, I suppose, is 'faith.'","All novels attempt to cut neural routes through the brain, to convince us that down this road the true future of the novel lies.","Nabokov, who I loved more than any other writer when I was young, had such contempt for dialogue. When I was younger, I never wrote a word of dialogue because of him. I thought it was a childish part of a novel.","I love to dance, and sing - in the shower, not in public. I'm too old to go raving, but my fondest memories are of that kind of thing - dancing, with lots of people, outside if possible.","I can't add. I don't understand basic science. Or anything else. But I can read anything. I've always been able to, and I've always liked to. Even if I didn't understand it, I liked to.","Asking why rappers always talk about their stuff is like asking why Milton is forever listing the attributes of heavenly armies. Because boasting is a formal condition of the epic form. And those taught that they deserve nothing rightly enjoy it when they succeed in terms the culture understands.","Can't a rapper insist, like other artists, on a fictional reality, in which he is somehow still on the corner, despite occupying the penthouse suite?","I think I know a thing or two about the way people love, but I don't know anything about hatred, psychosis, cruelty. Or maybe I don't have the guts to admit that I do.","I'm never interested in writing a kind of neutral, universal novel that could be set anywhere. To me, the novel is a local thing.","I don't keep any copies of my books in the house - they go to my mum's flat. I don't like them around.","Women often have a great need to portray themselves as sympathetic and pleasing, but we're also dark people with dark thoughts.","Any artist who aligns themselves with a politician is making a category error because what politicians do is not on a human scale, it is on a geopolitical scale.","Unless you consider yourself some sort of human brand, which I don't, you have to deal with the fact that different people are going to like different aspects of your work. It's not consistent. I am not consistent. But I feel OK with that.","I like books that don't give you an easy ride. I like the feeling of discomfort. The sense of being implicated.","Working with great writers can be humbling and frightening, but it can also change you for good, forever.","English writing tends to fall into two categories - the big, baggy epic novel or the fairly controlled, tidy novel. For a long time, I was a fan of the big, baggy novel, but there's definitely an advantage to having a little bit more control."],"Zaha Hadid":["I don't think that architecture is only about shelter, is only about a very simple enclosure. It should be able to excite you, to calm you, to make you think.","I will never give myself the luxury of thinking, 'I've made it.'","I used to not like being called a 'woman architect': I'm an architect, not just a woman architect. Guys used to tap me on the head and say, 'You are okay for a girl.' But I see the incredible amount of need from other women for reassurance that it could be done, so I don't mind that at all.","For many years, I hated nature. As a student, I refused to put a plant anywhere - a living plant, that is. Dead plants were OK.","People don't talk to you properly. It's the way they talk to you; they dismiss you. I think it's a combination of me being a woman and a foreigner.","Architecture is how the person places herself in the space. Fashion is about how you place the object on the person.","What's nice about concrete is that it looks unfinished.","As a woman, I'm expected to want everything to be nice and to be nice myself. A very English thing. I don't design nice buildings - I don't like them. I like architecture to have some raw, vital, earthy quality.","I have always appreciated those who dare to experiment with materials and proportions.","I think about architecture all the time. That's the problem. But I've always been like that. I dream it sometimes.","Good education is so important. We do need to look at the way people are taught. It not just about qualifications to get a job. It's about being educated.","The funkiest housing in Holland is for low-income, and I think that's very nice.","Women are always told, 'You're not going to make it, its too difficult, you can't do that, don't enter this competition, you'll never win it,' - they need confidence in themselves and people around them to help them to get on.","It's very important that historic cities are allowed to reinvent their future.","I've always thought that design can have equal importance to the idea of internal architecture. Professionally, things can be very dogmatic - you do the architecture, someone else does the interiors, someone else does the furniture, the fabric, etc. But I think design is all-encompassing.","When you are overworked and exhausted, there is a sense of kind of delirium and that's why I think architects do all-nighters and they kind of do those deadlines. For four days I remember doing four nights in one row with no sleep. I mean nobody, unless you are crazy, would do that, but you are totally focused on the project.","I really believe in the idea of the future.","People say I design architectural icons. If I design a building and it becomes an icon, that's ok.","I am sure that as a woman I can do a very good skyscraper.","I miss aspects of being in the Arab world - the language - and there is a tranquility in these cities with great rivers. Whether it's Cairo or Baghdad, you sit there and you think, 'This river has flown here for thousands of years.' There are magical moments in these places.","Architecture is unnecessarily difficult. It's very tough.","Of course I believe imaginative architecture can make a difference to people's lives, but I wish it was possible to divert some of the effort we put into ambitious museums and galleries into the basic architectural building blocks of society.","Education, housing and hospitals are the most important things for society.","Obviously for some people there is a big connection between music and the way you can create a space.","I was always unusual-looking; I wouldn't say beautiful.","Architecture is particularly difficult for women; there's no reason for it to be. I don't want to blame men or society, but I think it was for a long time, the clients were men, the building industry is all male.","If I wanted to do clothes or if I wanted to make a building or design a choreography, you are able to do that - they are all under a similar kind of design umbrella.","I think that the training of architects allows you to see what will happen ten years ahead of time, or twenty. It's not guessing, it's not intuitive, it's based on research - and we may be wrong.","I'm a pushover. I make allowances for people if I like them.","Would they call me a diva if I were a guy?","When I first came to Guangzhou in 1981, it seemed such a hard and dour place with everyone in Chairman Mao uniforms.","Contrary to popular view, I've never been patronized in the Middle East. Men maybe treat women differently, but they do not treat them with disrespect. They don't hate women. It's a very different kind of mentality.","Like men, women have to be diligent and work hard.","You don't always have to show art in what's called a white box; you can have a kind of complexity within an exhibit which actually respects the art as well.","Being Iraqi taught me to be very cautious.","There are so many great galleries and museums in London, but they can be very crowded during the day.","Society has not been set up in a way that allows women to go back to work after taking time off. Many women now have to work as well as do everything at home and no one can do everything. Society needs to find a way of relieving women.","My friendships are very important to me.","I have always appreciated designers who dare to reinterpret fabrics and proportions, so I follow the Japanese and Belgian designers. The pieces are so animated. When they lie still, they are one thing, but once you stand them up or wear them, they become something else.","The spirit of adventure to embrace the new and the incredible belief in the power of invention attracted me to the Russian avant-garde.","I find industrial cities exciting. I like their toughness.","Of course, my family helped me, my brothers helped me, but after I set up my own office I had to really help myself. Some people seem to think I had an oil well in my garden! It's a nice idea but not true.","When I taught, all my best students were women.","In hospital, people should be able to have time to themselves.","I am equally proud of all of my architectural projects. It's always rewarding to see an ambitious design become reality.","My generation were all careerists.","I don't particularly like showing furniture on pedestals, but for whatever reasons you always have to in museums.","I really love Miami, but I don't think the architecture matches the city. It's a bit too commercial.","My father was a politician, and a very important politician, and one of the leaders of the Iraqi Democratic Party, who believed in progress.","If you think about making a city that is much more porous, many accessible spaces, that is a political position, because you don't fortify, you open it up so that many people can use it.","Wherever I am in the world, my perfect day begins with waking up and heading to the beach or the pool or somewhere I can be semi-comatose. I just wake up and go to the sun.","I love driving around east London - it's always full of surprises. Actually, I don't drive myself - I like to be driven.","I will always have two regrets. I don't have a presence in London, and I would have liked to have done more work in the Middle East.","I don't think people should do things because you know, 'I am turning this age, I must go have a husband.' If you find somebody and it works out then have kids, it's very nice. But if you don't, you don't.","I don't think I am that tough, actually. Well, tough in the sense that I don't take any rubbish, and that doesn't make me very popular, frankly. I mean, because some people say something to me, and I just tell them off. I mean, why should I put up with it?","I like music. Country, hip-hop, R&B, sometimes classical.","All the privileged can travel, see different worlds; not everyone can. I think it is important for people to have an interesting locale nearby.","My buildings are not particularly expensive. It is not a tin shed. If you want a tinny car, you pay for that.","I think it's good if areas get upgraded and gentrified, as long as the people who always lived there can stay. But they get pushed out to some place.","What's similar between Britain and America is the lack of good-quality civic buildings.","I loved London. In the 1970s... it was very exciting, really wild.","I have been interested in fashion since I was a kid. Then I lived in London, where it was more about costume and a personal statement of who you are than about fashion.","I'm into fashion because it contains the mood of the day, of the moment - like music, literature, and art.","In Iraq, many of my female friends were architects and professionals with a lot of power during the 1980s while all the men were at war in Iran.","Life in the Middle East is quite different from other places.","Men think a woman should not have an opinion.","I made a decision when I was in school that I'd have a lot of male friends.","As a woman, you're not accessible to every world.","I am quite sensitive to politics, because you know, as an Arab, an Iraqi, all your life, you are very conscious of it.","People in power, they're so used to people kind of playing up to them.","I don't think that everybody in the planet should have a child. I've never had the desire I should have a kid.","I can't focus when there's too many things around. Whenever I used to go to the office, I used to always say, 'Tidy up.'","Half of architecture students are women, and you see respected, established female architects all the time.","When I was growing up in Iraq, there was an unbroken belief in progress and a great sense of optimism. It was a moment of nation building.","My father was a socialist, so he would have thought that I shouldn't be a dame.","I always thought I was powerful, since I was a kid.","The commission process in America and England is different. In America, they do it through an interview process, and it's really based on whether they like you or not. I mean, it's nothing to do with whether you do the best scheme or the worst scheme.","It's very important for cities all around the world to reinvent themselves, and Glasgow is a good example of that. The Scots are very nice. I don't think they are burdened by their history."],"Zahi Hawass":["It's very important to reveal the mystery of the pyramid. Science in archaeology is very important. People all over the world are waiting to solve this mystery.","The sphinx will always have to be looked after.","When we find something new at Giza, we announce it to the world. The Sphinx and the Pyramids are world treasures. We are the guardian's of these treasures, but they belong to the world.","Two hundred and fifty mummies covered in gold. Something like this cannot be explained - mummy after mummy covered in shining gold.","I found in one of the tombs an inscription saying, 'If you touch my tomb, you will be eaten by a crocodile and hippopotamus.' It doesn't mean the hippo will eat you, it means the person really wanted his tomb to be protected.","As scientists, we keep an open mind, but we have to base our ideas about the past on archaeological evidence.","Not a single piece of material culture - not a single object - has been found at Giza that can be interpreted to come from a lost civilization.","We are the only ones who really can care about the preservation Foreigners who come to excavate, maybe some of them care about preservation, but the majority care about discoveries.","Anyone can like their job... To love your job is not enough, you must give your passion to your job.","I am damn good. I am doing all this for Egypt and nothing else. I reject 70 per cent of media interviews while these people who accuse me are running after them.","I will announce some of the tombs I found next to the great pyramid of Khufu. One is an intact tomb that I have not opened yet.","I will reveal the secrets behind these doors.","It makes the heart to tremble when you open an undiscovered tomb.","Many parts of the granite statues were found, the most important of which had features close to Ramses II. The statue needs some restoration and weighs between four and five tons."],"Zainab Salbi":["Sometimes you just have to jump off the cliff without knowing where you will land.","No change can come if those who are impacted the most by discrimination are not willing to stand up for themselves.","Being a leader for me is about having the courage to speak the truth, and live the truth, despite attempts to silence our thoughts, feelings, and past experiences.","I don't want to be someone in my sixties holding on to a group that I created when I was in my twenties.","The single thing all women need in the world is inspiration, and inspiration comes from storytelling.","I by no means intend to simplify the challenges women face in any culture. Women are marginalized in all cultures in my opinion, some in more extreme ways than others.","Every woman must own her story; otherwise we are all part of the silence.","I don't have a child, so Women for Women is like my child. But I always said I would step down after 20 years. I didn't want to be a 60-year-old woman holding on to something I created when I was 23.","Like life, peace begins with women. We are the first to forge lines of alliance and collaboration across conflict divides.","I grew up with injustice and could do nothing about it. But once in America, I had freedom of choice.","There is never a typical week. I don't think I can live with a typical week.","Since I was 15 years old I have dedicated my life to serving women.","There's a lot of projection that if you're in service then you shouldn't look good. I'm no different from anybody else. I like clothes, I like shoes, I like to go have nice dinners, I like to dance. Just because I've dedicated myself to serving women, why do you think I need to sacrifice myself?","In every single culture I encountered, there were always women who defied cultural norms to do what they believed was right for them. This phenomenon has never been related to how rich, poor, successful or not successful the woman may be.","By accepting what the external structures have told us we need to do, we have given the power of our realities and ourselves to others. It is time to tell a new story for women, and that can only start with women.","As women, we must speak out, speak up, say no to our inheritance of loss and yes to a future of women-led dialogue about women's rights and value.","I have come to understand that in order to effectively advance women's rights, we need to galvanize a global women's movement.","While women may look different, as some wear suits and others wear saris, or some cover their hair while others wear their hair loose, women need to stand together because they all face the central point of discrimination, although the extremity of which may be different from Kigali to Kabul.","Leadership is about encouraging women to break their silence and tell their stories to the world.","Do you know that people fall in love in war and go to school and go to factories and hospitals and get divorced and go dancing and go playing and live life?","In my 20s I was such a serious, boring-looking person. I would never do my nails. I never even danced. But I was taught by the women. They had gone through hell, but they would dance and sing. I came to realise I can't argue for a happy world if I am not happy myself.","I couldn't find anyone doing something about the astounding injustices women were experiencing, so I decided to do something myself. I cannot tell you how many people ridiculed my efforts."],"Zak Orth":["Homophobia is manufactured in high schools, so it's probably useful to keep in mind that it really does bother people.","Actually, I was born Adam Zachary Orth. Zak is short for my middle name. I was never called Adam.","I grew up around backstage, and that clinched it for me.","I think there is some credibility to the notion that marriage is an institution. It meant something very different hundreds of years ago when it became the norm for people to go off and pair.","I worked with Michael Black and Michael Showalter on their show 'Michael and Michael Have Issues.' We did some stuff on that, but it ended up not getting picked up for a second season. There will be more stuff, but not right now. Michael Showalter and I are literally next-door neighbors. We see quite a lot of each other.","As far as writing or directing a film, I've worked with enough people who have done that that I know it's just a whole other level of responsibility and chaos and murder that I could not see happening. For now, I'm just going to see what comes. I know what I like and what direction I have."],"Zakk Wylde":["You've got certain guys that just want to be famous and then you've got the real musicians that just love playing music.","We were sitting on the bus one day and there were 5 of us hanging out. There was only one beer left in the cooler and we actually all took a little cup and split it. It was a pathetic day in a rock and roll when five grown men have to be sitting there sharing a beer.","You never toot your own horn.","One day my wife went and saw the accountant and said she's pulling the plug. She said you guys are done. I said, how bad can it be? 10 grand? She said you're not even close. It came out to almost $50,000 in alcohol for two months.","If you bleed Black Label and you're going to be a man, you gotta get up there and do what you gotta do every day, relentless and as tired as you can be.","I'm just worried that there's enough beer on the bus. That's the top priority at all times.","Around my house, I won't even speak to my family unless they first address me by my official Berzerker name, Godred Crovan, Victor of Sky-Hill and Ruler of Man and the Isles. And now that I think of it, that's probably why nobody speaks to me unless it's time to feed the dogs or take out the garbage.","The way I look at it you can always get better.","Another Black Label motto. That's what I think life is. It's just another bridge to cross. You ask no questions. Whatever work it is you gotta do, you gotta go over it, under it, through it, around it, to do it.","You had better love the music... because sometimes the music doesn't love you.","I had throat surgery. We had to check that out and make sure it wasn't cancerous. I had a polyp on my vocal cord, so I had that taken out.","Great musicians, you don't just hear them, you feel them. When I listen to Randy Rhoads, I feel every note. I learned a lot from him.","I'm excited to join my brother-in-law Ken Thomson every Tuesday night on SiriusXM to recap all of the awesome NFL action, and to find out what in the Wylde world of sports is going on.","You're never going to learn everything.","We just done doing The Blessed Hellride tour and Ozzfest.","There's only one Sabbath guitarist and he is the architect for everything, Tony Iommi.","The tours are campaigns.","That's why for Zakk Wylde's Black Label Society the colors are black and white. There are no gray issues. Life is black and it's white. There's no in-between.","Since day one my thing has always been to play the music.","Ozzy has dyslexia.","On the tour we get a case of beer on the bus every day from Ozzfest.","It's pure Black Label. It's about violence and booze. That's all it is. There is no plan.","It isn't a band. It's bigger than a band. It's a lifestyle.","If somebody says they really like my playing I say thanks a lot.","If I'm playing with Ozzy it's just a guitar thing. But with the vocals I feel like I'm studying for the SATs.","I've messed myself up more playing music than when I played football.","I screwed my knee up once because I fell off the stage.","I feel sorry for these kids in bands. Everything is so disposable nowadays. These kids don't even get 15 minutes of fame, it's like a minute and a half.","Had an awesome time. You tell me to show up and all I have to do is drink beer, play guitar all day and I can lift weights and you're going to pay me for this!","Chris Jericho is a great guy. He's beyond hysterical. He's good people. They're really good. Chris wanted me to throw down a solo. He sent it to me and I knocked it out.","Because with Black Label and all the fans it's just one big family.","Back when I was jamming with Axl and the guys they had boxes of cassettes with song ideas. How do you know which ones you like now when you have that many ideas.","Any guy that's not working with the same amount of intensity and passion that I do, I don't want to know.","Another time I cracked two of the vertebrae in my back and broke a rib.","As much as I love heavy riffs, I like The Eagles, Neil Young, Elton John, Crowded House.","I'm a good Catholic boy.","If I sit down with an electric guitar, what's going to come out are Sabbath/Zeppelin type riffs, but if I'm sitting behind a piano late at night, I might write something like 'Desperado.' You're not going to write 'Desperado' between a wall of Marshalls and thumping, crushing volume.","Without a doubt, even when I play with Black Label, when we have different guys I play with, everyone always brings their own magic, their own flavor to the soup, hands down.","You listen to Black Sabbath with Ronnie James Dio in it, and it's not Black Sabbath. They should have just called it 'Heaven and Hell' right from the beginning. Because you listen to that 'Heaven and Hell' album, that doesn't sound anything close to Black Sabbath.","With Nine Inch Nails, it's all Trent Reznor. So when we get a new record from Nine Inch Nails, it depends on what side of the bed Trent's waking up on and what he's been eating lately and what he's been into. Because he's preparing the whole meal.","I love the whole process for each new album. The writing, the touring, everything. For me, it never gets old.","All my writing, I always do it in the studio, 'cause everything sounds good. The piano's there, the keyboards; if you want to put strings on something... And everything sounds good when it's in the cans; it sounds killer.","For me, the music dictates the melody. Give me a riff to sing over, you know?","I don't think it's ever changed, whether its Frank Sinatra, Glenn Miller, Zeppelin, Guns n' Roses or anyone today, the reason why you get into music is because you love it, and if you're good at it, that's a plus.","You have to pay attention, like with tours and expenses; you have to factor that all in. You want to play music for the rest of your life, you have to pay attention to all the things. You want to know what's always going on.","For Black Label Special Opps, adversity is what you thrive on. General Patton is a huge fan favorite in Black Label."],"Zalmay Khalilzad":["We are not going to abandon Iraq.","It is important that the Iraqi people have confidence in the election results and that the voting process, including the process for vote counting, is free and fair.","Success in Iraq will be a major setback for terrorists and a major asset for the security of this region. The struggle for Iraq is the struggle for the future of the world.","The national unity government will need to implement a program that brings all Iraqis together, builds a happy future for the people of Iraq, and gets Iraq to stand on its own feet.","The U.S. and Iraq will work together next year to shift Iraqi resources from unproductive subsidies to productive uses that enable Iraqis to earn livelihoods."],"Zana Marjanovic":["I was eight when I left Sarajevo, so I didn't really know very much about my culture and it was so important for me to go back to my roots and meet the people.","I'm a rational person, and I'm not a method actor. You don't need to call me by my character's name while I'm not shooting.","The whole borrowing clothes thing is very unnatural for me. I don't feel comfortable with that. If you like something, I'd just give it to you rather than sharing it."],"Zane Grey":["Love grows more tremendously full, swift, poignant, as the years multiply.","I need this wild life, this freedom.","I arise full of eagerness and energy, knowing well what achievement lies ahead of me.","Love of man for woman - love of woman for man. That's the nature, the meaning, the best of life itself.","I am tired. My arm aches. My head boils. My feet are cold. But I am not aware of any weakness.","I see so much more than I used to see. The effect has been to depress and sadden and hurt me terribly.","What makes life worth living? Better surely, to yield to the stain of suicide blood in me and seek forgetfulness in the embrace of cold dark death.","I will see this game of life out to its bitter end.","I am full of fire and passion. I am not ready yet for great concentration and passion.","Men may rise on stepping stones of their dead selves to higher things.","The difficulty, the ordeal, is to start.","Today I began the novel that I determined to be great.","I confess that reading proofs is a pleasure. It stimulates and inspires me.","This motion-picture muddle had distracted me from my writing.","Every once in a while I feel the tremendous force of the novel. But it does not stay with me.","What is writing but an expression of my own life?","These critics who crucify me do not guess the littlest part of my sincerity. They must be burned in a blaze. I cannot learn from them.","The Indian story has never been written. Maybe I am the man to do it.","I must go deeper and even stronger into my treasure mine and stint nothing of time, toil, or torture.","I did not have one bad spell during writing - an unprecedented record.","It was a decent New Year's, but it took a million officers to make it so.","There are hours when I must force the novel out of my mind and be interested in the children.","No one connected intimately with a writer has any appreciation of his temperament, except to think him overdoing everything.","I hate birthdays.","I wrote for nearly six hours. When I stopped, the dark mood, as if by magic, had folded its cloak and gone away.","I can write best in the silence and solitude of the night, when everyone has retired.","Work is my salvation. It changes my moods.","I love my work but do not know how I write it.","Writing was like digging coal. I sweat blood. The spell is on me."],"Zara Cox":["I'm a voracious reader. I also have a ton of favorite TV shows I'm addicted to.","Ninety percent of my ideas come to me either when I'm reading or watching a show.","I loved Alessandra Torre's 'Black Lies.'","I'm quite adept at writing two or sometimes even three stories at once. So if I get stuck on one story, I switch the next and let my subconscious work on unraveling any plot problems from another story."],"Zara Larsson":["I wear jewellery that I never take off. I have a ring and two necklaces. I always have them on and get scared when I have to take them off for photo shoots. The ring is my mum's mum's mum's, and she gave it to me for my 18th birthday. The necklace is the same one that my sister has. She's called Hannah, and the name is the chain.","In the car on my way to the studio, I was listening to 'Where Are U Now' with Justin Bieber and Jack U, so I was like, 'Wow, this is such a banger.' I loved the thought of having a ballad at the beginning and then just a massive drop.","I love to go all out - once I start doing my makeup, I kind of tend to do a lot of it. So like foundation, contour, highlight, eyeliner, shadow, lashes, lipstick - everything! But I really, really love my contours.","I like to spend as much time with my friends and family as possible.","I'm not even close to where I want to be; it's just a little mini step on the way. This is only the beginning.","In my personal life, I would just feel like, I will always be cool with everyone.","If I have a day off, I'll get up at three in the afternoon and make some noodles. I fix my makeup and then party until 5 A.M.","History is important but... I just wanna sing Beyonce songs all day long in front of a mirror.","Everybody wants attention, more or less. I just want a lot.","I've always loved to perform in front of people, but it became pretty serious when I participated in 'Sweden's Got Talent.' I thought it would be a fun thing to do, and I was just like, 'OK, why not?' And Mom was like, 'OK, sure, sure, do this!' So I did, and I won it!","I've always wanted to be a singer.","When I was little, I had concerts on the subway, and old ladies came up to me like, 'You are so good!'","The only person I'd cry if I met would be Beyonce.","We're here for a little, little bit of time, and I just wanna make the most out of it.","I've always just wanted people to look at me.","I think my thing is that... I don't know. And that's why I don't wanna sing about 'This is me, this is who I am' because, like, even the question, 'Tell me about yourself' - what are you supposed to say? 'Ooh, I'm a happy girl, but I'm sad, too'? People are so complex.","I have some friends, and they're super-hipster. And they're like, 'All I wanna do is sing in a jazz bar and to just make it to pay for the rent.' And I'm like, 'Cool... That's not what I wanna do. I want as many people as possible to go to my concert.'","A lot of my friends send me Snapchats of when they're in the club, and they're like, 'It's your song!'","Literally, when I go to the vocal coach, I'm like, 'You are teaching me nothing.' You know?","People say, 'Oh you're so good, and you're so young!' It's like, 'No. I'm good. Period!'","I would say that the majority of the people I work with are Swedish, very unknown producers and writers but so talented.","I'm still so young, so I feel like people have wanted to keep me in a 'no-makeup' fresh type of look - sometimes artists are a little afraid of really putting the makeup on me.","I'd like to sell out worldwide stadium tours. That'd be something. Or to have sixty number ones on Billboard.","It really is a dream coming true, being on Billboard.","That's absolutely one of my main goals, to have a number one on Billboard. That's a big thing for me. That means people are buying and listening to your music.","The Monsters & Strangerz, I love them so much.","Some people can't sing - like honestly - but they're famous anyway, and they might be famous for being an artist, which is completely different from being a singer.","It could be interesting doing something with Kanye.","Mostly, I just write about feelings that people can relate to. Because, yeah, I don't know who I am, and this is not my sound forever... I'm a human, so hopefully, I will always develop.","I'm just waiting for the day when my songs aren't flying. Because I kind of believe in Murphy's law - if something can go wrong, it eventually will.","I work so hard, but... everything just goes my way! It's insane!","In America, you can't say to your family, 'Hey, I'm off to L.A. to make it as a songwriter; sorry I can't pay for the dentist.'","I think life is a chain of events.","I do pop, so pop is very broad. It could be anything from the Weeknd to Taylor Swift to Beyonce to whatever is on the radio, basically.","When I was about nine or 10, I was on a few random talent shows in shopping malls.","It's very, very important to wash off makeup. Like, really wash it off - I used to be really bad and leave some on when I would go to bed, but it's so important to get it all off.","I love eyebrows, so brow pencils and brow shadow are really important to me.","I think whatever you love the most is where you should spend your money.","If you love attention and have a pretty decent voice, that's a pretty good combination.","When I look at my streams on Spotify, and I just see it's hundreds of millions of streams, I think, 'Wow, that's amazing.' But you don't really get it. Once you see people in front of you singing along to your songs, it's real.","I don't really have a type. I don't want to be a cliche. But personality is a big thing for me. You can find cute guys all over. But he's got to have some sort of sense of humor, which is so hard to find in a guy. He's got to be a bit smart.","My dream is to stand in front of 60,000 people in an arena and know that everyone came because they wanted to make memories with me.","That's a beautiful thing. The more successful you are, the more people are going to come and be a part of music.","I, personally, do not consider myself to be some kind of Holy Mary of feminism.","I'm just being me on Instagram, and that's what I love about it. It's definitely personal, and it's, like, no one in my team would ever get my password for my Instagram. Like, that's a no-no.","I always sang after every dinner or when we had people over or when we had a show in school. I just loved to be on stage and sing in front of people.","For me, it's actually really hard to write about my real experience. Like to do a Taylor Swift. You know what I mean? It's so brave to actually write about things that happened and things you wanna get off your chest, but I'm not really there yet.","Of course, I consider myself a feminist, but I wouldn't say I'm a feminist genius or anything.","I think she's so cool, but I personally don't think I sound like Rihanna! But when I first released my music, I did get that comparison a lot. I never really thought about that, but it's a good thing. She's awesome.","Beyonce's the only contemporary artist that I really, really idolize.","I love to have a band, but dancers are my priority because I really want a show, you know?","My dream is to have a bed of my own in Los Angeles and one in Sweden.","Sweden will always be my home, since my childhood there was like a fairytale, so I'll always go back to it.","I've always known that singing was some sort of calling for me. It comes naturally.","If it weren't for singing, I don't know what else I would do with myself.","'Never Forget You' was the first song I co-wrote.","Could you imagine being from Siberia? Like, a small part of Russia, where it's like, 'When was the last time Russia was having a super big international pop star in the U.S.?' I don't know, but I can name a few from Sweden. I think that gives us a lot of confidence in being pop stars because we're like, 'Oh, we actually can. We know we can.'","We have a history of great producers - ABBA and Max Martin - we have proof of people being successful from Sweden.","If it's a good song, it's a good song. I'll take it."],"Zara Phillips":["I love hats; I love putting hats on. They are artwork. You can always go out and find a dress to wear for some occasion, but there are not that many occasions you can wear a hat.","I don't think I'll still be riding at 40. There are a couple of people who are still riding after having kids, like Mary King, but people say that you lose your nerve after you have kids. It's the risk.","Unfortunately in sport it's either good or bad. You've got to take the highs and the lows.","I'm not a princess anyway so I find that quite weird to be labelled as one.","In our sport you're very lucky to find a horse of a lifetime and I found mine relatively early. He's done everything for me and I owe him the world.","I hate having my picture taken.","People still text me to say that there is something about me in the paper, and what really annoys me is that if it's nasty, I then have to go and have a look, even though actually I don't want to know.","The senior members of the royal family work very hard and I don't think people quite realise that.","I'm an affectionate person.","It's stupid to say that I don't like being in the public eye, but I don't like doing stuff that's not needed.","The horses are all characters, all personalities. Some you get along with, some you don't, some might take a bit longer.","I love the sport and being competitive.","Virtually everything that gets printed about me is wrong anyway, so it doesn't really matter what you say.","I don't think about the media.","You cannot make horses 'safe.'","I think Facebook's dangerous. So many people I know get into trouble with Facebook... I'd rather just pick up the phone. Or Skype.","I'd love to have kids, but not at the moment.","My brother and I have been able to get on and have been very lucky to do things with our family that other people wouldn't have been able to do. But then again, we've also been able to live a normal life as well.","My dad can be pretty critical sometimes.","My dad's not a big talker.","My mother is massively into sailing, so we always had Musto clothes, and it went on from there, really. I wouldn't say it's a career in fashion. The range is all day-to-day stuff that I'd put on and use myself.","Taking part in an Olympics on home ground is something you dream about.","Sometimes people will come up in the street and say: 'My daughter loves you, will you sign an autograph for her?' And some people send me stuff. I don't mind it at all: as a sportswoman, you owe them because they support you.","I don't have a stylist, and I do most of my shopping online, just because it's easier. I don't have any nails to manicure, and it takes me 30 minutes to get ready for a night out, as long as I've decided what to wear first.","I was always told from the hat-makers that you should have your hair up because it shows the hat more. It feels more 'done' when your hair is up.","I don't mind a big fascinator. I think there is more scope for artwork in a fascinator rather than a hat."],"Zarin Mehta":["I grew up with music very much in my life. I achieved success by combining my training as an accountant with my family upbringing and love of music.","Accountancy prepares one to be able to run very different kinds of businesses, and my background prepared me for the music.","I think in all cultural organizations there has to be renewal. I'm also of a certain age that someone new can come in with a breath of fresh air. Things change, and I think that's important.","My paternal grandfather Rustom Mehta had a huge influence on me because of his ethics and his values.","I would still like to own and run a restaurant serving Indian food with a good dollop of Parsi cooking - which you can't seem to get anywhere.","Too many people dwell on the past: the thing is to get on with life."],"Zayn Malik":["Everything is very black and white for me. I don't really like playing mind games.","I like the term 'misunderstood.' But I am a bit of a bad boy.","Some girls like to say one thing and mean another. And me being who I am, I'm very straightforward. Everything is very black and white for me. I don't really like playing mind games.","I am a bit of a bad boy. I have tattoos and I mess around. That's part of my image, so it's cool.","When people are putting pressure on me I just completely ignore it.","I'm kind of like a bit of everything wrapped into one.","I'd call myself the mediator. I kind of just float around and do my own thing. I'm kind of chilled out, laid back.","I'm always drawing, so Draw Something is a cool game to play against your friends when you're bored and sat chilling out and relaxing.","Some girls like to say one thing and mean another. And me being who I am, I'm very straightforward.","It's nice to look out and see your family supporting you.","I just love comic books. I've always loved comic book art, and I just think it's amazing.","I'm not one to get involved with what anyone says about me.","Two years ago, if anyone had told me I'd be doing half the stuff I'm doing, I wouldn't have believed it.","Whenever anything went wrong at home, because I was the only boy, I would get blamed for it straight away. Girls stick together.","The reason I don't tweet as much as I used to, is because I'm sick of all the useless opinions and hate that I get daily. Goodbye Twitter.","It's pretty strange because you have images of people in your head when you left, then you just think they're going to be the same when you come back, like time freezes. I have sisters and from the ages of 11 to 13 - it's a big change for girls.","I believe that your religion should be between you and whoever your belief is in.","You can say whatever you want about me, I'm not really bothered. But when it starts to upset people I care about or I hear about it from my mum, then that's a problem.","If you meet a girl, you meet a girl. It's normal, so if you exchange numbers, whatevs, it's cool.","We needed to make a sound that's not gonna fit in with everything else - we wanted to make something that was completely unique and individual to us. We spent a lot of time trying to make a sound that was a One Direction sound. At first it was quite hard to do that, but I'm really happy with the sound.","I do feel like I've missed out a bit because I was really close with my sisters when I was at home. It must be weird for them but they cope really well.","We didn't really expect to achieve anything outside of the UK, and it just went crazy. It's just crazy that people know our music. We're just humbled by it.","I consider myself very lucky, essentially - I was put into a pop group even though my musical taste was very niche before.","I'm a couch potato. I love to stay in and just watch a DVD with the missus. Or we all go over to Louis's house and watch 'X Factor.'","I was a bit of a handful when I was a kid because I was quite hyperactive. Even in the house my mum used to put me in my pram because I was so full-on.","One Direction is the main thing I'm doing and I'm 100 per cent dedicated to the group.","I love samosas filled with mincemeat. My mum makes really great ones.","I'm a massive fan of Drake, and we walked right past him. He's too cool to be clapping One Direction though.","Now that we have a bit of money, it is nice to get gifts for people. Before I was getting and not really giving.","When we were on 'The X Factor,' we didn't realize how overnight the fame thing was. We didn't really understand it until we went on a shopping trip. It was like Week 7 or 8 of the show. We went with a few other contestants and there were loads of people, packed.","Our parents are obviously proud, but they're still trying to get used to the fact that we're in a band. I have a feeling my mom would actually like One Direction if I wasn't in it!","Honestly, like, American football is not that big over in the U.K., so we hadn't really heard of Drew Brees before. I did know that he was, like, a massive football player. He's a massive star, so I was still a little bit anxious and nervous to meet him.","When we were in Sweden, there was a fan that hid in a bin. I think one of the security guards saw and tried to take her out, and she went a bit crazy and started tackling them.","I've got three sisters, five aunties, and my mom. It must have had an influence on me growing up.","I think people I'm close to find it absolutely crazy that I'm famous."],"Zazie Beetz":["I'm pretty picky about my hair, so I end up always styling it myself.","I've begun feeling that my responsibility is to the Earth. Our generation's war is climate change, so I've really been modifying how I eat and what I eat.","Agriculture is one of the biggest causes of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Cars? Planes? Trains? Nope. Cow farts.","I do wonder if it's my responsibility to spread a message of environmental awareness or political awareness or just, like, don't be racist or whatever, but I don't want to be the person who's like, 'Everyone be vegan forever!'","One day, I'd like to tackle a biopic. I grew up very influenced by Josephine Baker, Billie Holiday, and Nina Simone.","I actually didn't think I was going to do TV because I don't really watch TV. I'm a little bit pretentious, and I do these little indie movies, so I envisioned that more as the path for myself.","I was an only child until I was 15, so I was able to reap the benefit of that.","I always thought my alternative life, if I wasn't acting, would be to become a midwife. I love women. I want to help them exist.","What I crave, and what I want to see on television, is when you see a minority character, not to have it being about them being black or Asian or Latino. If you watch 'Friends,' for example, it's not about a group of people being white. It's about a group of people being friends, you know? You should just let the characters exist.","Growing up I definitely, definitely had a bunch of things of, 'Um, am I black enough?' - and I guess specifically, 'Am I German enough?' Why are we measuring blackness?","Walking in the street, particularly in a city like New York, every single day, I am reminded of how objectified women can be. Being catcalled every day, multiple times a day, all the time... it just constantly happens.","Some people feel like women should dress in a way that doesn't promote attention-seeking. But this is just my body. My body in itself isn't only sexual.","It is so frustrating to feel in danger. People have followed me around at 2 in the morning and have literally said, 'Don't make me follow you. You're not responding to me.' It's incredibly degrading.","I like representing different kinds of black people - showing they exist.","For me, a big thing growing up was naturalness - both in being and appearance. My mom never let me relax my natural hair. For so long, I thought I was ugly, and I still sometimes struggle with that. But now I've come to feel like this is me.","The truth is all kinds of people exist everywhere. So let's tell their stories, too.","I identify with my womanhood before anything else because that's what I deal with when I am alone.","I love babies. I also have this very deep desire to become a mother. I always thought that motherhood was my highest calling.","I think what happens with a lot of writing and art is that specificity ends up being relatable while universality becomes vague.","I've had acting teachers say, 'If you want to do anything else but act, that means you're not an actor,' which I think is stupid!","The version of me on the Internet, it's not me. It's one portion.","I used to work at Cafe Mogador in the East Village. I love Mogador, but I feel like working almost anywhere will kind of ruin it for you. There was a lot of panicking while being a waitress there. I don't like to think about that. But I love the food.","Bad bread is the one thing I refuse. I need good bread.","I wish I was a morning person.","My father is German; my mother is African-American. Growing up, I visited my grandparents in Berlin a lot. I would not see any other person of color for three weeks. People would stare. They would say things like, 'Oh, you look like chocolate - I want to eat you up!'","In the United States, if you're African-American, it can be assumed that your family has been here for generations. In Europe, colonialism is much more alive, and it's assumed you're from Nigeria or Senegal.","When the Berlin Wall came down, my dad left to visit the U.S. He met my mom at this summer camp where they were both working, so I grew up between Washington Heights and Germany speaking two languages.","I don't know how people say exercising is addictive.","I worry about not being able to be myself day to day. But I know people way more famous than me who have been able to do that.","At home in my room, I'm funny, but if I'm commissioned to be that, I don't feel very funny.","It's fascinating working with young children. You have to improvise around them, and they're moving around and doing stuff, and you have to be real with them.","Despite my career, so much of my life has been dictated by what I'm afraid of: fear that I am not talented. Fear that people will finally realize that I am a boring individual who doesn't have many ambitions beyond starting a family 'at a good time' in life.","For me, fear manifests itself in snoozing and inactivity. I just become so sleepy, any time of day, when something needs to be done. I sometimes go days without responding to texts or reading books or being able to process much of anything beyond the sun slowly creeping through my living room windows.","I remind myself that, though there was a time anxiety might have stopped me, today is not that day. And so, by checking in with myself, minute by minute, I push myself through.","I used to cry on planes. I don't anymore. It probably took almost a hundred agonizing flights to get there. Now, when I take off, a smile quivers on the corner of my lips.","I feel like I pull inspiration, in general, from how I feel on a day.","Growing up, my aunts would always put in hair ties and bows and all kinds of stuff, and I always hated it.","I feel like, every six months, I learn my hair or my skin anew and find a new thing that I like to do, and then I abandon it and move on."],"Zbigniew Brzezinski":["Anniversaries are like birthdays: occasions to celebrate and to think ahead, usually among friends with whom one shares not only the past but also the future.","Commitment and credibility go hand in hand.","America's victory in the Cold War was not without painful social costs.","What is most important to the history of the world? The Taliban or the collapse of the Soviet empire? Some stirred-up Moslems or the liberation of Central Europe and the end of the Cold War?","There's no point considering something which is very unrealistic.","You go to Paris, or you go to Portugal, you go to Poland, and you ask, 'Who are you people?' They'll tell you, we're Portuguese, we're Spanish, we're Polish. Who are the people that are really European? The people in Brussels, in the E.U. bureaucracy. Europe has not been able to move to the level of patriotic identification with the concept.","Japan needs the American market and it also needs American security protection. Japan also needs America as the necessary stabilizer of an orderly world system with economies truly open to international trade.","We cannot have that relationship if we only dictate or threaten and condemn those who disagree.","During the twentieth century, men fought on behalf of nationalism. Yet the wars they fought were also engendered by dislocations in world markets and by social revolution stimulated by the coming of the industrial age.","Sometimes in international politics, the better part of wisdom is to defer dangers rather than try to eliminate them altogether instantly.","We can't have an intelligent foreign policy unless we have an intelligent public, because we're a democracy.","You know who's messianic? Netanyahu, because he talks that way. And that's a very risky position.","Basically, I see Iran as an authentic nation-state. And that authentic identity gives it cohesion, which most of the Middle East lacks.","All the historical pretenders to global power originated in Eurasia.","A waning United States would likely be more nationalistic, more defensive about its national identity, more paranoid about its homeland security, and less willing to sacrifice resources for the sake of others' development.","Fear obscures reason, intensifies emotions, and makes it easier for demagogic politicians to mobilize the public on behalf of the policies they want to pursue.","I don't feel I was 'born American,' but my homeland was denied to me after the end of World War II, and I craved something I could identify with. When I became a student at Harvard in the 1950s, America very quickly filled the vacuum. I felt I was American, but I think it's more revealing of America how quickly others here accepted me.","Americans must place greater emphasis on the more subtle dimensions of national power, such as innovation, education, the balance of force and diplomacy, and the quality of political leadership.","Pakistan's political instability is its greatest vulnerability, and a decline in U.S. power would reduce America's ability to aid Pakistan's consolidation and development.","Peace between Israel and Palestine would be a giant step toward greater regional stability, and it would finally let both Israelis and Palestinians benefit from the Middle East's growing wealth.","We have actually experienced in recent months a dramatic demonstration of an unprecedented intelligence failure, perhaps the most significant intelligence failure in the history of the United States.","Bipartisanship helps to avoid extremes and imbalances. It causes compromises and accommodations. So let's cooperate.","Neither the United States nor Israel has the capacity to impose a unilateral solution in the Middle East.","We defended our allies in Europe for 40 years during the worst days of the Cold War - very threatening days of the Cold War - and nothing happened. So deterrence does work.","AIPAC has consistently opposed a two-state solution, and a lot of members of Congress have been intimidated, and I don't think that's healthy.","There's something troubling about a condition in which one country alone, which has roughly 5 percent of the world's population, spends more than 50 percent of the world's defense budgets. There's something weird about it.","The culture of self-gratification and deregulation that began during the Clinton years and continued under President George W. Bush led to the bursting of one stock market bubble at the turn of the century and a full-scale financial crash less than a decade later.","Sovereignty is a word that is used often but it has really no specific meaning. Sovereignty today is nominal. Any number of countries that are sovereign are sovereign only nominally and relatively.","I cite these events because I think they underline two very disturbing phenomena - the loss of U.S. international credibility, the growing U.S. international isolation.","But if Russia is to be part of this larger zone of peace it cannot bring into it its imperial baggage. It cannot bring into it a policy of genocide against the Chechens, and cannot kill journalists, and it cannot repress the mass media.","American power worldwide is at its historic zenith.","The legitimacy of the leadership depends on what that country thinks of its leaders.","We don't have a public that really understands the world anymore, and in the age of complexity, that problem becomes much more difficult.","Terrorism cannot be isolated from its political, historical, and even social context.","I don't approve of the notion that we should be announcing who should step down from the position of a head of a state unless we are seriously prepared to remove that person. But if we are not, if we are being prudent and careful, then let's also be careful with how we talk.","Pessimism about America's future tends to underestimate its capacity for self-renewal.","It is in the U.S. interest to engage Iran in serious negotiations - on both regional security and the nuclear challenge it poses.","The United States should not engage in tit-for-tat polemics directed at its most important allies. That is as demeaning as it is destructive.","I realise that in an electoral campaign, you don't want to antagonise large groups which are highly motivated.","According to the official version of history, CIA aid to the Mujahadeen began during 1980, that is to say, after the Soviet army invaded Afghanistan, 24 Dec 1979.","We now have the opportunity of giving to the USSR its Vietnam war.","We should seek to cooperate with Europe, not to divide Europe to a fictitious new and a fictitious old.","We should be therefore supporting a larger Europe, and in so doing we should strive to expand the zone of peace and prosperity in the world which is the necessary foundation for a stable international system in which our leadership could be fruitfully exercised.","We need to ask who is the enemy, and the enemies are terrorists.","We didn't push the Russians to intervene, but we knowingly increased the probability that they would.","War on terrorism defines the central preoccupation of the United States in the world today, and it does reflect in my view a rather narrow and extremist vision of foreign policy of the world's first superpower, of a great democracy, with genuinely idealistic traditions.","To increase the zone of peace is to build the inner core of a stable international zone.","The first and most important is to emphasize the enduring nature of the alliance relationship particularly with Europe which does share our values and interests even if it disagrees with us on specific policies.","Palestinian terrorism has to be rejected and condemned, yes. But it should not be translated defacto into a policy of support for a really increasingly brutal repression, colonial settlements and a new wall.","Not to mention the fact that of course terrorists hate freedom. I think they do hate. But believe me, I don't think they sit there abstractly hating freedom.","Look at Islam in a rational manner and without demagoguery or emotion. It is the leading religion of the world with 1.5 billion followers.","Let's cooperate and challenge the administration to cooperate with us because within the administration there are also moderates and people who are not fully comfortable with the tendencies that have prevailed in recent times.","It is said that the West had a global policy in regard to Islam. That is stupid. There isn't a global Islam.","Indeed, for almost 10 years, Moscow had to carry on a war unsupportable by the government, a conflict that brought about the demoralization and finally the breakup of the Soviet empire.","In Iraq we must succeed. Failure is not an option.","I think it is important to ask ourselves as citizens, not as Democrats attacking the administration, but as citizens, whether a world power can really provide global leadership on the basis of fear and anxiety?","The 'war on terror' has created a culture of fear in America.","Constant reference to a 'war on terror' did accomplish one major objective: It stimulated the emergence of a culture of fear.","The war of choice in Iraq could never have gained the congressional support it got without the psychological linkage between the shock of 9/11 and the postulated existence of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction.","I have been struck by the pervasive frequency of pompously patriotic ads for the defense industry, usually accompanied by deferential salutations to our men and women who are heroically sacrificing their lives in our defense. Do we really need all of that for our security?","Hard power makes sense under some circumstances. But there's not a universal solution to global problems.","Yes, ISIS is a threat. It's more than a nuisance. It's also in many respects criminal violence. But it isn't, in my view, a central strategic issue facing humanity.","We all have the right to comment about each other.","Foreign policy should not be justified through making oneself feel good, but through results that have tangible consequences.","There may be circumstances in which damaging our relationship with countries over human rights is counterproductive and the benefits to human rights may be very small because of our limited capacity to enforce our stance. That was the dilemma the United States faced after Tiananmen Square.","I'm all in favour of grand important speeches, but the president then has to link his sermons to a strategy.","If we slide into a pattern of just thinking about today, we'll end up reacting to yesterday instead of shaping something more constructive in the world.","Americans don't learn about the world; they don't study world history, other than American history in a very one-sided fashion, and they don't study geography.","The Chinese are really good at diplomacy - and even at making their interlocutors feel very uncomfortable.","If we end up with war in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran at the same time, can anyone see a more damaging prospect for America's world role than that?","The mullahs are part of the past in Iran, not its future. But change in Iran will come through engagement, not through confrontation.","The Soviet Union's termination, which brought to an end the bipolar world, ushered in an era of U.S. hegemony. Hegemony, however, should not be confused with omnipotence. Hegemony is not omnipotence but is certainly preponderance.","The Sino-American competition involves two significant realities that distinguish it from the Cold War: neither party is excessively ideological in its orientation; and both parties recognize that they really need mutual accommodation.","I do think America has made it quite clear that it is in the interest both of America and China to avoid situations in which they will be pushed toward a collision.","A Russia that gradually begins to gravitate toward the West will also be a Russia that ceases to disrupt the international system.","I draw a very clear distinction between populism and democracy.","I think we have to pay attention to the Arab masses not just in the Gulf States, but also in the hinterlands.","The fact of the matter is the Arab elites are more inclined to accommodate our wishes because of certain overlapping interests that are often financial. That is not the case with the Arab masses.","Look: I don't want to live with a nuclear Iran. I would like to make it uncomfortable for them to seek it.","I would like to promote internal change in Iran - which is more likely if we don't fuse Iranian nationalism with Iranian fundamentalism.","If we can deter the Soviet Union, if we can deter North Korea, why on earth can't we deter Iran?","The security link between us and Europe is very important for European security but also for our security.","Moderation and bipartisan consensus go hand in hand.","The difference between the Bush I war against Iraq and the Bush II war against Iraq is that in the first one, we appealed to the sentiments and interests of the different groupings in the region and had them with us. In the second one, we did it on our own, on the basis of false premises, with extremely brutality and lack of political skill.","The problem with the Iranian regime, of course is, one, its unsettling effects on the Sunnis, particularly Saudi Arabia, and, secondly, its potential threat to Israel.","Rushing to war is not a wise course of action.","Saddam Hussein was an odious dictator, but he was also a very effective opponent of Iran. He was also a very effective opponent of al-Qaida.","Economically, we are, to some significant degree, interdependent with Chinese well-being. That is a great asset.","Human affairs require some combination of moral commitment with disciplined political action. And that is what keeps me intrigued and challenged and wanting to influence events.","During the nineteenth century, men died believing in the cause of royalty or republicanism. In reality, much of their sacrifice was rendered on the altar of the new nationalism.","Both World War II and the subsequent Cold War gave America's involvement in world affairs a clear focus. The objectives of foreign policy were relatively easy to define, and they could be imbued with high moral content.","If the United States and China can accommodate each other on a broad range of issues, the prospects for stability in Asia will be greatly increased.","To his credit, Obama has undertaken a truly ambitious effort to redefine the United States' view of the world and to reconnect the United States with the emerging historical context of the twenty-first century. He has done this remarkably well.","World War II and the ensuing Cold War compelled the United States to develop a sustained commitment to Western Europe and the Far East.","Eurasia is home to most of the world's politically assertive and dynamic states.","Eurasia is the world's axial supercontinent. A power that dominated Eurasia would exercise decisive influence over two of the world's three most economically productive regions: Western Europe and East Asia.","It is axiomatic that the security of America and Europe are linked.","The Cold War did end in the victory of one side and in the defeat of the other. This reality cannot be denied, despite the understandable sensitivities that such a conclusion provokes among the tenderhearted in the West and some of the former leaders of the defeated side.","The first 'world' war was in reality the last European war fought by globally significant European powers.","The future is inherently full of discontinuities, and lessons of the past must be applied with enormous caution.","The congressional role in declaring war is especially important not when the United States is the victim of an attack, but when the United States is planning to wage war abroad.","Because America is a democracy, public support for presidential foreign-policy decisions is essential.","A president who aspires to be recognized as a global leader should not personally stake out a foreign-policy goal, commit himself eloquently to its attainment, and then yield the ground when confronted by firm opposition.","Only a dynamic and strategically-minded America, together with a unifying Europe, can jointly promote a larger and more vital West, one capable of acting as a responsible partner to the rising and increasingly assertive East.","The financial catastrophe of 2008 nearly precipitated a calamitous economic depression, jolting America and much of the West into a sudden recognition of their systemic vulnerability to unregulated greed.","The costly unilateralism of the younger Bush presidency led to a decade of war in the Middle East and the derailment of American foreign policy at large.","As America's nuclear strategic monopoly faded, the United States sought to create advantages elsewhere, notably in the peaceful cooperation between the United States and communist China under Deng Xiaoping.","With the decline of America's global preeminence, weaker countries will be more susceptible to the assertive influence of major regional powers.","The potential for regional conflict in the absence of an internationally active America is real.","America's decline would set in motion tectonic shifts undermining the political stability of the entire Middle East.","The worsening of relations between a declining America and an internally troubled Mexico could even give rise to a particularly ominous phenomenon: the emergence, as a major issue in nationalistically aroused Mexican politics, of territorial claims justified by history and ignited by cross-border incidents.","The external Soviet empire lasted 45 years. It is shattered, beyond redemption or repair.","Given the accelerating velocity of history, we should begin charting deliberately the next phase in its trajectory.","War triggers unforeseeable military dynamics and sets off massive political shocks, creating new problems as well as new opportunities.","I was deeply involved in the decision that President Jimmy Carter made to boycott the Olympics in Moscow in 1980.","One-sided national economic triumphs cannot be achieved in the increasingly interwoven global economy without precipitating calamitous consequences for everyone.","War on terrorism reflects, in my view, a rather narrow and extremist vision of foreign policy for a superpower and for a great democracy with genuinely idealistic traditions.","It is important to ask ourselves, as citizens, whether a world power can provide global leadership on the basis of fear and anxiety.","Can we really mobilize support, even of friends, when we tell them that if you are not with us you are against us?","Democrats should insist that a pluralistic democracy such as ours rely on bipartisanship in formulating a foreign policy based on moderation and the nuances of the human condition.","Waging a colonial war in the post-colonial age is self-defeating.","Being a former first lady doesn't prepare you to be president.","The public has been told repeatedly that terrorism is 'evil,' which it undoubtedly is, and that 'evildoers' are responsible for it, which doubtless they are. But beyond these justifiable condemnations, there is a historical void.","Missing from much of the public debate is discussion of the simple fact that lurking behind every terroristic act is a specific political antecedent. That does not justify either the perpetrator or his political cause. Nonetheless, the fact is that almost all terrorist activity originates from some political conflict and is sustained by it as well."],"Ze Frank":["On street corners everywhere, people are looking at their cell phones, and it's easy to dismiss this as some sort of bad trend in human culture. But the truth is life is being lived there.

Even if you love them, they are unpredictable. Dogs are more social, and the way that they attach and bond to us is much more human.","I've been fascinated by the Internet from the very start. In 2001, I had made a funny black-and-white film called 'How to Dance Properly,' a short video of me dancing to a Madonna song. I sent it to 17 of my friends on a Thursday, and by Monday, one million people a day were logging on to view it.","Trust is a confusing thing. It seems so simple, but when you try to pin it down, it can be so elusive.","Let me think about the people who I care about the most, and how when they fail or disappoint me...

Let me extend that generosity to myself.","A good procrastination should feel like you're inserting lots and lots of commas into the sentence of your life.","The naked mole is, like, the ugliest freakin' creature in the world. It is so radically, unbelievably disgusting. And the star-nosed mole is also. It looks like it snorted a firecracker. They live way underground, and to get footage of them is basically impossible.","I don't want to get too philosophical, but in a sense, you're given this gift, this sort of creative force in you, and I think everyone has it, and it's completely unique to you. And you as a person have a little bit of a responsibility as its shepherd if you choose to incorporate that into your life.","For some reason, we stopped getting gold stars at some age. It's time to bring them back.","Most of us yearn for really intimate, healthy, in-person relationships. People have a deep desire to be understood, to be told that it's OK, that you're not isolated and broken, that this is part of the human challenge, and that there is hope. The capacity for online interactions to do that is powerful.","I'm fascinated by simple joy.","I think this is one of the greatest gifts of this era: Because of the Internet, we can start to type a question into Google and watch the question auto-fill. In that moment, we know someone else has asked that same question. The gift of realizing you're not alone is incredibly powerful.","I'm always glad when people come together to help each other - whether they're raising money for somebody in a bad situation or making a creative piece like a song.","I studied neuroscience at the cellular level, so I was looking at learning and memory in the visual cortex of rats. Neuroscience mainly exposed me to a way of thinking - about experimentation, about what you believe to be true and how you could prove it - and how to approach things in a methodical manner.","I've been super impressed with what BuzzFeed has done on Facebook with inspiring list posts and on Twitter with political scoops, but YouTube is a giant social platform that has its own quirks and oddities and will require some new approaches.","Mobile video is now a reality and a force to be reckoned with. I think it is essential to think about how people interact with their phones; how they consume content and how they share.","YouTube has become more mature, both as a platform and as a community. So much content has been added in almost every conceivable category that there are no more free passes on just getting there first. I think there are greater expectations for audience participation, the kind of participation that makes a real impact in a show's community.","Video has become much more social, and as a result, there are many opportunities to use video as a way to connect people, to give them opportunities to play and participate, to make things together and have a shared social experience. I think we are just at the beginning of really exploring what social video is and what we can make of it.","The thing that has always struck me is that there has always been a bit of a hole at YouTube when it comes to authenticity, human emotion, fun and play.","When I was young, I had this feeling that there was this handbook that I had never gotten that explained how to be, how to laugh, what to wear, how to stand by yourself in the hallway. Everyone looked so natural - like they all practiced and knew exactly what to do - even the way they pushed their hair out of their face.","Anything that makes you feel the most alone also has the greatest power to connect you.","I consider creativity to be a more non-rational, subconscious thing. You have a relationship to your creativity - you can feed it with content, with some rational prodding and sleep and things like that, but the mechanisms by which your creativity work are largely unknown.","If you want to get into the creative world, you have to just keep flogging away even when nobody's paying attention. Because then when somebody finally does pay attention, it's certainly a lot more interesting when you have a ton of stuff to show.","The story of technology seems to go up and then retract into simplicity again.","I'm obsessed with media and the way audiences can become creative participants.","We have this incredible ability to communicate with each other. I want to play around with it, see what this mass audience is really capable of.","What better way to connect with people than by staring and talking straight at them? Don't blink - that's one less connection you could have made.","In an ever-changing technological landscape, where today's platforms are not tomorrow's platforms, the key seems to be that any one of these spaces can use a dose of humanity and art and culture.","We can't all be like Ryan Seacrest... the perfect platform manifestation of a human. I don't know if we all have those gifts for restraining our emotions... or whatever it is he does."],"Zebulon Pike":["May Heaven be propitious, and smile on the cause of my country.","Smoke the pipe of peace, bury the tomahawk, and become one nation.","I differ materially from Capt. Lewis, in my account of the numbers, manners, and morals of the Sioux.","Strict justice would demand total confiscation of your property, personal imprisonment and fines.","There had so lately been a large force of Spanish cavalry at the village, which had made a great impression on the minds of the young men, as to their power, consequence, which my appearance with 20 infantry was by no means calculated to remove.","If success attends my steps, honor and glory await my name-if defeat, still shall it be said we died like brave men, and conferred honor, even in death, on the American Name.","Why cannot we correct the baneful passions, without weakening the good?","The village had a mill near it, situated on the little creek, which made very good flour. The population consisted of civilized Indians, but much mixed blood.","The toute ensemble was such as to make polished society blush, when compared with these savages.","It was the wish of the Americans that their red brethren should remain peacefully round their own fires, and not embroil themselves in any disputes between the white people.","If we go to Chihuahua we must be considered as prisoners of war?","He was a man, he always performed his promises.","Your former Fathers the Spaniards have now no further Authority over you.","You have already disarmed my men without my knowledge, are their arms to be returned or not?","With the dreary season in which we travelled part of the route; with our minds much more actively employed in forming resources for our preservation from famine.","They were conspiring to desert us in the night and steal some of our horses... we engaged a spy.","The Spanish troops returned and we could yet discover the grass beaten down in the direction which they went.","The preparations for my new voyage prevented the possiblity of my paying that attention to the correction of my errors, that I should otherwise have done.","The Pawnee chief had left the village the day after the doctor arrived, with 50 or 60 horses and many people, and had taken his course to the north of our route.","Should I be the happy mortal destined to turn the scale of war, will you not rejoice, O my father?","Owing to the difficulty of obtaining horses, Mr. Henry returns from this place. In descending the Mississippi I will request him to pay his respects to you.","On no further occasion present a flag or medal to an Indian.","In my proper character, I am an officer of the United States Army.","I was informed... that some... were dreaming and wished to return.","I cannot consent to be led three or four hundred leagues out of my route, without its being by force of arms.","Give immediate instruction to all your posts in said territory, under your direction, at no time and on no pretence to hoist, or suffer be hoisted, the English flag.","Few Indians only had breech cloths, most being wrapped in buffalo robes, otherwise quite naked.","At the lodge the chief gave me many particulars which were relative to the late visit of the Spaniards.","Among various demands and charges I gave them, was, that the said flag should be delivered to me, and one of the United States' flags be received and hoisted in its place.","American agents... are the only persons authorized to hold councils of a political nature.","A young man who is here speaks the Panis language, and in many other respects, is preferable.","A discontented young fellow, filled with self pride; he certainly should have considered it an honor to be sent on so respectable an embassy as he was."],"Zedd":["A DJ can't just play one song. It's about playing a set, or how you connect songs in those two hours, and where you place them.","Being yourself is what will make you survive through anything. If you make music to please someone, it's the first step in the wrong direction. Always do what you believe in, no matter what people say. Only way to go!","Music is its own language - if you don't speak it, it's hard to say what you're trying to do.","I would never say I will stay in electronic music for the rest of my life. I will always do whatever I feel like at that moment.","I love silence. But I usually only listen to that when I'm sleeping.","If you're convinced as an artist of what you're doing, the only move is to, no matter what people say or what management says or your best friends say or people on Facebook, do what you do, and people will find their way to it.","I used to be a drummer in a band, and I really loved playing the drums, so I look forward to the right opportunity to do that at some point. Maybe even on TV. Every single live performance I'm doing on TV, I want it to be different and unique.","Whenever I'm in the U.K., people say I have an American accent. Which is, obviously, funny.","I always take care to have interesting chord progressions, because you can have the best sound design in the club, and you'll kill it in the club, but in five years, kids will have better sound design. But if your music is good, you'll always be able to listen to it, even in 20 or 50 years.","I will not promote other people's songs big time. I will just mention that I produced the song to get the credit I think I deserve.","I'm my own artist, and I see artists as movies. No one should try to change them for anything. If you don't like it, you just don't follow it. And if you don't like a movie you don't watch it. Watch another movie.","For the longest time, I wanted to become a pianist. That was kinda my thing.","I've always dreamed of having an album. The problem is that it's just very difficult to make an album nowadays because through technology, music shifts so fast, especially electronic music. Once you make five songs, the first one you did is already old and you wished you would have put it out right away. So that's kind of the difficult part.","Although my music is electronic, it has a lot of influences from my past, which is all sorts of genres; I've been in a rock-metal band for a long time, and I still feel like, personally, I have a lot of influence from that. My classical influence, you can find spots here and there.","I never feel like I need to make a song that sells 5 million copies; that's not the point of why I make music. It's great if that happens, like it did with 'Clarity,' but my goal is to always make a better track than the last one.","I really like working with unique and unknown artists, as they usually bring something fresh to a song.","I've been making music for a long time, since I was very young, but at the same time, I'm still exploring what works for me. I feel like I'm just starting out.","I don't want to put 12 singles on an album. I want to make a story, a little movie.","A lot of EDM is not bad at all when it's simple, but a lot of it is not really musical. That's just what I really like to do: taking what I had at the beginning, which is classical and jazz influences, and putting it into electro.","I definitely don't sit down every day and make a new song.","I can't just sit down and make a song in a day. It's only possible if you focus on the music and not the sound.","When you catch other people with a sound like yours, that's when you know you did something.","What I look for in a voice is for it to be unique. I don't really care if a singer sings well. Really, it's about emotion, or being able to sing the lyrics and actually mean it. A lot of singers sing good notes but forget about what words they use.","I usually write my music on a piano, and I really enjoy performing that way, because that actually shows how the music was in my mind before it actually became an electronic song.","I personally see myself as a musician in the first place. You know, I don't want to say I will be a producer and DJ for the rest of my life. I can totally see myself being in another band in five years, if that's what my heart and soul wants to do, if that's what will make me happy. I'm totally happy to just not DJ anymore.","What I don't like to hear in music is something has not been thought through: that a sound is just there randomly. I want to make sure that every single little noise that's in my song is there because it's supposed to be there.","When I played in a band, people just stand there and look at you and criticize what they didn't like. But if you watch a D.J. show, people go crazy from beginning to end. Say what you want against D.J.'s, but you can't deny that the energy level in the audience is for the most part far above what rock bands have."],"Zelda Fitzgerald":["Nobody has ever measured, not even poets, how much the heart can hold.","Mr. Fitzgerald, I believe that is how he spells his name, seems to believe that plagiarism begins at home.","It is the loose ends with which men hang themselves.","We grew up founding our dreams on the infinite promise of American advertising. I still believe that one can learn to play the piano by mail and that mud will give you a perfect complexion.","I don't want to live. I want to love first, and live incidentally.","By the time a person has achieved years adequate for choosing a direction, the die is cast and the moment has long since passed which determined the future.","Youth doesn't need friends - it only needs crowds."],"Zeljko Ivanek":["When you're guest-starring, it's very nice, but you're there very briefly, and it's right there in the name: You're a guest. It's very hard to get a real sense of belonging. With recurring and regular roles, at least you have a sense that this is a home and a steady place.","I thought I'd be doing theater, really. That's all I had experience with growing up. I mean, I saw movies and television, but I don't think I really connected at a young age that that was acting, that that was part of the profession.","Both 'Oz' and 'Homicide,' they're critically admired, so it's not like they're really neglected, but I wish they'd found bigger audiences.","I had such an amazing experience on 'The Pillowman' that it was hard to think what else is going to live up to that.","It's very juicy to twirl your mustache and figure out why people do the horrible things that they do. It's not just because they are evil, but because that's how they somehow explain the world to themselves and justify themselves. It's always interesting figuring out how that happens.","I spend a lot of time in California, but New York is still my main home. I go to see a lot of theater.","I thought I would spent my career doing Chekhov and Ibsen in regional theaters, so the fact that I started doing new plays was a whole new world I didn't expect, and that I would like to keep doing.","The stuff that I find really intriguing is always how do ordinary people behave in extraordinary circumstances. And that's why we have a lot of cop shows and lawyer shows and medical shows is that you're looking for situations that just always heighten the stakes.","What I always loved about theater is that that's an experience that a company of actors just sinks itself into for weeks, and you really get to work on the material, and by the time you're in front of an audience, you really own it.","In television, you are of necessity working in bits and pieces and scenes, and things are out of order, and you never can have the same sense of how will this look when it's all put together, what will the effect be.","I actually love going to a lot of theater movies. I just love watching actors work and seeing how people tell stories.","Movie stars are doing TV series, and former TV stars are doing guest shots. Everybody gets bumped down the line. That's affected everyone in the industry. I've been lucky; I've stayed busy. I'll cross my fingers until it's my turn to be sitting around, not working. I'm sure that'll happen, too.","I had seen 'Pillowman' in London and loved it. Being part of something that I, as an audience member, would like to be part of was one of the greatest experiences I've ever had."],"Zell Miller":["Where I come from, deeds mean a lot more than words.","I can remember when Democrats believed that it was the duty of America to fight for freedom over tyranny.","John Kerry, who says he doesn't like outsourcing, wants to outsource our national security.","There is but one man to whom I am willing to entrust their future and that man's name is George Bush.","Motivated more by partisan politics than by national security, today's Democratic leaders see America as an occupier, not a liberator. And nothing makes this Marine madder than someone calling American troops occupiers rather than liberators.","Twenty years of votes can tell you much more about a man than twenty weeks of campaign rhetoric. Campaign talk tells people who you want them to think you are. How you vote tells people who you really are deep inside.","My family is more important than my party.","For more than 20 years, on every one of the great issues of freedom and security, John Kerry has been more wrong, more weak and more wobbly than any other national figure.","Cover this confirmation process with prayer. When they make it harder for us to pray, we just pray harder."],"Zendaya":["Let's practice motivation and love, not discrimination and hate.","A feminist is a person who believes in the power of women just as much as they believe in the power of anyone else. It's equality, it's fairness, and I think it's a great thing to be a part of.","When you're put in a position to really affect young people who are going to run the world one day, if you're able to be in their life at a young age and make a positive impact, I think that's a beautiful thing.","There are so many great things in life; why dwell on negativity?","I don't think people understand the power of social media or our phones.","I was born an auntie. I have an older niece and nephew and many younger nieces and nephews.","I love playing with makeup. Makeup has become a thing where it's an art form. It's not a thing where you use it because you need to feel beautiful or because you don't like the way you look.","If there's any definition to being perfect, you're perfect at being yourself.","Remember that we are all human beings trying to do what we love to do.","If I'm going to portray one of my idols and someone I feel... so strongly about, it has to be done right, and it has to be done 120 percent.","I didn't like my hair and makeup one time on a photo shoot, and my publicist told me, 'You should just be happy with it - they haven't had a black girl on the cover since forever.' She's no longer my publicist.","It's important to raise your voice in things you feel passionate about and things that you know about. Don't raise your voice just to raise your voice if you have nothing behind it and don't know what you're talking about.","Find something that makes you happy and go for it.","I've never had a body issue; I've never had a self-confidence issue, and there's been very few times in my life where I've felt down about the way I look or the way I feel.","'Shake It Up' definitely teaches kids about the importance of reaching for your dreams and setting high goals. It also teaches great lessons about friendship and family.","Top knots are the easiest thing to create.","My parents got me in trouble when I was in school because someone was getting bullied, and I didn't do anything about it. I just watched it happen and then came to the school, and I got cussed out for not helping and not being a part of it.","I'm a chocolate addict.","Pretty is so boring now. There are so many different definitions of 'pretty.' It's so much broader than before. The old pretty is boring - nobody cares anymore.","There is no such thing as ugly.","Why limit yourself? I feel like I can do anything.","I was actually supposed to be a basketball player, not an actress. My parents had me playing basketball on competitive teams when I was in kindergarten. Even though my heart belongs to the arts, I'm a tomboy at heart, too.","I don't think it is important to be a role model, because if you are a role model, you are pretending to be someone else.","It's hard as a young person of a different ethnicity or background to look at the TV and not see anyone who looks like you. Representation is very important.","I haven't always been confident enough to rock different styles because I used to be really shy.","Age doesn't mean anything. Age doesn't mean I can't work as hard. Age doesn't mean I can't do as well as everyone else. It's just a factor. It's just there.","I think the way we react to things is a big indicator of our character and what type of person we are.","Sticking with your vision and what you believe in is so, so important.","Doing and making positive programming for young people is so important to me, and I will keep doing it.","I use my platform as a tool and a way to speak about greater change.","I love simplicity.","When I was younger, I went through a phase when I didn't like my hair. Because the school I went to was primarily Caucasian, there wasn't anyone who had my hair texture. I remember one day I straightened my hair, and that was the first day that people gave me compliments on it.","A good hair day is when my curls are popping. Sometimes my curls and waves, they like to go a little wild sometimes. They have a mind of their own. But some days, they just fall right into place.","I'm a Virgo, and I know what I like.","Fashion is a great thing, it's a way to express who you are.","One of my dreams is to walk down the runway during Fashion Week!","I am so honored to join the company of a roster as celebrated and diverse as Covergirl's. I can't wait to share some of my own beauty tips with fans and work alongside Covergirl to continue empowering girls and women to celebrate their individuality.","I've always been honest with my fans, and I want to keep that up because I feel they can see through the fakeness.","People always want to doubt you.","I love singing and would love to record an album at some point.","Honestly, I just love great performers and people who love what they do.","I have a phone obsession. It's really hard on set sometimes because I'll be checking Instagram, and then I have to remember, 'Oh, crap, I have to shoot a scene or rehearse.' Every now and then, I have to turn it off and live my life.","I'm excited to be a part of the new direction the Barbie brand is headed, specifically how they are celebrating diversity in the line and encouraging kids to raise their voices.","Of course I've had a problem with people taking me seriously because of my age. People are always going do that because you're less experienced; you haven't lived as much.","Oakland kids are always the best.","I have parents and family who will never allow me not to be grounded. If I thought for a second that I could possibly lift off the ground, I have a thousand people who will grab my ankles.","I talk about Beyonce too much. I am a diehard.","I wore a mullet to the Grammys! I have no fear.","What hasn't Barbie been? I don't think I can create an occupation that she has not done yet.","The greatest of the greats wouldn't be the greatest of the greats if they didn't try stuff, you know what I mean?","I love all types of braids. Single, multiple, box braids - I try them all.","I would say that 'Shake It Up' was a chance for me to do two things I really love: acting and dancing.","My mother's proud of where she's from, and her history, and her past, and same with my dad. I have roots in Africa. Like, I am from Africa as well as from Germany, and I am very proud of that.","I love my fashion, so I gotta have my outfits.","I was that weird eight-year-old who was really interested in Shakespeare and understood it and appreciated the language.","I remember 'Hannah Montana' came out, and I was so depressed, I started crying because I was like, 'I want to do that.'","I've had a lot of voices tell me what I should be making. Personally, I would much rather live and die by my own hand. If my stuff sucks, then at least I made it suck. I didn't allow some person, some old dude in a suit, to make it suck for me.","X Out has helped me keep up my confidence, and I know it can help anyone who would rather have fun than worry about blemishes. If you want clear, seriously good-looking skin, X Out is for you.","To all the parents out there, thank you for allowing me to be a role model for your children. I really, really do not take that for granted.","I was taught as a young child by my parents and family to love myself.","A lot of people don't realize that hair is a big thing for a lot of people, not just African-American women. It's something to be aware of and to be cautious of.","All my brothers and my dad at one point had dreadlocks.","I'm a little girl; no one wants to beat up on me.","My mom started working at the California Shakespeare Theater in Oakland when I was two years old, so I've always grown up around theater.","Everyone loves Beyonce. If you don't love Beyonce, we can't talk.","My older brothers and sisters have kids and families.","My grown man crush is Morris Chestnut. He's just timeless!","I love Channing Tatum!","I secretly want to shave my head.","Beautiful updos with natural hair are great!","I think when you're young, you're a lot more open-minded, and sometimes you're a lot more perceptive about what's going on in the world.","When I first started out in the industry, I was 12 or whatever, and I wanted to be on something so bad, and I didn't know what I was going to be on. At the time, I was in school, and I was working on drama and theatrical stuff, so I never thought that I'd end up going to comedy.","I think, more than anything else, my dog's death has made me grow up. I find myself thinking about the world in a more serious way.","As a kid, my main interest was dancing. When I was 8 years old, I was in a hip-hop troupe.","My room used to be full of Michael Jackson posters.","I've loved Michael Jackson since the minute I was born. He's probably the most talented person ever. He was able to create such an amazing career and be probably the biggest star we've ever had.","As I've gotten older, I've realized my true models are my parents. My mom is like a sheroe. My dad is so strong.","My generation, we really have to step up to the plate and vote. Tweeting is great - people say, 'Oh, I don't want this or that' - but at the end of the day, tweeting isn't a ballot. Just saying that you don't like someone on Twitter is not going to turn a state blue or red. You have to vote.","The only way I was going to come back to the Disney Channel was if I was in a position of more power.","I want to make affordable shoes of quality that are very fashion forward, chic, and that I'm going to wear.","I feel that if you shelter your kids from everything, one day they are going to be out in the world on their own, and they are going to have to figure it out. You can't give them a test if you never taught them anything that's on the test. They're going to fail.","Braids are not new. Black women have been wearing braids for a very long time.","My mom actually taught fifth grade, so... I'm good with fifth graders. That's, like, my specialty.","As an artist, you have to work really, really hard because you gotta make something that will allow people to even take the chance to even listen to it, you know?","I definitely enjoy working with people who can do their thing but also allow me to do my thing, you know? Who respect the process.","I shampoo every other day and only do the roots. I can't shampoo all the way down to the end, because it will dry my hair out. I use a mask multiple times a week to restore moisture.","I can't do chapped lips. If your lips are jacked up, Aquaphor is always a good go-to.","You'd be surprised how self-conscious a lot of women are. That's something I've witnessed firsthand.","There are things that people say that hurt my feelings or whatever, especially with social media right now. It can be the most amazing thing, and it can also be the most negative and detrimental thing.","There's no such thing as trends. There's no such thing as style, even. It's just whatever you feel.","What is cool today is not going to be cool tomorrow, and what wasn't cool yesterday is going to be cool tomorrow.","I did kindergarten twice because I was so shy.","My first part in a play was one of the witches in 'Macbeth.'","My dad wouldn't let me date until I was 16.","I realized that if I don't like something, I can change it. If I don't feel comfortable with something, then I have a voice to say it's not cool.","As you grow older, your music begins to mature and grow older along with you.","I'm not good at a lot of things. I am not good at keeping my room clean. I am not good at eating healthy. I am not good at sports anymore. I used to be! Not so much anymore.","Some things are really sacred and important to other cultures, so you have to be aware, politically, about those things before you just adopt them.","Usually, I just don't care what I look like. If it's cold, I'm, like, putting on whatever I have to to be warm.","Why trip off some random person in Idaho that doesn't feel my vibe? Like, no thank you. Stay in your life; I'll stay in mine.","There were a lot of times people would do my makeup, and it would be awful, and I would be orange. Nothing matched.

So as long as I'm not traveling, I'm always with them and I go to their soccer and tennis matches.","On the weekends, I do the usual parental things, going to the boys' football tournaments or getting out for a hike along the Great Wall.","I find it hard to be labelled in this new 'super-rich' category because we all grew up with very little. The idea that 'to get rich is glorious' is really a new phenomenon. I certainly didn't grow up like that.","It's not easy to be my sons because we're very high profile. We try so hard to give them a normal life. I'm very, very tight with them about money. I don't give that money until they ask, 'I need 100 yuan for my lunch card,' and so on.

We know that the dispositions of these outer barbarians are as ravenous as those of wolves.","The dependencies of inner and outer Mongolia are the bulwarks of China. The desert of Gobi, stretching for ten thousand li, is a barrier set by Heaven to the Russians, and if they seek to invade our borders, they will find it everywhere along the Northern frontier difficult and troublesome.","Sincerity is the norm of Heaven and the law of our nature. China and the West agree on this point, for without sincerity, no human prince could ever found a state, and no earthly teacher could ever establish a religion.","Primary education was in the first place to teach people to be good people. Only secondary education teaches people to also be useful people.","In order to defend the Chinese race, one must first defend the Confucian culture; and in order to defend the Confucian culture, one must first defend the State.

How could we possibly assign important offices and heavy responsibilities to someone who cannot even write fluently?","In the schools of the Western countries, there is always the subject 'Religion.' The Classics are China's religion.","People who have got to know Western educational methods always claim that the reading of the Classics was a useless waste of time and should be abolished. Such chatter is to be heard from hundreds of people and cannot be stopped. But it is a serious mistake.","Without knowing about flexibility, one cannot work out strategies to deal with the enemy and prepare for changes, and without knowing about the foundation of one's own culture, one would be contemptuous of the Confucian ethical codes.","Chinese learning is an internal learning, but Western learning is an external one; Chinese learning is for the cultivation of oneself, just as Western learning is for the handling of worldly affairs.","Without numerous schools offering hands-on opportunities, no commander will be cultivated.","Examine the history of China for 2,000 years back, and then compare it with the Western history of fifty years!

We can fight during any of the four seasons, so we have the weather on our side.","The navigation of our inland waters has for years been sought in vain by foreign countries, and if we grant the privilege to Russia, other States will be guided in their demands by her example.","With foreign officials come foreign merchants, and with foreign merchants come foreign soldiers. They will usurp our authority and influence to begin with, and in the course of time, our guests will have become our hosts.","I understand that the tendency of foreign countries in recent years has been to establish particularly close relations with one or two others among all the countries which have general relations.

Each director has his own way of pushing you towards improving yourself.","Ordinarily if an actor gets chosen for the lead in a film, he or she has already built up a repertoire, and everyone knows what he or she is capable of.","There are actors who spend 20 years working and still don't achieve what I've achieved so quickly.

It's part of our culture.","My dream is to live a good life and be loving, be close to God and be a good human being and bring peace to people.","The sun is always shining. We have oxygen, trees, birds. There's so much good things on Earth, still. We haven't destroyed everything.","Reggae has a philosophy, you know? It's not just entertainment. There's an idea behind it, a way of life behind the music, which is a positive way of life, which is a progressive way of life for better people.","God is like the sun. When the sun shines, it shines for everyone. God is for everyone.","Everyone will someday be judged for what they do, and Jah is the only judge.","Doing something that is productive is a great way to alleviate emotional stress. Get your mind doing something that is productive.","Fitness has always been one of the top priorities in my life because that's the way I grew up, with soccer being the sport of choice.","My whole family is spiritual. My grandmother, grand aunt, cousins, they're all preachers and pastors. Spirituality is a part of my family, from generations ago.","Social revolutions and group revolutions are good, and we need that, but we also need personal revolution - revolution within ourselves that change who we are as people.","Jamaica has problems; America has problems; everywhere has problems.","I never did feel any pressure in Jamaica. You just someone, not nobody big.","The roots of my music start from the ghetto.","I think the people should have a right to boycott whoever they want to boycott without the government making them into criminals and try to protect corporations from people. They should protect people from corporations.","I am a leader, so leaders always get heat. They're always going against the grain. Jimi Hendrix got heat; Bob Marley got heat; Miles Davis got heat. Every great artist got heat. Heat means you're doing something right.","Screaming, it's not me. I tried it before! Action is more my thing. Not talking. It's hard for me to have word fights, fighting with words. I'd rather just listen.","'She Wolf,' by Shakira, makes you want to let go of your inhibitions and jam.","I would look at a dog and when our eyes met, I realized that the dog and all creatures are my family. They're like you and me.","I follow the universe; I follow G-d. G-d made the sun, and the sun shines on everyone.","In my songs, the sex is all subliminal. It's subliminal, spiritual.","Running is a part of my medicine. It's what helps relieve my stress, and it's what helps me get away from the concerns of business and anything else that's going on in my life that I need to escape from at times - to find who I am. Running really helps me with that.","I left Jamaica for a while, because as an artist I need to experience different things, see the world, have different energies. Living in one place is not good for me.","I like doing nothing, actually. Doing nothing is better thing when I am not working.","If it is, it is, If it's not, it's not.","If religion had a good purpose, then man would have created something great. But we're man: we mess up everything. We mess up nature. We mess up God. We take what is given to us and make it into what we think it should be.","The political system is not for the people. The people are secondary to the economy. It's about what generates money, not about what benefits the people.","This dragonfly came up to me. He was hovering right in front of my face, and I was really examining him, thinking, How does he see me? I became enlightened.","URGE is a grassroots charity. We organized to get some incubators to give to the hospital for the kids. We donate money to orphanages.","In Jamaica, we eradicated polio many years ago, but there are a lot of kids suffering in Africa still.","A record is a message, timeless.","Hemp is a part of the cannabis plant, and it is very useful.","Love is a positive effect. Love can never have a negative effect, only a positive effect.","Children are the world's future, and we need to take care of them like we would any precious resource.","The long-term study of GMO foods is going on in real time and in real life. Not in a lab.","I am a leader. Leaders always get heat. They're always going against the grain. Jimi Hendrix got heat; Bob Marley got heat; Miles Davis got heat. Every great artist got heat. Heat means you're doing something right.","I am expressing myself truthfully. That is an important thing.","I am not reggae, I am me. I am bigger than the limits that are put on me. It all has to do with the individual journey.","I don't care what you play, where you're from, who you produce. It depends on what you're doing when you're with me. That's what counts. I don't pre-judge anything or anybody.","I don't think we should do anything that should make the people hate the American people more.","I just got into the Beatles a couple years ago, you know, I like it.","I like Flea, I like him as a musician.","I prefer the country life. I live in Kingston, but there is lots of trees.","I rented a house, recorded the stuff in a house. Just took my time 'cuz sometimes it's just rush, rush, rush. I just wanna live and play music.","I think it's wrong the way they criminalize herb. There are many more uses than just smoking. Beneficial to mankind.","I think my type of personality has all music inside of it, so I am full of music, without even knowing it, without even learning it, without even hearing it.","I used to have this little mouse. I buy birds from the pet store and I let them go.","I was in my yard and thought that the tree was a living being. We take trees for granted. We don't believe they are as much alive as we are.","I'm always in love.","I'm not an American, Do they count the votes in America? I haven't voted in Jamaica either.","I've opened up more by traveling outside Jamaica. It helps me to grow as a person to be outside of my element; to be on my own in a strange place meeting people.","I've tried body surfing. It's nice.","It's that kind of in-born music thing - I could pick up the guitar and play something. It's not something I consciously do.","Last time I was in Jamaica I financed a teacher to teach in an orphanage.","Love is more than one thing.","Religion has become so many different things. Religion is an economic thing for some people. Religion is a gun.","The more I grow as an artist, the more I think I become like my father as an artist. The more I diversify, the more I become like my father, which is true to who he was.","The music I do is food... that will be your dinner.","There is a physical relationship with a woman that you don't have with anybody else, but that's not about love. Love is a spiritual thing.","There's more to life than physical and material.","When people come to Jamaica, we don't want them to think about the problems of Jamaica. So let them come be in their paradise.","Working on my own gave me a chance to take my time and experiment a lot.","Yoga is a great thing and meditation is also great to get connected to yourself more.","My father, his spirit is with me constantly, and I'm a believer in that world and the world of dreams and that stuff.","I make music that I know that people will enjoy, and balance the ideas and philosophy that we put in music with music that when we play it live, people can move to it and groove to it.","Proud about my father? What am I most proud of? I think I'm proud of the legacy he left I think is what it is. He has left us so much.","We believe in the almighty and we believe in God and that music is from God and we're inspired by God to give messages and ideas to people.","Everything, I just wanted to be like my father. And, as I grew within the music, I kind of became myself which was even more like my father, only without me trying though.","Today, music is great for entertainment, but it is lacking soul; it's lacking substance, and it's difficult to find good stuff. There are too many corporate interests. It's not about the actual music because it's about the corporation, and music just becomes part of a package."],"Zilpha Keatley Snyder":["Books were the window from which I looked out of a rather meager and decidedly narrow room onto a rich and wonderful universe. I loved the look and feel of books, even the smell... Libraries were treasure houses. I always entered them with a slight thrill of disbelief that all their endless riches were mine for the borrowing.","I seemed to have been born reading.","Writing for children hadn't occurred to me when I was younger, but nine years of teaching in the upper elementary grades had given me a deep appreciation of the gifts and graces that are specific to individuals with 10 or 11 years of experience as human beings.","At the age of eight I became, in my own eyes at least, a writer.","I think writing is an extension of a childhood habit - the habit of entertaining oneself by taking interesting bits of reality and building upon them.","There are several peculiarities that I share with children which, like having no front teeth, are perhaps more acceptable in the very young, but which, for better or worse, seem to be a part of my makeup.","Teaching in the upper elementary grades had given me a deep appreciation of the gifts and graces that are specific to individuals with ten or eleven years of experience as human beings. It is, I think, a magical time - when so much has been learned, but not yet enough to entirely extinguish the magical reach and freedom of early childhood."],"Zinedine Zidane":["It doesn't matter how many times you win an award, it is always very special.","Real Madrid is the most important thing that happened to me, both as a footballer and as a person.","Life is full of regrets, but it doesn't pay to look back.","It was my father who taught us that an immigrant must work twice as hard as anybody else, that he must never give up.","We must not let ourselves get driven off course, no matter what happens we must stick to our natural game.","The door can never be closed for good to any player.","I have a need to play intensely every day, to fight every match hard.","I may have had a lot of luck in my life, but I still need to find a challenge in the game.","I am proud of where I come from and never forget the people I grew up with. Wherever I go, La Castellane is where I want to go back to.","I was lucky to come from a difficult area. It teaches you not just about football but also life.","I was lucky to come from a difficult area. It teaches you not just about football but also life. There were lots of kids from different races and poor families. People had to struggle to get through the day.","The only important thing I have to say is that my father never fought against his country.","I love Madrid. I am happy to be here. I have been here three years and hope to be here longer. But I am proud of where I come from and never forget the people I grew up with.","It's the first time it's happened to me and maybe the last. It's a strange sensation, not normal for me. I can't remember scoring three goals, even when I was a kid.","Obviously fashion is a completely different world from football.","My father is an Algerian, proud of who he is and I am proud that my father is Algerian.","We'll do it, we'll do it.","I'm very inspired by him-it was my father who taught us that an immigrant must work twice as hard as anybody else, that he must never give up.","My memories of events and games are fragmented.","Sometimes words are harder than blows.","I have won many awards and I am very happy about this, but I am not the best player in the world.","Music was important. Football was the easy part.","It will be a physical encounter but we must not respond in kind.","I am first of all from La Castellane and Marseille.","I don't know if we are the best team in the world. I am lucky to be playing alongside some of the best players around. It's a dream.","I have never had the opportunity to play in England, so I know little about it.","I have no message.","The England team must always be respected. They always fight to the end.","To be recognised by a whole country is incredible.","We were a family who had come from nothing and now we had respect from French people of all sorts.","A Mediterranean city is really my culture.","My passion for the game comes from the city of Marseille itself. Unfortunately I can't go back there as much I want to because I play a lot here and abroad.","I have decided to come back for Les Bleus.","We are well aware of the task ahead of us in what will be a very difficult match but which we all dream of playing.","Football boots are very technical and have lots of specific requirements.","I love Madrid.","I am supposed to set an example to young players.","There are evil people, and I don't even want to hear those guys speak.","When your own fans whistle and jeer, then you have a big problem.","I think Marseille is probably a place like Liverpool, very vibrant and very tough."],"Ziyi Zhang":["I wanted to become a kindergarten teacher like my mother.","My parents sent me to a dance class, so it was a road chosen by them, not me. But I enjoyed it so much I knew I would become a performer.","In China, we don't consider someone truly beautiful until we have known them for a long time, and we know what's underneath the skin.","China's cinema has been rising for some time; it has more exposure, so my chances of becoming internationally known are better. But the first thing I have to do is learn English. If I can grasp the language, then perhaps I can think about the U.S.","It's not that I wanted to be an actor; it's that I didn't want to be a dancer! I was trained in traditional Chinese dance, and after working so hard it seemed unfair to just disappear into a group.","Whatever you see - any good results - are all from the pressure.","I knew nothing about martial arts. And I don't really like it! But in the film, I not only had to pretend that I knew all about it, I had to be the best at it. That was very difficult.","I suspect people always thought I had a boyfriend, so nobody came after me.","Chinese women are much more modest than American women when it comes to clothes. We tend to show less flesh.","Even though I've done Hollywood films, I still don't think of myself as a Hollywood actress.","I always think it's really hard if you are Asian or Chinese to be really in Hollywood. There are not so many really great characters for you.","I really want to do something in Europe. With a small movie, it can be an interesting challenge. But I have to get the right project. I don't think it's so important to go to Hollywood. All that trash that comes out of there! I don't want to do that.","Working in Hollywood, it's clear the more money you have, the more technology you can get. So you can build a whole Japanese set. Only in Hollywood!","I want, through my roles, to express the parts in the hearts of Chinese women that they feel unable to let out.","I've discovered that I value simplicity above all in dressing. I don't like anything I wear to be too complicated or fussy.","There's nothing in Chinese culture that is an equivalent of the geisha. It's so different, so special to Japan.","I was really interested in geishas' work, and wanted to meet real geishas.","For myself I don't like the geisha look. It's like a mask.","My profession has helped me to grow up."],"Zlatan Ibrahimovic":["Nothing is written in stone, as a career is an unpredictable journey.","I do not need a trophy to tell myself that I am the best.","Some things is made by destiny, yes, other things by hard work, but quality you don't learn. Quality you are born with.","One thing is for sure: a World Cup without me is nothing to watch.","Anything that happens in your life was meant to happen. It is your destiny. I was destined to have the life I have now, and I can't have any regrets.","I read all the time that people think I'm arrogant. They say I am cocky, a bad character. I had that from a young age. But when they meet me, they say, 'That image doesn't fit you.'","I think I'm like wine. The older I get, the better I get.","I think I am difficult to satisfy, because when I win something, I'm already thinking about the next step, and that is maybe a problem for me. I'm not enjoying the moment. I'm already on the mission to win the next trophy.","That's my hunger. If I start to relax, and I lose that, then I had better stop my football. I need that hunger. I still feel I need to do things 10 times better than other players. Just to be accepted and to improve myself.","Arsene Wenger asked me to have a trial with Arsenal when I was 17. I turned it down. Zlatan doesn't do auditions.","If I had an ego as big as the Eiffel Tower, would I have won this many collective trophies? I know people like to talk about it. And O.K., I am not going to answer every story. But maybe I will let my collective trophies speak for themselves. I don't know many other footballers who have won as much. Do you?","Who is most deserving of all of the money that I, Zlatan, am paid? The answer is Zlatan.","Wherever I go, people recognize me, call my name, cheer me.","If anything, the children of Paris should be giving me even more money for having the privilege of being in the same city as my incredible quality. And so should David Beckham. Call it a Zlaritable donation.","People trash talk me.","I have a big heart.","Lionel Messi is awesome.","When people criticize me, instead of putting my head down, it gives me energy to do even more.","I can't help but laugh at how perfect I am.","If you are different, or you have minimum possibilities, you can still succeed. I am living proof of that.","When you buy me, you are buying a Ferrari. If you drive a Ferrari, you put premium petrol in the tank, you hit the motorway, and you step on the gas.","I am a guy who likes those who drive through red lights.","I did many stupid things. I made many mistakes, but I learnt from everything. I still make mistakes; I still learn from them. Nobody is perfect.","I decide my future. I decide what I want to do. Nobody else. If I decide this will be my last year, maybe it is. If I decide it will be my last contract, I decide that. Nobody else. So I will decide when the moment is there.","I always put myself second - I like to make others happy.","You never forget where you come from.","Some coaches prefer players who will just do whatever he tells them to. It's like, if you're at school with a load of 10-year-old boys and you tell them to jump, everyone will start to jump. But the intelligent boy will ask, 'Why should I jump? Why?' That can be difficult for a lot of coaches, and I understand that.","I wish anyone in this world could go to his fridge and pick whatever he wants. Because the day you open your fridge and there is nothing in it, it is difficult.","When I went to Juventus, I was young, but in training, I had legends like Fabio Cannavaro and Lilian Thuram marking me. I had to work hard to get my respect.","I'm not someone who feels settled.","When I arrived at Barcelona, I was following a dream, but I now realize sometimes it's better to be content with what you have rather than follow a dream which nearly kills you.","I know I'm good enough. I don't need to show it to you. Either you know who I am, or you don't.","I always want to become better. If never being satisfied is a problem, then I have it. At least it's a good problem.","If you are too nice, you will just get eaten alive. The football world is not always a nice place.","You were born as the one you are.","The way that I opened the door for the young people that come from where I come from and that have a different background, that is what I want to be remembered for.","Never judge a person if you don't know him.","Whenever life's at a standstill, I need some action.","People often write after they finish their career, or they don't play anymore, or they are not anymore active. So I say, why do that? And let's do it differently.","When you are the invisible man to the head coach, the only option is to head for the exit.","I'm used to having a camera in my face but not a camera following me.","I had time with my mother, but I really lived with my father. One time he gave all his salary so I could travel to a training camp. He couldn't pay the rent, but he did that.","When I took my shirt off against Caen, everybody asked what these new tattoos were. I had 15 removable tattoos on my body; they are the names of real people who are suffering from hunger in the world.","Do you know what I love about hunting? That I am no one in the woods, no one at all. I thought the animals might recognize me, but they didn't. They did not even ask me for any autographs.","Every player needs a little time to adjust to new teammates and the mentality of the coach when you change clubs.","I will not look back and say, 'I should have played in England.'","I'm like the wine. The older I get, the better I get.","I want to be remembered as the football player I was. The private person is nobody's business.","Jose Mourinho is a big star... he's cool.","It is nice to know that even David Beckham doesn't have good taste in everything.","My father is from Bosnia, and my mother is from Croatia, but I was born in Sweden.","I always drive like a madman.","I'm a guy of 92kg. I haven't got the physique of someone who can work back and then sprint up front again throughout a match!","People are very curious and have written a lot of things about me. Right or not. I never comment on those things, because it's not much of my thing to comment on everything that's written about me.","Best player I ever played against? I mean, I played against many, many good players, so I don't know who to keep. I would say Ronaldo the Fenomeno.","I don't like to talk about myself.","An injured Zlatan is a pretty serious thing for any team.","One time I got dressed in all black, Rambo-style, and took a massive pair of bolt-cutters and nicked a military bike.","Everybody tries to score a great goal, and I am lucky I have netted a few.","At Barca, players were banned from driving their sports cars to training.","When I started to play football, when I was around 15, 16, I remember the players that played on the national team and noticed that it was only typically Swedish guys.","I got a bike when I was little, a BMX. I called it 'Fido Dido' after the tough little cartoon guy with spiked hair. I thought he was the coolest thing ever.","I respect the Premier League.","The day I leave Paris is the day I go down a level or quit football.","I'm not difficult to work with, trust me.","I still feel I need to do things 10 times better than other players. Just to be accepted and to improve myself.","I would love to play alongside Wayne Rooney. He does the running of two or three players and makes a lot of space. We would be the perfect combination.","When you have my confidence, I will do 200% for you.","If I'd gone into taekwondo, I'd probably have won several Olympic medals.","My confidence can come back very quickly.","I do love cars.","I am happy in Paris."],"Zoe Cassavetes":["Talking to other people who make low-budget movies, everyone kind of has the same struggle.","I work hard and support myself.","I'm not complaining about my life; every moment of it has been fantastic, and I'm so lucky.","I got to grow up in an incredibly artistic family.","People are going to say what they want to say.","As a writer, I wouldn't know how to not take things out of my life.","I love when I'm writing and I'm cringing because I know I'm doing something right."],"Zoe Foster Blake":["An anniversary is a reminder as to why you love and married this person.","Life isn't always really glamorous and fabulous. It's about encouraging people to go back to natural beauty.","We live a happy life, and we don't take anything too seriously.","Lipstick is always in, whether it's matte, creamy, glossy, and so on.","I guess the headline is that you mustn't tough it out assuming it's 'normal' to feel incredible pain when you're preggo or post-partum, or be afraid to try a new specialist or a new kind of specialist if you have pain that isn't getting any better.","I had gross morning sickness til about 15 weeks and then gestational diabetes, and most annoyingly, from about week 20, I had pelvis issues, which saw me on crutches for the last five weeks of the pregnancy and has since developed into full-blown Osteitis Pubis and pelvic instability.","It's important to show each other your marriage is a priority.","It'll seem convenient 'cause I am ambassador for the charity, but Look Good Feel Better launched a set of makeup brushes through Priceline, and I use the multi-tasking brush to apply my liquid foundation. It's wonderful. As good as the Bobbi Brown Full Coverage Face brush, which I also use.","Marriage isn't always cupcakes and Jesus juice, but it's important to show each other your marriage is a priority and that you still love them.","I'm obsessed with brows, so Revlon's ColorStay Eyebrow Liner is a must, and the Just Bitten Kissable Balm Stain in Rendezvous is another obsession.","When I first have an idea, I'll spit-ball it with my husband: he's my beautiful ideas sounding board. I usually have a year deadline from start to finish, so I'll piss about for three months and pretend to get started. Then there's four to six months of actual writing and, after that, submissions, edits, and eventually a finished product.","Hamish and I rarely go to launches or parties any more but prefer to spend our time hanging out together.","I didn't even know what a beauty editor was. It sounds like a fictional job if you think about it. You get to test lipstick and perfume and nail polish legitimately and call it work.","I was writing blogs before work, then I was writing at work, and then I started writing books on the weekend because you just have that sort of energy in your 20s; it's wonderful.","Obviously there's a lot more to a TV show than just a book... I think adaptations are a bit tricky for the screenwriters because they're worried about upsetting the author.","Black liner around the eye makes your eyes look smaller. I think you should reassess, if you're a really big black liner user, maybe even just doing the top line, not lower, or try a brown or a plum or even a navy.","I really like funny women. I'm drawn to women like Tina Fey and Amy Poehler and Kristen Wiig, Amy Schumer. They're writers, they're producers, they're actresses. They're brilliant, funny, excellent women.","You're allowed to work hard and have good things and do good things.","I had a free-range childhood. We lived in town but with a cow, chooks, bees, and multiple veggie gardens so we could live self-sufficiently.","I was the youngest and on my own a lot. I think this probably taught me independence and how to be okay with my own company. Also, it meant I read a lot.","I'm bad; I wear trainers with everything: with a dress, skirts, all of that.","I think because Sport Lux has come in and leisure wear is a new thing, girls can sneak in hoodies and leggings and so on where they wouldn't normally - it has been proper legitimate fashion.","I want anything I produce to be good for people kind enough to try it, but it's the momentum and process I enjoy most.","I wish I could do 50 projects a year.","I thought I'd have the baby, and get super fit and strong straight away.","I used to write fiction, non-fiction, fiction, non-fiction and have a clear pattern because I'd need a break from one style when going into the next book.","No one reads my books until they're finished because I don't want feedback. It confuses me, and it changes things; if I get too much feedback, I get thrown off my path.","I've written everywhere - in hotel rooms, cafes, airports, and planes all around the world. Now I have a home office, and the wi-fi is really bad down there, which is great. If I make a date with myself to write from, say, 6 A.M. to 10 A.M. on a Saturday, the fact that no emails come in helps me focus.","I'm pedantic about lip balm. I've been chomping through Lip Smackers since age 11. So the lip balm called Lips! is a personal favourite. I also really love the Properly Clean cleanser. Women are wearing primer, sunscreen and makeup, so a cleanser needs to work hard these days.","My favourite colours have always been '60s Miami-inspired gold and peach - feminine but not too girlie.","Napoleon's The One Concealer is amazing. Pantene Styling Treatment Foam makes my stupid-crazy hair behave, and I love hair powders such as Aveda Pure Abundance and Batiste Dry Shampoo.","The selfie phenomenon is enormous, and it's hilarious. Especially as Australians, because we kind of hate people that love themselves, but that's all flipping on its head now, and we're happy to love ourselves.","At 9 P.M., everything goes off - and it's hard. But it's something you've got to do. I'm wasting my life.","People are intrigued when they discover you date a footballer - women especially.","As with any moderately famous person, footballers are the source of much gossip. In fact, I'd go as far as to say they are targeted. The fun part as their partner is not knowing who, or what, to believe.","There are perks to being the partner of a professional athlete - we were invited into beautiful homes, enjoyed stunning sponsor cars, got special treatment at restaurants, and attended many exquisite functions.","I saturate freshly washed hair with thickening spray (R+Co). Then, using a Denman/styler brush and my Parlux, I brush and blow-dry the hair all over my head, in every direction, until it's 80 percent dry. This gives atomic body and a great foundation for styling in the morning.","Use a corrector to do all the heavy lifting under the eyes, not concealer. I spent years re-applying and layering concealer and Touche Eclat under there, when what I really needed was a good, peachy-toned corrector.","Women will use a glycolic acid cleanser, then an AHA/BHA serum, then a retinol night cream and sure, they have glowing skin, but that's the equivalent of a mini-peel each night. Go easy on your skin! Get good advice! We have finite layers!","The morning is always my best time of the day for writing because that's when my head is best.","By mid-morning, I take a break from my novel and work on my Sunday Style column, which is about pop culture and what I find on the web. I usually start writing it at the beginning of the week and give it a couple of days to marinate before I return to it.","Hamish is worried about ending up like my parents, who each spend time in their two homes in Bundanoon and Sydney. But that's how their marriage has lasted.","Now my goal is to be strong. I get two classes in a week, and they'll be either barre or reformer Pilates."],"Zoe Kazan":["Nothing's going to come to you by sitting around and waiting for it.","I have mad luck. I'm super-good at games like backgammon or anything that requires rolling dice.","I encourage everyone to read James Baldwin and Malcom X and Aldous Huxley. To read Primo Levi. To read 'Silent Spring.' To read Toni Morrison. To read Zora Neale Hurston.","I don't like pretentious films or pretentious people.","I always wrote. My parents are writers. It just seemed like something people did.","I took a writing class in college, liked it, and my first year out of school I couldn't get a job, so I wrote a play.","I never wanted to be a playwright.","I think action should be revealed through character, so if you have a plot problem, it's probably a character problem.","And I think the female creative urge is intrinsically biologically linked to our ability to give birth to a child, even if we've never... I've never given birth, but I feel like it's part of our psychology.","I really love people. I love to meet people. I'm curious about people.","I think movies have much more magic than the theater. Theater can be a magical experience, but movies thrust their subjectivity on you in a more profound way.","And when I get bored, it's like the worst parts of me come out. I really veer to self-destructive tendencies quickly.","When I look back, I can say that the summer when I was 19 was a formative time for me. But at the time I just thought I was making tofu every night for dinner and going to work.","I'm used to very low-budget situations. In 'The Exploding Girl,' we were literally changing in Starbucks because we didn't have trailers.","My schedule is completely different doing a play than it is doing a movie, and I actually think it's a much harder schedule because you've got to do it eight times a week and you've got to do it good eight times a week and with different kinds of audiences who are cold or drunk or tired, whatever it is.","I think most actors jump at the chance to do something where the camera's on them all the time.","I've always really been interested in the Pygmalion myth and both what it has to say about creativity and what it has to say about relationships between men and women.","I think film writing, you're thinking in pictures, and stage writing, you're thinking in dialogue. In film writing, it's also, you only get so many words, so everything has to earn its place in a really economical way. I think for stage writing, you have more leeway.","I grew up in L.A., and I don't think I've seen L.A. onscreen in a way that felt real to me. There are definitely movies, but they are few and far between.","In New York you can just walk out and be among people. You're on the subway among people, you go to cafes, you can talk to people.","I find playwriting really painful. I love it, or I wouldn't do it, but I don't love the theater as much as I love movies.","I love bad movies, whereas going to the theater for me is a painful experience. I think it's really hard to sit and watch actors do something live and have it not go well.","Anytime that I've felt uninspired, I don't force myself to sit down and write. I only do it when I feel the impulse.","I love to walk around New York. Honestly, that's like the best thing, to walk over to Park Slope and go visit my friend Betty and take her dog out in the park or go walk across the Brooklyn Bridge. I really dig being outside and getting to see everybody in the street.","Well, I have a sister that I'm very close with, and that relationship is probably the most intense relationship of my life to date, probably of my life, period.","You set up the story, but the characters start talking, and they go places that you didn't expect. You have to follow.","When I'm writing, I look like a fool because the parts are moving through me and I'm crying and laughing and making faces.","And then the really awful thing is that at the end of the day after crying and experiencing things, then you look at what you've written and you're like, 'Hmm, there's half a page that's good here.' Then you throw out everything else.","People really do make the assumption that I had some weirdo Hollywood upbringing, but my parents are incredibly down-to-earth people who worked really hard to raise us in a way that was health.","If I ever feel that acting is just soul-sucking and I don't want to do it anymore, I could stop.","I find playwriting to be incredibly difficult compared to screenwriting. Part of it is that I grew up watching movies and not watching plays.","But my family's really close and I was interested in what Mommy and Daddy did for a living. So when Mommy and Daddy had a script that wasn't totally age inappropriate, they would let me read it. And we would talk about it.","I read a lot of plays as a kid, but I didn't see that many plays, so I feel better-versed in film history and film structure. I just think it's easier to think in pictures.","I don't have a lot of patience for boring arthouse movies.","If I'm not working, I don't feel complete.","I hate going to bed. I read scripts, clean, listen to the radio - I've fallen asleep to 'This American Life' more times than I can count!","My hero is Michelle Williams, who I grew close to when we did 'Meek's Cutoff.' She's an extraordinary actor and mom.","I'm klutzy, and I don't embarrass easily.","Sometimes I feel that the people I'm writing are more real to me than the people around me. When you take that imaginative leap, you're living so much in that world.","Writing-wise, I like to have a lot of things on the burners at once, because when I hit a wall, I like to move on to the thing I haven't hit a wall on.","I grew up speaking Spanish. The woman who helped raise me was only Spanish-speaking, so it was one of my primary languages as a kid. And I lived in Spain for a while.","You can have a wonderful time doing a movie and believe in it completely, and then you see the final product, and it doesn't look anything like what you thought it was going to.","I almost never write because I want something from my audience. Almost everything I've ever written, I've written because I feel like I have to write this or I'll die. Like, this has to come out of me.","I can work a lot faster when I'm writing a screenplay than when I'm writing a play because, if I'm having a problem with a scene or something, I can just be writing it in a way where there's no dialogue, or find a way to make sound do the work that I want to do or a close-up do the work that I need to do.","Historically, art and music and writing and film have been one of the only tools that is effective against tyranny.","Turning 30 changed me in ways I didn't expect. For the very first time, I felt like my life is valuable. Not my life because I'm putting something good into the world or I'm well-respected in my field, but my life as a human being on this planet for a limited amount of time.","I want to derive pleasure from this planet and put pleasure back into it.","I will be a broken record for justice.","If I didn't find art valuable, I would stop doing my work and only work for justice.","I remember being two, maybe, and hearing my mum's typewriter in the other room and sticking my hands under the door and screaming, 'Mum! Mum!' I was so angry she wouldn't come out. I got used to it quickly.","I do feel like I have the superpower of not caring about my body as an actor.","It was very hard for me to come back to a place of feeling normal about food and about my body. And then, when I came to the other side of it, it felt like something was gone. An exorcism. I still experience the same chemical swings and moods and pain, but I'm much better at dealing with it than I was at 18.","I think a famous parent is really different from a famous grandparent. My parents are very successful, but no one knows who they are, and they live a completely grounded, homey life. I'm friends with the Gummer girls, whose mum is Meryl Streep, and that feels from the outside like a different kind of burden.","I'm a very serious person. Unfortunately, sometimes.","I don't want to do every independent film offered to me.","That moment in 'Broadcast News' where Holly Hunter is told how great it is to be the smartest person in the room, and she cries and says it's awful - I definitely have moments like that sometimes, moments when introspection and drive can be lonely-making. And it doesn't help that I have a partner who is very work-oriented.","There's something really earnest inside me all the time. It's not a cool or fun way to be. Sometimes I would like to experience being someone who's not wired the way I'm wired.","The causes for my eating disorder ran along the usual lines: depression, an inability to express my rage, a desire to exert control, a desire to feel less, a desire to have my body express the things my voice could not. That, and I had gotten in the habit of believing it was better to take up less space.","Every role requires its own set of tools, and I think, because of that, it is very hard to ever feel totally prepared or totally able.","People are always asking me - because of my family - if I ever feel pressure or feel like I have something to live up to. And having that in the back of my head, I've just learned to be really brave even in the face of feeling ill-prepared.","I wasn't raised in a family that cared about how you look. The fact that I have made my living in acting, where that matters, that really feels antithetical to me as a person.","When my first play was produced, I had this sudden feeling that I feel powerful. Like, the next time I go into an audition room, and it's me and the same eight girls as always, I will have this thing that no one can take away from me. They can see us all as interchangeable. But I am not interchangeable.","When 'Ruby Sparks' came out, I had to do so many interviews where I had to explain the film and my politics. And I think there was a willful misunderstanding by some people. They thought the movie was trying to perpetrate the thing the movie was deconstructing.","Maybe this is a way of gaslighting myself, but I think of it this way: In certain circles, my grandpa was considered to be one of the seminal directors of the 20th century. I'm never going to be that. So I might as well do whatever I want."],"Zoe Kravitz":["Beauty is when you can appreciate yourself. When you love yourself, that's when you're most beautiful.","I see the human in everyone and everything. No one is more important than anyone else; I still hang out with my high school friends.","I'm happy to just sit in a cafe and watch people. It's my favorite thing to do, for sure.","I'm a total weirdo and have often felt like an outcast and a freak, and I love that. It makes things so much more exciting.","I am a huge, huge fan of the plain white tee. A good-fitting, vintage plain white t-shirt, like the 'boyfriend shirt', is the sexiest thing a girl can wear. It goes with anything, fancy or casual.","I used to make my grandparents pay a dollar to watch me sing 'Grease' songs and 'Somewhere Over the Rainbow' in their living room. I was always an entertainer, and I would always do all that stuff, but it slowly evolved into a career, which is great, but it wasn't a plan.","I went to a Steiner School, which is very small and nurturing and creative, so I felt like I was in an environment where I could mature. There was less of the clique-y stuff, which can really make high school a living hell for a lot of people, going on, so I was very similar then to who I am now. I'm still a dork.","When I think of my version of a role model, it's not about being the perfect Samaritan; it's just being out there and being honest and happily imperfect.","I don't want to play everyone's best friend. I don't want to play the role of a girl struggling in the ghetto. It's not that that story isn't important, but I saw patterns, and was like, 'I don't relate to these people.'","In high school, I had a really difficult time just loving myself. It's weird; I feel like in the world we live in today, you're not supposed to be like, 'I'm beautiful,' like that's a conceited thing to say.","When I turned 11, my dad decorated a room at the Standard hotel in Los Angeles in a '60s, Austin Powers style. There was human bowling: You run inside a giant inflatable ball and try to knock down pins. To this day, adults say it was one of the craziest parties they've ever been to.","I'm obsessed with Juice Press - they're everywhere. I spend so much money at that place it's crazy.","I'm only at the beginning of my career, but I feel successful in that I haven't sold out in any way, shape or form. I feel good about the choices I've made, and I don't feel like I've let go of any of my values.","I feel like most creative people are total freaks.","I don't wear a lot of perfumey-perfumes because I think a lot of them smell like you're wearing perfume. And I don't want to smell like that.","Fame has become this obsession for people, which kind of creeps me out.","I stream this radio station, Radio Nova, that's based in Paris. They curate a beautiful set that's really all over the place - they'll play blues or some West African music, then A Tribe Called Quest, then funk from Ethiopia, then James Brown, and then the Beatles. It's an amazing mix.","That's definitely something I've experienced my whole life - people thinking one thing and then discovering that I'm not, hopefully. So I relate to having to fight that and claim my own identity, when people are trying to throw different ones at me.","I learned early on - I can go to a shoot, and they will put anything they want to put on me, and I'll look like an idiot because I didn't say I don't like it. It's OK to have an opinion.","I get so nervous before I go onstage - beyond butterflies!","I would fly to Los Angeles just for a cheeseburger with pickles and extra tomatoes from In-N-Out.","Turquoise is my birthstone; I'm a Sagittarius.","My dad dated a lot of supermodels.","My mother's a... beautiful woman, and I think, in some way, I felt intimidated by that sometimes.","When I have trouble sleeping, I'll read, watch old episodes of 'Sex and the City,' or dance around my house. Music helps me wind down.","I was raised vegan. My mom would always make quinoa with squash and kale, hippie stuff like that. Now I eat meat, but I try to be conscious about where it's coming from.","My dad has totally taken my Cat Stevens T-shirt, but it's OK; I have his Black Flag one, and that's amazing.","I've found all of my apartments on Craigslist. I've got good Craigslist luck. I just sit on my couch and really focus on it, and I've gotten really lucky that way.","The kinds of things I like with crystals are the really beautiful costume jewelry, vintage pieces, and they usually have that diamond shape.","My style is very inspired by both my parents, so we all have the same taste.","I love London; I could totally live here, actually. I'm in New York most of the time, and it really reminds me a lot of New York.","I live in Brooklyn, in Williamsburg, so I just like to wander around. Williamsburg's such a cool little neighborhood community spot.","The '60s is one of my favourite eras in general. I love '60s music, and I've always wanted to do a period film.","People love teen movies because everyone can relate.","I'm a New Yorker; I've paid my dues.","I like to make music because it's fun to do and it makes me feel good, but I have no desire to be a huge pop singer or anything like that. I just like to make it.","I'd love to do a comedy; that's the one thing I haven't done yet that I really, really want to do.","I think it's always very important to be comfortable and just kind of expressive; if you take fashion too seriously, then you lose the fun of it. I think you should always take the risk.","I love shopping in New York just because you walk around and find a little store you've never saw before, and you're like, 'Oh what's that? This is my new favorite place.' I love that about New York.","Acting and making art is just something I love to do, and I love to tell stories that feel important, honest and necessary.","Sometimes it's less about the character and more about the story for me. I'll play a rock in the background if I think the story is fantastic and I can be a part of it somehow. That's what I look for.","I'm not a very organized person.","I don't really go out, 'go out' that much anymore. I live in Brooklyn, in Williamsburg, so I just like to wander around. Williamsburg's such a cool little neighborhood community spot.","I think I'm lucky having parents that have been in show business for a while, and they don't care about the shiny stuff so much. They raised me in that way - to stay grounded, not to chase the shiny, pretty things.","From middle school to the first year of high school, I went to a school in Miami that seemed like a private country club. The whole cheerleader, football player, clique-y thing there was terrifying. Those people were so scary. They're the scariest kinds of people because they are idolized by their peers.","I'm pretty much a thrift shop gal. Flea markets on Sundays.","I do focus my energy on music, but it's just the way that the industry works. I kind of have to take what I can get when it comes to acting and show up so they'll hire me. And music I get to do when I have time. It's not that I focus less, it's just the way it works.","I try not to wear foundation unless I have a giant pimple, which sometimes I do. For the red carpet, I may add a brighter colored lip and darker eyes. But my standard is blush and mascara.","The whole Hollywood thing where people want to put me into this 'quirky-fashionista, daughter of' category makes me mad because it's promoting something that I don't believe in, and it's not who I am.","Hollywood is like a really sad, grown up version of high school where people get labeled as 'cool,' 'not cool,' 'jock,' 'bombshell,' 'quirky'... it's like a caste system. You're either in, or you're out.","I look back on some of my outfits, and I'm like: 'Why did I wear that? Where are my friends and why didn't they tell me not to leave the house?' If they had, I probably would've said, 'You don't know what you're talking about. This looks amazing.'","I'm a big fan of, like, wearing old, vintage slips and stuff as outdoor wear. I got, like, a pair of these little silk bloomers. I think they were even, like, considered underwear in the '40s. I wore them as shorts the other day.","I don't really have a beauty routine. I always use coconut oil, and I always wear mascara. That's kind of it! I'm pretty simple.","One of my favorite movies of all time is 'Bugsy Malone.'","I had a really hard time when I was 16, 17, 18. I started with the eating disorder in high school.","You can tell when someone is driven by labels. If something is couture, they think it's important and wear it and sometimes make a terrible fashion mistake. People are shocked that I know so little about designers.","It's superficial that people think I'm cool because I wear certain clothes and I have tattoos. The funniest part is, when they get to know me, they're always surprised by how nerdy I am.","My mom and grandmother were actresses, and I knew I was going to do this since I was super young. I would put on shows at my grandparents' house and sing 'Somewhere Over the Rainbow' in the living room. I was in drama club and chorus, and I knew every word to 'Grease.'","There are a bunch of images that are thrown in our faces all the time about what we're supposed to look like at 14, 15, 16. It's confusing. I think every woman can identify with that struggle.","In the last 'Batman' movie, they told me that I couldn't get an audition for a small role they were casting because they weren't 'going urban.' It was like, 'What does that have to do with anything?'","The one thing about art is you can't question it. Everyone is looking at everyone else to find out what's cool. No one knows what's cool.","I like to wear shoes that are cool but also practical. The same goes for bags. Your bag is a big deal in New York. You can't just carry around a little clutch, because you don't have a car or anywhere to stash things during the day, so you need to carry your whole life with you. That's why I like big, chunky bags with lots of compartments.","I think both of my parents are unique in the way they don't live their lives as celebrities. They're both artists, first and foremost. My mom lives a very private life. So does my father. You don't really see them in the tabloids or anything like that. I think that's definitely a decision you can make.","I've stayed away from doing 'urban film' because I just don't relate to the characters. I'm not going to take a role because I happen to have the same skin color.","For me, whenever I would see a lot of 'black films,' I didn't feel represented in it. I didn't feel connected to the characters or the situations or the humor.","I identified with white culture, and I wanted to fit in. I didn't identify with black culture. Like, I didn't like Tyler Perry movies, and I wasn't into hip-hop music. I liked Neil Young."],"Zoe Lister-Jones":["In most movies there is a Prince Charming who rides up and saves the girl.","I love a good massage, and they gotta go deep.","Nobody's life is wrapped up neatly in a bow.","The secret to a long-lasting relationship is perpetually imagining the worst. It's a world view tracing back to my Eastern European ancestry and one I draw upon regularly.","I think a lot of people, especially women, feel like to be whole, you need to find part of yourself in another person - probably because of the fables we're told as kids.","There's a lot of people desperately seeking to find 'the one,' and I think we should learn to be more at peace with ourselves.","I think women are really self-analytical in a way that men aren't.","See, I will always shop, and that's sort of a problem. Clothes are always exploding out of my closet!","I think growing up in New York, you see so much at such a young age, there's no bubble to escape into.","I think all our characters are an amalgam of people we know in our world and ourselves.","Most actors and actresses are performative as people.","I guess actors are very sensitive people. We're porous.","I've always been a writer, and in high school, I was the editor of my school newspaper and I got a writing scholarship. It's always been a passion of mine.","I have a hard time waiting for things to happen.","There's no shame in owning a New Kids on the Block t-shirt. They were my first concert when I was eight.","We are very puritan in America. We still hold true to these really antiquated values, this idea of the sanctity of marriage.","It's human nature to want to be with other people.","I'm a big lipstick girl - I'm old school that way.","I spent my teens and early 20s shopping almost exclusively at thrift stores.","I'm a health-food junkie, so all of my food is a splurge, money-wise!","In my view, relationship movies never get old because humanity will never not be confounded by their relationships.","I think 'Girls' is pretty brilliant.","I love 'Husbands and Wives,' Woody Allen's movie. It's like one of my all-time favorites. I could watch it over and over again.","Most single women have been in that situation where there is a silent guy in your group. You don't see him as boyfriend material. He's just there, but you know all the same people.","Being a single woman is like going off to war.","Women always try to see the one good part of The Weird Guy because the dating landscape is so bleak. Women will say, 'He's very odd, but he likes to cook. He's creepy, but he makes good pancakes!'","For any couple, once you delve into the idea of non-monogamy, you're entering pretty frightening territory.","My parents have always been very open."],"Zoe Lofgren":["What makes America special is that people come here, assimilate and become American with all of the rights and responsibilities citizenship bestows.","Social Security not only helps Americans enjoy a secure retirement, it has also kept millions of Americans out of poverty.","I think there needs to be a way to allow people to become educated if they've paid taxes, they've been here a long time. And I think, actually, we need to think about young people are not making the decision on whether to come here.","The Administration has made critical mistakes and errors in judgment leading up to the war in Iraq. The President refuses to acknowledge these mistakes, and thus, no corrective action has been taken to prevent these problems from happening again.","I think the motive is to establish in federal law the personhood from conception forward and try and alter the Constitution through statute.","We can only undo the election if the behavior meets the constitutional standard of subverting and threatening our system of government."],"Zoe McLellan":["I lived in New York City for a while and miss it like it's a person. Although I grew up in the Pacific Northwest, I'm a New Yorker at heart. A stroll through Central Park, a visit to the MET, a show on Broadway. There is no other city like it in the world!","I'm a big fan of a great glass of red wine and a delicious bowl of pasta made from scratch.","When I travel, there are no rules with my diet. I eat whatever looks good, but in small portions. Food is such a rich part of the travel experience. There is no way I would cut that out!","As a child, we visited the San Juan Islands during the summer. Kayaking, big family meals, playing on the beach - great memories!","Growing up in Seattle, I had the opportunity to take classes since I was 7 years old. I did theatre. I auditioned for film, television, commercials, and built up not just a resume but also some confidence. I learned how to master my craft before arriving in Los Angeles.","I remember my very first audition for a film. I was in Seattle. They were taping the session, and I just went crazy. The director finally said, 'Zoe, what are you doing? The camera's right here. Just talk to me.' And it took that director saying that to me to change everything.","I came to L.A. with confidence in my craft, and I was very offended when I didn't get a part. It took me awhile to understand that it is not always about your acting.","One of the most precious parts of acting is the work before you show up on the set, the time you spend being with your character before you bring that character to life. To me, that's the most rewarding part of it all. It feels very good to show up on a set just knowing that's with you.","I loved 'Dirty Sexy Money.' That didn't have a long enough shelf life. I would've liked to explore that character and play with that cast longer. That was a lot of fun to shoot.","I want to do a romantic comedy. Like a 'When Harry Met Sally' romantic comedy... A really sweet, show-my-vulnerability kind of role.","We can quiet our minds enough to tune in to what our bodies are telling us - I believe in angels - and we need to listen to the messages being sent. They are real messages - just as real as a human saying something to you.","I'm a big fan of Katy Perry.","I dream in numbers, and I like to look up the meaning of numbers, and numbers stick out to me.","I don't necessarily call myself a psychic, but since I was a little girl, I would dream about things, and then I would tell my dad, and it would happen the next day.","First acting gig was playing a victim in 'America's Most Wanted.' The night the show aired, they caught the killer!"],"Zoe Saldana":["Glamour is about feeling good in your own skin.","Happiness is nothing but temporary moments here and there - and I love those. But I would be bored out of my mind if I were happy all the time.","People think of Latina women as being fiery and fierce, which is usually true. But I think the quality that so many Latinas possess is strength. I'm very proud to have Latin blood.","I'm very accepting with my age. It's like notches on your belt: experience, wisdom, and a different kind of beauty. There comes a day when you've become comfortable in your skin.","I'm learning the power of going away for the weekend and keeping myself company.","It takes a lot of courage to face up to things you can't do because we feed ourselves so much denial.","Our censorship has sort of gotten a little too far. Too much censorship is just as bad as having none at all. Children need to be exposed to things, because if they don't see it, eventually, it's not like it's not going to happen, but it's just that there needs to be a balance.","I'm more of a guy's girl. I like having a beer in a bar, and I don't bicker or sit down and do my nails.","There's nobody on this earth who can tell you that what you're feeling is wrong. They can tell you it's different to what they're feeling.","I just want to be a part of great stories, whether I'm part of an amazing ensemble cast or I'm leading it or the antagonist or whatever.","I want to be the best daughter, sister, friend and wife I can possibly be - because when I die, I am not going to be buried with my Oscar.","I'm a very feminine person, but I have this hard shell, man, and I stay focused and don't take things personally.","Growing up, my dolls were doctors and on secret missions. I had Barbie Goes Rambo.","I'm Latin - we start young, honey!","I don't understand labels. I don't need anybody to tell me I'm Latina or black or anything else. I've played characters that were written for Caucasian females, I just want to be given the same consideration as everybody else, and so far that has been happening.","Call me crazy - I love elk meat!","I have a hyper personality.","I'm so intrigued by women throughout history where the significance of what they were representing at that time is obscured by the fact a man saved them or they were prostitutes.","I want to love life.","Basically, there's not enough sex in movies, that's it. I'm trying to say it, people. I miss sex in movies because sex is natural, guns are not.","I don't like things like little sandals that look fragile. I like to look strong and commanding.","There comes a day when you've become comfortable in your skin. But God as my witness, I am going to try to do everything I can to keep this ass together for as long as I possibly can - without going against nature.","It gets pretty boring when all you are is the support system for a male character.","I want to be in the small percentage of women who don't settle for conventional roles.","I had to quit ballet because it felt like a part of me was dying inside.","In dance you use every party of your body except your voice. I wanted to start acting because I wanted to use my voice.","As a woman, you spend so much time either cooking or getting ready to go somewhere. I like to have music when I'm doing either of these things.","Music is a very big participant in everything I do, from the moment I wake up to the moment I go to bed.","If there's anything that I've always said about myself is that to me, it's much more important for me to get to work with filmmakers that I've grown up loving and admiring.","I just want to be part of great stories that are told and for them to be relevant.","Physical roles give me a chance to learn something new.","I'm a girl from Queens. I've never gone, 'What am I doing today? Oh, I'm gonna grab a gun and learn how to use it.'","I know the responsibility that entails from telling a story. The one thing I despise the most is when I go to a movie and I see a whole bunch of lazy actors making me waste my time and money.","I love the anxiety, the pressure of the loud room full of yapping kids. But I'm a kid myself.","I get along very well with animals and children. I dig them, I get them.","A child speaks more sense than an adult half of the time.","What doesn't feel okay to me, what feels a little bit out of balance, is when you want to turn yourself into something else - when you want to be another person.","Every time an adult is going to write something for a teenager and you don't have, physically, a person who is that, you are always going to be a little off.","Dancing for the length of time that I did, it centered me in such a way to be really in tune with my body, and I just feel like I'm physically able to do things because of my ballet background. Without ballet, I don't think I'd look graceful at all on screen.","The biggest battle that I have is being a woman in the world. That takes center stage for me.","I'm a sci-fi girl. If I can have anything in life, I'd want tons of great science-fiction movies and stories. It's so progressive, beautiful, and imaginative.","I like to look strong and commanding.","I love wearing men's clothing and underwear.","When I act, a part of me goes into the character I am playing.","I am hoping for a long career.","I don't believe actors who say they don't bleed into their characters. It's absolutely impossible not to.","I am fluent in Spanish and I understand French, Italian and Portuguese.","I think as an American society, when we're paying too many taxes or dealing with war, we don't want to see sad things at the movies.","Our brains are very animal but also very strange and egotistical. We're narcissistic.","Every character has their reasons - even the characters who do dumb things.","There are a lot of magazines that are still sort of... that only cater to a certain demographic and only put certain people on their covers.","I never like to get political, but when you have the ability, through your media, to influence a large mass of people, I would want to be a part of the evolving cycle of progress vs. keeping things the way that they are.","To be seen and to be respected for my work and acknowledged as a true American Latina... means a lot to me.","I love aging. Why would I want to be 21 for the rest of my life?"],"Zoe Sugg":["A girl can never have too many lipstick options!","As cheesy as it sounds, nothing beats a smile and a bit of confidence! As long as you feel good on the inside, you can still look beautiful without any makeup at all.","Sharing is the essence of social media.","When life catches up with us, we all need space to dream and indulge, so I have created my own special range of bath & beauty loveliness to help you find your happy place.","It's good for me to do things outside my comfort zone and push myself.","It's so hard not to smile.","I know that I do have influence over the people who watch me, and it's quite a pressure. I have to stay positive, and while I would never use the words 'role model', I am mindful of the responsibilities that come with a substantial viewership.","For the doubters out there, of course I was going to have help from Penguin's editorial team in telling my story, which I talked about from the beginning.","It's always nice to have more than just two hands if you're making cakes.","Nine per cent of my viewers are men, of which the majority is, I think, 45 to 50. I like to tell myself it's just my dad watching.","There isn't any amount of money that could tempt me to promote something that I didn't believe in.","Who knows what will happen in five years' time.","I'm so grateful to everyone who has bought a copy of 'Girl Online.' I love that so many of my viewers are enjoying the book!","After I left school, where I studied art, photography and textiles at A-level, I started doing an apprenticeship in interior design, but I wasn't really enjoying it very much, so I decided to do something creative, and in 2009, I began blogging.","I have an incredibly high metabolism.","People say they like my fashion-haul videos because it's like you've been shopping with your friends, and you look back over what you have bought.","I'm a total people pleaser.","I could never let the teacher down. I always worked hard, too scared to get in trouble.","I know just how isolating it can feel to experience severe anxiety.","Everyone needs help when they try something new.","The story and the characters of 'Girl Online' are mine.","'Bake Off' is one of my favourite programmes, so I was genuinely a little bit shocked and very excited when I was asked to take part.","There are times I turn off my Wi-Fi, and I'm selective about what I want to share with the world now.","I don't know, the word 'famous' just sounds really weird to me, because I'm just me.","When I got a million subscribers, it just sort of snowballed from there because a lot more people show interest. They're like, 'Who's this? They've got a million subscribers; maybe I'll like their channel.'","I don't really know how to work a camera.","I do have some viewers who know where I live, and they'll stand outside.","People follow me because I am just a normal person, and they can relate to me.","If you're having fun being yourself and filming something that you would watch yourself, it becomes contagious for other people to watch, too.","As a 14-year-old with anxiety, to have read about that in a book would have helped me so much.","I think I need security.","I don't like standing and talking in front of lots of people.","I'm not the biggest Miley Cyrus fan. I'm not the risque type.","My life is not perfect.","I still love my little home on YouTube, really.","I think a lot more people are starting to understand the power of YouTube.","When you're younger, you worry about so many things that you don't need to worry about, like image, appearance.","Sometimes I feel it would be nice to have a bit more privacy.","I get notes posted on my windscreen wipers and through my letterbox.","I'll post a video, and it might get 10,000 comments, and I'll scroll through and they'll all be lovely and nice - but then they'll be one saying, 'I hate you; I'm unsubscribing' and that's the one that sticks out and stays on your mind all day.","I'd always loved watching YouTube videos, and that's what inspired me to make them myself. Initially I was drawn to makeup tutorials - I learned everything I know about makeup from YouTube.","I'm not as tech savvy as some YouTubers, but I'm a lot better than my grandparents. Whenever I have a technical question, or something isn't working, I ask Google, and that usually throws up the answer.","The joy of YouTube is that you can create content about anything you feel passionate about, however silly the subject matter.","People send me fanmail in the post, and I keep every letter, and I always say I will read every single one. It might take me years and years, but I'll do it. Your audience are what makes you, so you have give as much back as you can.","Since I could read, I always had my nose in a book.","I love watching other beauty girls on YouTube, so I get a lot of ideas through their videos. I also get plenty of requests from viewers, which is great. I can never run out of ideas!","I love to do a messy top knot because it's so easy but looks like it could have taken a bit of effort!"],"Zoe Tapper":["I honestly wondered how on earth I would manage to combine work and motherhood.","The best piece of advice that my mother gave me is to never have a plan B. She told me to stick to plan A because if you have a plan B you will inevitably fall back on it.","I fell in love with acting at around the age of 11, when I was drafted in to play a fairy at an amateur production of 'Midsummer Night's Dream.'","Throughout school I appeared in all sorts of productions and deep in my heart of hearts I knew that was what I want to do more than anything else.","As an impoverished student I used to spend days out in Selfridges, nibbling on samples of free cheese and dousing myself with scent in the perfume department.","'Mr Selfridge' is a lot more accessible than shows like 'Downton.' Everyone knows the store, but not everyone knows the story. Having this store as the backdrop with all of society working under one roof, I think it really captures people's imaginations.","I hadn't actually watched 'Entourage.' But I do understand that if you know and love that show, Jeremy Piven is about as good as it gets.","I love Kate Winslet, Rachel Weisz, Maggie Smith and Judi Dench as well. They're all wonderful and they're very inspiring."],"Zoe Wanamaker":["Shakespeare's taught me that there are more words in the English language than I have got in my head.","I don't have the confidence to be a personality.","I don't have any regrets about not having had children. What's the point? It's just something else to beat yourself up over.","I don't want to be a director, or to have responsibility for hundreds of people.","My mother was adorable, a great giggler. My father was very strong and could be quite frightening.","My father's death from prostate cancer in 1993 was tragic. He never complained about pain. He was a fighter. By the time he was ready to die he wasn't able to die in the way that he wanted to, which seemed an outrage to me.","I have lots of passions - gardens, art, music and reading. I have eclectic taste and read a huge variety of books.","I absolutely hate clothes shopping, though I love clothes. It's my idea of heaven to be handed things to wear.","I'm constantly intimidated by Shakespeare's work. Trying to decipher what he's saying and holding on to that thought - not just as an actor, but as a human being - is a rigour.","Shakespeare showed me that once I understand the rules, I can break them.","'As You Like It' was the first Shakespeare production I ever did."],"Zoey Deutch":["My parents were reluctant to let me start auditioning until I was at least a little bit emotionally stable - I'm still working on that! And so I started when I was fifteen, and it was the best thing that could have happened to me in terms of being able to focus my crazy teenage energy into something good.","It's nice to have my mother as someone I can talk to about acting. My dad's a director, so when he comes to watch me on set, he think it's his set. He's always telling a production assistant, 'Can you get me five donuts?'","My mom passed on her obsession of all things antique or vintage. I love to go thrift store shopping or explore any sort of garage sale. Treasure hunting is a family passion.","Bullies generally were bullied and are hurting inside much more than you could ever imagine.","One thing my family has shown me is that having a sense of humor is everything.","I find humor to be the most attractive characteristic, but I certainly won't cancel anything out, considering when you love someone you love someone, and sometimes you just can't explain it.","You see, every day, that the people who are seemingly so confident and seemingly so in love with themselves are the ones who are the most insecure and hurting the most inside.","In high school, I tried very hard to make everybody like me, which resulted in me being extremely unhappy and in a lot of pain. Therefore, the lesson I got from that was that I can't make everybody happy.","I'm not a writer. I'm not smart. I couldn't possibly even write my own story.","My parents are supportive of anything I want to do, as long as it's not bad.","I feel naked without my rings, and don't like walking out of the house without them, even if they do tear half of my sweaters and stab my friends in the eye.","I'm pretty terrible at writing, so the way I kind of therapeutically get through things is by drawing.","I think people know that I love food, but maybe people don't know that I cook a lot.","I am a very, very avid 'Anchorman' fan.","I'm such a fan of Shailene Woodley, so I'm super excited to see all her stuff. She's an awesome actress.","I'm being hypocritical because I have a Twitter, but I try to not talk about things like, 'Oh, I had a grapefruit this morning and it was delicious,' because, who cares?","I get really nervous when people are like, 'I saw you in a trailer! I saw you on TV!' Genuinely, my cheeks get red.","I think being able to really fall in love with someone is the craziest thing that could ever happen. You know, allowing yourself to really go there and really feel those things is extremely scary.","I'm always, all the time, eating chocolate. I eat pretty healthy, but then I go all out when it has to do with chocolate.","I've always wanted to be an actress as well as a fashion designer.","I'm a total hip-hop geek. That's my favorite kind of music to listen to while getting ready.","I never thought I would become that person who loves working out. It sucks while you're doing it, but the second you finish, it's like, 'Wow, I feel great! I'm stronger and much more confident.'","I'm not going to give up salt and sugar because I want to look like Adriana Lima. But I am going to work out to make myself feel good in my own body.","My signature look is an eighties baby doll dress, combat boots with colorful socks sticking out, and then mounds of jewelry. I love silver and turquoise. I go to Montana every winter, so I hunt around for cool pieces there.","My sister, mom and I all wear the same size, so I shop a lot at a boutique called 'my mother's closet' that is right down the hall from my bedroom. She has vintage Comme des Garcons dresses that I feel so elegant wearing.","Borderline embarrassing fact: I used to have a pseudo line when I was seven called Zizzy Fashion. I love clothing, and I would eventually like to design as well as act."],"Zoketsu Norman Fischer":["There may be a long list of things to do, but really, there is just one thing on the list at any time. If you think of it like that, the whole world looks different and you can stay quite calm. Maybe everything will get done eventually and maybe not. You can always have hope.","Whether you are a genius or an idiot, a thief or, like me, a Zen priest who has cultivated the mind for 30 years - the mind anyway is subject to conditions."],"Zola Budd":["I will never regret not denouncing apartheid.","Coming from a farming background, I saw nothing out of the ordinary in running barefoot, although it seemed to startle the rest of the athletics world. I have always enjoyed going barefoot and when I was growing up I seldom wore shoes, even when I went into town.","I can drink tea until the cows come home and I love the atmosphere in tea-shops.","I found them uncomfortable and after that I decided to continue running barefoot because I found it more comfortable. I felt more in touch with what was happening - I could actually feel the track.","I have strong views about South African politics and I still don't feel I need to make public statements.","I no longer run barefoot.","Looking back... it's hard to understand what all the fuss was about as things changed in just a few years. When you look at all the things that have happened in the world, it seems very small.","Tea-shops were to become my favourite haunts in England."],"Zola Jesus":["Everything I do is a reflection of the duality within me. Musically, I really love things that are very synthetic and unnatural. And I also like the organic and human... the intrinsic, I guess.","It sounds kind of stupid, but I've never not wanted to be a musician. It's been inside me since I was little so I don't know what else I would do.","No matter what you do, if there's something you're afraid of, you need to break through it.","And my music is always such a release of what I feel inside, an impulse.","I try to create songs that are really massive and intense, but at the same time remaining honest and raw.","I started performing opera when I was 10 years old. I didn't perform as Zola Jesus until I was probably 18.","The greatest benefit of being a solo performer is that it is seriously frightening, but at the same time very empowering. It's just you and the audience. All the weight is on you to deliver the songs.","I guess something people wouldn't expect me to listen to are artists like Alicia Keys. But she is so incredibly talented. She has this huge voice and great work ethic, which I really respect in an artist. She is also very humble and gracious and devoted to her skill.","My music started as a way to break through weaknesses - like anxiety, which was completely taking over my whole life, where I could barely function.","When you fall in love, you become weak.","The only reason I would write a break-up song is because my own problem of allowing myself to relate to people.","I think I'm making music that's pretty universal.","I don't know why people think I'm a Goth - that's a misconception.","People don't really understand who I am. They always think that I'm very dark or depressed, but it couldn't be further from the truth!","As a child, I was always making sound; it was a compulsion. I loved to scream and yell and sing; it freed me from all the thoughts in my head. I begged for opera lessons because opera singing is the most formidable, most emotional way to use your voice.","True expression is hard when performing opera. The problem is that opera relies on the dramatic context of the piece. It can be interpreted and represented, but there are guidelines; there is a vocabulary within the pieces that you must know objectively and reflect.","I don't find much influence in opera. It was such a different part of me.","The word 'theatrical' makes me cringe, because it suggests a performance is staged, put on, rehearsed. And while all this is true for an opera, I believe the act of singing and performing should always be honest, raw, guttural."],"Zoltan Kodaly":["Real art is one of the most powerful forces in the rise of mankind, and he who renders it accessible to as many people as possible is a benefactor of humanity.","To teach a child an instrument without first giving him preparatory training and without developing singing, reading and dictating to the highest level along with the playing is to build upon sand.","Let us take our children seriously! Everything else follows from this... only the best is good enough for a child.","Singing connected with movements and action is a much more ancient, and, at the same time, more complex phenomenon than is a simple song.","I would advise my young colleagues, the composers of symphonies, to drop in sometimes at the kindergarten, too. It is there that it is decided whether there will be anybody to understand their works in twenty years' time.","The laws of morals and the laws of music are the same.","We should read music in the same way that an educated adult will read a book: in silence, but imagining the sound."],"Zong Qinghou":["Many people find themselves with illness as they become successful: higher blood pressure and diabetes.","People who get rich early should help the rest get rich.","We don't need to solve the problem of the rich-poor gap. We need to solve the problem of common prosperity.","When you are poor, you'll have to think of ways to be better off.","For a long time, I couldn't even afford food and clothing. I climbed from the very bottom of the society.","I believe wealth should be in the hands of those who know how to create more wealth.","The U.S. and European markets have become mature, profit margins are lower, and equipment isn't so new. Because profits are relatively low, it limits the willingness of companies to invest in newer equipment.","We are working to understand the tastes of people born in the 1980s and 1990s - it is very different from my generation. We do our own research. Marketing research companies, I think, are relatively academic.","In China, you have to have a strong leader for a business to get anything done.","If the nation is rich but people are poor, the country cannot be strong, and society will be unstable."],"Zooey Deschanel":["Summer has always been my favorite season. I feel happier.","Nothing's better than a picnic.","I'm a person who gets better with practice. Getting older is awesome - because you get more practice.","I'm always doing something musically - when I'm working or when I'm off.","I'm a person who has a lot of energy. So, yes, I don't really stop to rest or de-stress. I just keep going. I figure that if you don't stop, then you'll never notice how tired you are.","Nothing could be as hard as middle school.","I hate camping, but I love summer camp.","I think that if you haven't been to the grocery store in a really long time, it's really easy to get very out of touch.","I'm a very positive person. I get excited easily, and I like to jump around.","I like to play the ukulele, but I'm not, like, awesome at it. I mostly play the piano and the guitar.","I always wanted to be normal. I tried really hard, but it's like I try so hard and then people still say I'm offbeat. I've learnt to accept that and take advantage of it as an actor.","I grew up believing my sister was from the planet Neptune and had been sent down to Earth to kill me.","True love that lasts forever... yes, I do believe in it. My parents have been married for 40 years and my grandparents were married for 70 years. I come from a long line of true loves.","I accidentally entered a youth pageant when I was 14. That's like a beauty pageant, but without the beauty. It was terrible.","If I'm going to be 'too' anything, 'too cute' is fine. I love puppies. So what? Who hates puppies?","A lot of people work out to be skinny. That's so boring, and it seems like a depressing goal for a modern woman.","I don't know why femininity should be associated with weakness. Women should be free to express who they are without thinking, 'I need to act like a man, or I need to tone it down to be successful.' That's a very good way to keep women down.","The Internet's like one big bathroom wall with a lot of people who anonymously can say really mean things. It's fine, I believe in freedom of speech and I think people should think what they want, but I don't care to hear it.","I'm into sincerity in music and sincerity in art. If it doesn't feel true, I don't want to do it. Things that are too dramatic scare me. I think that's why I don't always fit into the world of performing arts.","I feel like songwriting is an experiment in empathy.","I have been a harmony enthusiast since I was a child, singing in choir and with friends growing up. I always put a ton of harmonies on my demos.","I grew up believing my sister was from the planet Neptune and had been sent down to Earth to kill me. I believed this because my sister Emily convinced me of it when I was a toddler. I think she'd seen Invasion of the Body Snatchers and her imagination ran away with her. There's a part of me that still believes it.","I like old movies, screwball comedies, vintage clothes, and basically I'm an old-fashioned gal.","I did not have a date to the prom. I went to my junior prom alone, and my senior prom, I was doing my first movie. I went in a limousine with, like, a bunch of people to my junior prom. It was a group date.","I find sadness and strife to be so much more interesting with an upbeat melody.","I like having a schedule. I tend to be the type of person that thrives on something being regular.","There's something about guitars, they're just so big, you know what I mean? You're just like, 'Ugh!' It just seems so overwhelming. And the ukulele is, like, the opposite of overwhelming.","Certain aspects of my personality are always going to come out on-screen. I guess that's just me - if they say I'm quirky, I'm quirky. It's better than being boring.","I love singing Christmas carols. I know every harmony to every music-hall Christmas song.","I gravitate towards happy music. I love the Beach Boys.","I'm the worst at picking what movies are going to do well. I have no idea. I'm really surprised if a movie I like does well.","If I'm trying to please every craze fan, then I can't. Of course, we all want to please the fans.","I love having a lot of content. I prefer to have constant stimulation.","If I were to work with my mom, I probably would not want her to play my mom. That would get too real.","I've always straddled a weird line - there's a lot of mainstream stuff that I love. At the same, I still feel like an outsider. I'm the outsider who's on the inside.","Anyone who knows me knows that I am really into hair. I'm a real girly girl and love doing my hair and experimenting with different styles.","My nursery school did a production of 'The Three Little Pigs.' I played the third pig. When the wolf knocked on my door, I refused to get up and answer it because, to me, he was knocking the wrong way. I just lay there, snoring away on stage, fully immersed in my character. My dad turned to my mom and said: 'Dustin Hoffman.'","If people just want to be famous, that's just not enough to get you up at 4 in the morning to go to work. You have to love what you're doing.","To be a gluten-free vegan is, like, the most difficult thing you can possibly be.","Making movies, you're like an independent contractor - you come in, you have a specific job, and a lot of what you do is completely manipulated, which is good and bad.","My sister was always very motherly, babysitting and stuff.","Always the aim for me is making people feel like they are not alone. That's just the greatest feeling.","I started out doing musicals.","For me, writing is 75 percent procrastinating and 25 percent actually sitting down and working.","I just sort of follow my bliss, so to speak, and then I see where that takes me.","No, I've been singing forever. I started out doing musicals. I think that was part of the reason why they gave me the part, because I sang.","It's nice that there are movies and songs about romance - it's what motivates us as human beings. I'm all for being brainwashed by rom-coms.","I think I'm a fun flatmate. I'm always cheerful. I go on tour with my band so it's 12 people on one bus and I feel like I'm the one who's happy in the morning. I'm not a chaotic person, but I might slack off on doing the dishes from time to time.","I can't even remember the first time I started singing.","You can't expect to make no effort. You still have to make the effort and be kind and understanding.","I always choose roles that are, you know, hopefully different from the last role. I don't wanna do the same thing over and over again because that's, well, first of all that's no fun.","It's a lot harder to do an ensemble because your energy is going in so many different places, and you have to cover everybody. You have to sort of split your attention.","I don't have control over what's on screen, and that's terrifying.","I like singing as much as I like acting, and all through high school I thought I might be a Broadway singer.","I'm always trying to do stuff I haven't done before or challenge myself so I'm not resting on my laurels all of the time because if I just found my little niche and never left it, I'd be pretty boring, I think.","It's an addiction. I love clothes. I like to go down Melrose and look in all the windows and I go to different flea markets. I have lots of costumes. You never know when you're going to have to dress up like a milkmaid from the 1600s.","I wasn't really the most charming person, socially - it took me a long time to develop my people skills - but the one place I was always comfortable was onstage, acting or singing.","I think my knowledge of music theory is rooted in jazz theory, and a lot of the writers of standards - Rodgers and Hart, and Gershwin.","I love downtown L.A .and I relish any opportunity to spend time there.","I think it's better to have your personal life and your work life separate. That way they don't corrupt each other, so to speak.","I love to cook. But I have some food allergies, so I have to contend with those.","I wish I got invited to more luaus. I really do!","I get really insecure because even though I can speak in musician's terms, I don't know as much as real musicians.","I think there's a certain space people have decided I occupy - the funny-sidekick thing.","Especially in comedies, I think a lot of time the female characters are there to provide a balance for guys.","My biggest complaint with tights is that they do not accommodate skinny-ankled people like myself.","I will wear tights even if it's 100 degrees outside. Tights are my safety blanket.","I sort of consider myself a comedic actress, not a comedienne. I think it's different. You know, I'm not a stand-up or anything, but playing into comedic situations is sort of where, I think, my strength lies.","I really like the collaboration of doing movies and television. But I like the sort of solitary work of doing music.","In my mind, I always think of myself as an underdog type.","From my perspective, probably women are won over by people who are sweet and respectful and courteous and kind and funny. I think those are the things that win women over.","I think that the mistakes that anyone can make going on dates is probably not being themselves because you can only trick people for so long.","I like romantic comedy as a genre, but I think it can get stuck in its ways.","I went to Northwestern because I had gone to a really nontraditional high school. I was like, 'It'd be cool to have a traditional college experience.' Then I was like, 'Oh, but none of these people understand what's cool about me. My specialness is not appreciated in this place.'","'It Girl' is supposed to be something that only lasts a certain amount of time. They keep calling me an 'It Girl,' and at this point it makes me laugh, because I've done that so many times: 'You're it;' 'You're not it.' What is 'it?'","I have Pro Tools on my computer, and I make CDs all the time.","People sometimes say, 'Oh, you were a movie star,' and I'm like, 'No, I was a supporting actress.' I wasn't an A-list actress, and I'm fine with that. I'm proud of what I did in film.","If 'New Girl' had been a movie, I don't know whether I would have been given the opportunity to do it.","I think making a movie or a record, the best things happen by accident - and those end up being the magic. Every time I've followed my gut it's been better than when I've tried to do what I was supposed to do.","Women I admired growing up - Debra Winger, Diane Keaton, Meryl Streep - were all beautiful and thin, but not too thin. There are a lot of actresses who are unhealthy-skinny - much, much too skinny. You can't Pilates to that.","I have had brown hair and bangs since I was 2. One year I dyed it blonde, which felt so weird.","'Pastoralia' by George Saunders is one of my favorite novels.","I am always early to work but sometimes late to other things.","I put myself out there; it's part of my job, and I get it: people will attack me. At first I was thrown off, but now I have a pretty thick skin about it.","I can't go on Gawker. I actually think the writing is really funny, but there is a chance that somebody is undercutting me.","I'm not going to say I'm a big girl. I'm a very small person, but I'm a healthy weight. That might be a little weird for Hollywood.","I did go through this period where girls would be mean and I had a lot of guy friends. But I've found as an adult the importance of having female and male friends.","The first album I bought with my own money was 'A Hard Day's Night.'","I don't like business talkers, you know, people who are constantly like, 'Blah blah blah movies.' I find it incredibly boring.","I think the best comedic actors don't play it for comedy, they play it for reality. Then you find it funny because it's real. Playing the genre is the worst thing you can do - it's embarrassing.","I think I'd say that my whole body of work is a reflection of who I am, but not any one specific thing.","What led me to be an actor is that I have a strange something in me that can drastically change the way I appear to the world. Growing up, I couldn't understand why people would always have different ideas of me - but because of that I became aware of how you can manipulate your own ability to change. And then I learned to make a career of it.","Sites like Funny or Die and College Humor are great, but I'd say it's appealing to 80% men and 20% women.","If you can make a character likable that's not very nice, that's the challenge of the job.","When you work on a movie, especially an independent movie, it's a lot of work to make it! It's not just our job as actors - so many people are working so hard, and even the littlest movie takes a lot of work.","I'd be more likely to go for somebody who is like me. Well, I like creative people, so whatever that means... Yeah, authentic and creative.","I think penguins are cute.","Classic Christmas cookies are really time-consuming. Instead, make a bar you can bake in a pan and just cut up, like a brownie or a blondie or a shortbread, which still has that Christmas vibe.","There's a vegan and gluten-free bakery called BabyCakes that I love. They've got shops in New York and Los Angeles. Their stuff is amazing.","It's very much a piece of myself when I write a song. I don't mean to say it's very personal, like the lyrics mean something personal to me. When I write a song, that's my taste in music - my taste in chord progressions and melodies.","Well, my piano's really beautiful. I actually have two pianos. I have a Yamaha upright from the '60s that's blond, wood, and black, and I also have one from the '20s from Chicago - not a well-known brand or anything.","Oh my God, there are so many songs I wish I had written. 'Waters of March,' I wish I had written 'My Baby Just Cares for Me,' I wish I had written 'This Will Be Our Year,' I mean, there's millions of them. 'Wouldn't It Be Nice?'","In a lot of movies, you'll see people on crazy dates, and you're like, 'No one would ever do that!'","Being an actress can be a little like being a girl in the '50s: You're stuck waiting by the phone, hoping that the boy you like will call.","There are so many cute vintage dresses made out of synthetics from the '60s and '70s - but they're so itchy and hot. It's not worth it!","If you're eight and you live in Los Angeles and everybody has toys and you go to a country that has a Marxist dictatorship and there are no toy stores and nobody speaks English and it's blazing hot every day and they only have fish, which you don't like, then you tend not to appreciate the cultural lessons you're learning.","Humor is a part of spirituality.","I think the best comedies came out during the Depression. Personally.","Every show is unique; some shows have the master plan and have everything figured out and that's just the way they do things. It's like high school. Some people write their papers the second they get their assignments, and some people write it the day after it's due.","I like playing sort-of-crazy people. There's something really, really fun about that.","I never have time to have a dinner. I have to eat while I'm memorizing lines. The only way to maintain energy is to eat all day long. I must eat all day long.","I played a lot of sarcastic, wisecracking characters for a long time, and people would think that was me. And it's very much not me, and then people would think I was being sarcastic when I wasn't: 'Oh, you're making fun of me right now.' And I wasn't!","For some reason, people look at me and laugh. I don't know why.","I feel there are tone singers, and there are more vocal gymnastics singers. And I think that's amazing when people can do that, but I think there's room for the tone singers. And there aren't a lot of them.","It's interesting, because as a musician, I don't feel like I need to be on the top of the pop charts.","I get embarrassed a lot of times getting attention, but I like being onstage. Do you know what I mean? If I'm in a crowd of people and they're all looking at me, I will feel embarrassed. It's a strange dichotomy.","I like acting with no lines because all of a sudden you're able to express things without always worrying about the text. It's great to have a great text, but there's a lot of stuff you can't say in words, and I think there's something really nice about good physical moments.","I think my own personal style always ends up seeping into characters that I play. I've always had a very distinct idea of fashion for myself, and what a character should wear.","I've had experiences where I wasn't allowed to change words around at all because you have to say everything, exactly as written on the page. That's not fun for me. For me, part of being an actor is being able to contribute to a character's rhythms. If there's room to explore, you find a happy medium.","When you have endless time, you take all day to go to the grocery store. But, if you have to be at work for 14 hours a day, you manage your time better. I know I do.","I just feel like growing up in Los Angeles, you learn, 'Well you're never gonna be the prettiest girl in the room, so just don't even try.' I mean, I care about being pretty, but it's not my most valued thing.","Not that there is anything wrong with confessional songwriting, there are plenty of people that do that I admire. I think it is great, it just isn't how I do things.","You go to something like the Golden Globes, and it's the most glamorous place you could ever be, but then you go home and you're still like, 'Urgh, this dress is too tight, I wanna take off these shoes and put on my pyjamas.' At the end of the night all the glamour goes away and you're just a human.","Girls get competitive, as though there's only one spot in the world for everything _ but that's not true. We need to stick together and see there's more to life than pleasing men. It's important not to cut yourself off from female friendships. I think sometimes girls get scared of other girls, but you need each other.","I wanted to be a child actor so bad that every day I'd beg my parents if I could audition, but my mom said, 'Not until you can drive yourself to auditions.'","I like to make colored xeroxes of things. I clip out pictures of Liza Minelli and her husband from magazines and I fax them to people anonymously.","I'm wary about this thing about being in the generation of social networking where people are like, 'I am my musical taste.' I am not just a collection of music. Or a collection of movies. I think that's a thing that people romanticize: 'Oh my God, she likes this band so she is a dream.'","If I could give my teenaged self any advice, it would be 'Calm down!'","Everyone needs a theme song! It should make you feel like a million dollars.","When I exercise, I like to take lots of different classes because I want to really apply myself and feel like I'm learning a new skill. Not that I ever want to have to demonstrate any of those skills!","I don't think there are that many awesome roles out there, whether we're talking about movies or TV.","Romantic comedies are usually about when love works.","Everyone romanticizes somebody.","I tend to like simple music. And clever, succinct lyrics. Songs that don't try to be more than they need to to be effective, to stir up something emotionally within you.","Do your eye shadow first, then your foundation. That way, you can clean up any mess without starting all over again.","The first job I ever had was singing in a jazz club when I was like 15 with my friend, and we earned like 70 bucks. We were like, 'Oh my God!'","We all know guys who've had their hearts broken in real life; we just don't usually see it in the movies.","I've personally never wanted to be 'the babe', and refuse to let vanity get in the way of my acting because I don't see my job as being a beautiful person.","I've never pursued a role. I always hear stories about actors going after parts and I'm, like, 'How do they do that?' It seems so weird. It seems like a total myth or something.","I've always been really picky about roles and make a point of reminding myself that it's not about the money - because, obviously, there's a lot of money to be made in this business if you're willing to do anything.","Know what suits you. Now I understand proportion and recognise the shapes that look good on my figure.","The red-carpet thing of premieres and parties is probably my least favourite part of my job.","You don't have to wear expensive clothes to look good.","Growing up in Hollywood meant there were a lot of film stars' kids at my school - but no conspicuous wealth. It wasn't cool to show off that you had money.","I love indie movies. I think that independent cinema is where it's at and where a lot of trends begin. It's where new filmmakers are breaking through.","I just like music that sounds like music. Not like machines and computers and things that you design to make things sound slick and perfect.","I was doing about five movies a year for many years. I was just so tired. I walked around feeling like a Mack truck hit me.","The average person tells a few white lies.","I still have in me the same awareness when I was 12 and chubby and a girl was spitting in my face. I'm the same person.","I know a lot of people that have had fake Twitters... actors and musicians that I know. It's sort of a problem. There are all these people that sign up thinking that they're getting somebody's real thoughts when it's just some guy.","I'm a romantic, but I'm not a romantic in the traditional sense. I like to romanticize what happens to me. Whatever happens to me - you could quantify it as good or bad - I romanticize it. I think along the lines of 'When that thing happened, it made me who I am.' That kind of thing. It's a different way of being romantic.","It's cool cause my sister is older than me and we went to the same high school, so by the time I got to high school, I got the lowdown on all the teachers and everything.","The moment you sense someone is making something because they think people are gonna buy it or like it, it's just so phony! The public has a nose for phony like nobody else.","Secretly, I think everyone who makes fun of California really does want to be in California.","I listened to a lot of Joni Mitchell in high school. She was sort of an inspiration to me. I think she's a great lyricist, and she makes interesting choices.","I appreciate a songwriter like Morrissey with so much restraint.","I don't know how to explain how, probably to my detriment, unselfpromoting I am. I used to have a cabaret act and I didn't even like to tell me people about that. I really hate selling myself.","There are a lot of actors who will sit here and talk to you about characters - 'He does this, and she's a really interesting character because she does this.' I'm not like that at all. I'm not an actory actor.","One thing I love about Christmas music is that it has a tradition of warmth.","Modern recording has made it so that people can spend forever taking shortcuts and making everything uniform, but that strips music of what makes it exciting.","I remember having this friend in school who said she didn't like the Beach Boys. And in that moment I knew we couldn't be friends anymore."],"Zora Neale Hurston":["Research is formalized curiosity. It is poking and prying with a purpose.","Trees and plants always look like the people they live with, somehow.","No matter how far a person can go the horizon is still way beyond you.","Sometimes, I feel discriminated against, but it does not make me angry. It merely astonishes me. How can any deny themselves the pleasure of my company? It's beyond me.","I do not weep at the world I am too busy sharpening my oyster knife.","Grab the broom of anger and drive off the beast of fear.","If you want that good feeling that comes from doing things for other folks then you have to pay for it in abuse and misunderstanding.","There are years that ask questions and years that answer.","Love makes your soul crawl out from its hiding place.","Those that don't got it, can't show it. Those that got it, can't hide it.","Ships at a distance have every man's wish on board.","I regret all of my books.","The present was an egg laid by the past that had the future inside its shell.","A thing is mighty big when time and distance cannot shrink it.","Anybody depending on somebody else's gods is depending on a fox not to eat chickens.","Mama exhorted her children at every opportunity to 'jump at the sun.' We might not land on the sun, but at least we would get off the ground.","It would be against all nature for all the Negroes to be either at the bottom, top, or in between. We will go where the internal drive carries us like everybody else. It is up to the individual.","I have been in Sorrow's kitchen and licked out all the pots. Then I have stood on the peaky mountain wrapped in rainbows, with a harp and sword in my hands.","But for the national welfare, it is urgent to realize that the minorities do think, and think about something other than the race problem.","It's a funny thing, the less people have to live for, the less nerve they have to risk losing nothing.","Gods always behave like the people who make them.","It's no use of talking unless people understand what you say.","It costs you something to do good!","It seems to me that trying to live without friends is like milking a bear to get cream for your morning coffee. It is a whole lot of trouble, and then not worth much after you get it.","When one is too old for love, one finds great comfort in good dinners.","It seems that fighting is a game where everybody is the loser.","Sweat, sweat, sweat! Work and sweat, cry and sweat, pray and sweat!","It is one of the blessings of this world that few people see visions and dream dreams.","I did not just fall in love. I made a parachute jump.","Nothing that God ever made is the same thing to more than one person. That is natural.","There is something about poverty that smells like death.","No man may make another free.","Love, I find, is like singing. Everybody can do enough to satisfy themselves, though it may not impress the neighbors as being very much.","People can be slave-ships in shoes.","The Haitian people are gentle and lovable except for their enormous and unconscious cruelty.","Gods always love the people who make em.","So the brother in black offers to these United States the source of courage that endures, and laughter.","When a man keeps beating me to the draw mentally, he begins to get glamorous.","It was a weak spot in any nation to have a large body of disaffected people within its confusion.","The man who interprets Nature is always held in great honor."],"Zosia Mamet":["I'm a little bit of a weirdo - I'm kind of a loner, I didn't go to college, I spend a lot of my time reading. I've been working since I was 17, so that's sort of been my life.","People idealize or reminisce about their 20s, but nobody tells you beforehand that it's hard and unglamorous and often very unpleasant.","I went to a strict elementary school with nuns, and uniforms that I'm pretty sure were made out of sandpaper. It was an academic, sports-oriented place. I liked to read, and wanted to act, and didn't try out for volleyball. I was weird. The other girls would dip my hair in ink and stuff.","I have a ship's bed, which totally plays to my obsession of, if I were not an actress, I would be a pirate.","I have quite a foul mouth.","I am a private human.","I don't know if I would call myself a religious human.","I don't watch much television. My old TV agent used to always get mad at me because he'd send me out on auditions and I'd be like, 'What's this show?' and he'd be like, 'It's literally the top show on television.' I wasn't allowed to watch TV as a kid.","I think any actor in their right mind is afraid of getting pigeonholed.","I did 'Mad Men' and I still have people come up to me like, 'Are you actually a lesbian?' Really? Just because I play one on TV? People will think what they're gonna think.","I would have been miserable in college. I always hated school.","Comedy arises out of necessity, because some things are so dark that you have to laugh about it.","I grew up backstage and on movie sets, and I thought they were the most magical places on Earth.","All the characters on 'Girls' are growing and changing, which is how real people behave, especially when we're young, trying to figure out who we are, doing things that are the polar opposite of our characteristics.","My dad has always been really helpful. He taught me that talent is a bonus, but persistence is what wins out.","With 'Girls,' it doesn't really feel like I'm doing TV specifically. It just feels like we're making a really long film.","I am an avid reader! As for writing, I might - someday. But we'll have to wait and see.","But my father was also the one who told me I needed to clean up my mouth or I'd never find a man. What's very important to him is manners. Show up on time. Always send thank-you letters. He is one of the more thoughtful humans I've ever met. He's a great man and a very good dad.","I think feminism's a bit misinterpreted. It was about casting off all gender roles. There's nothing wrong with a man holding a door open for a girl. But we sort of threw away all the rules, so everybody's confused. And dating becomes a sloppy, uncomfortable, unpleasant thing.","I miss my horse. He's in Los Angeles.","My mom was onstage when she was pregnant with me.","Give me an 18-hour day on set or in the theater, and I will be the happiest person alive.","I haven't found it to be particularly enjoyable... ninety percent of the time when I go on dates, I'm thinking, 'I could be reading my book instead.'","The lighthearted moments of 'Girls' are really not speckled throughout and that to me is just super exciting, to be able to delve into the darkness that you are greeted with in your early 20s and the fear and what that makes you do, the places that you can potentially go with that.","A lot of people in line at the grocery store think that they know me, but they don't."],"Zsa Zsa Gabor":["Macho does not prove mucho.","Being jealous of a beautiful woman is not going to make you more beautiful.","I tell you, in this world, being a little crazy helps to keep you sane.","I never really mind what people say about me - I am far too unconventional and far too dedicated to being true to myself to let other people's disdain or nastiness upset me for long.","I have learned that not diamonds but divorce lawyers are a girl's best friend.","Diamonds are a girl's best friend, and dogs are a man's best friend. Now you know which sex has more sense.","All my life, I have been a positive thinker... I have always been able to survive by telling myself that no matter how bad things are, they will one day be better. And that out of every event - no matter how tragic - one can always find a way to survive and even, perhaps, to be a little bit happy.","I want a man who's kind and understanding. Is that too much to ask of a millionaire?","A man in love is incomplete until he has married. Then he's finished.","What is really important for a woman, you know, even more than being beautiful or intelligent, is to be entertaining.","Husbands are like fires - they go out when unattended.","Any woman who diets all the time can't help but be grouchy. Nobody can be amusing or entertaining on a diet.","The only way to learn a language properly, in fact, is to marry a man of that nationality. You get what they call in Europe a 'sleeping dictionary.' Of course, I have only been married five times, and I speak seven languages. I'm still trying to remember where I picked up the other two.","There is nothing wrong with a woman encouraging a man's advances, as long as they are in cash.","If you can fight directly with your mother, you can save a fortune in psychiatrist's bills.","I don't accept gifts from perfect strangers - but then, nobody's perfect.","I am a horsewoman. I am a princess. I am Zsa Zsa.","My advice is not always so logical and consistent. But then, love is not logical and consistent. So why should my advice be? If you want that kind of thinking, go to a computer. Computers are always logical and consistent, and you see how often they get proposed to.","Being jealous of a beautiful woman is not going to make you beautiful.","I never hated a man enough to give him diamonds back.","I call everyone 'Darling' because I can't remember their names.","The minute I understand a man, he is no longer exciting and a challenge to me. And the last thing in the world I want is for a man to understand me and know what's always going on inside my head. It takes away from all my mystery, which, as I've told you before, is the most important thing between a man and a woman.","Men fall in love with their eyes - they like what they see - and women fall in love with their ears - they like what they hear!","To a smart girl men are no problem - they're the answer.","You never really know a man until you have divorced him.","A girl must marry for love - and keep on marrying until she finds it.","I admit I have a Hungarian temper. Why not? I am from Hungary. We are descendants of Genghis Khan and Attila the Hun.","I know nothing about sex, because I was always married.","To be loved is a strength. To love is a weakness.","There is no bigger aphrodisiac than power.","I am a marvelous housekeeper. Every time I leave a man I keep his house.","If you like a man and he likes you, you should get married as fast as you can. Otherwise, you both are going to change your minds. There's plenty of time for that after marriage.","I love to put on diamonds and beautiful evening gowns and make my girl-friends upset.","Getting divorced just because you don't love a man is almost as silly as getting married just because you do.","How many husbands have I had? You mean apart from my own?","I only cook when I'm in love.","I believe in large families: every woman should have at least three husbands.","You must be independent and able to do for yourself. Then you do not have to marry a rich man; you can marry a poor one. And if it is wrong, you can go.","Every girl should be married at least once in her life. It's a must. Because once you have been married, you are a Mrs., and even if the marriage doesn't work out, they can't take that away from you.","I deserve attention not because of any talent, but just because of who I am.","As a teenager, I preferred the company of boys to girls, focusing always on the most indifferent male and flirting with him until he became my slave.","One of my theories is that men love with their eyes; women love with their ears.","The feather in your cap is to get a man you love who'll marry you.","It's not hard to find a new husband, but someone who is, for an example, a good bridge partner for you comes along once in a lifetime.","When I'm alone, I can sleep crossways in bed without an argument.","We were both in love with him. I fell out of love with him, but he didn't.","The women's movement hasn't changed my sex life. It wouldn't dare.","I don't remember anybody's name. How do you think the 'dahling' thing got started?","Conrad Hilton was very generous to me in the divorce settlement. He gave me 5000 Gideon Bibles.","I think I'm very old-fashioned.","I always liked parties. You meet people; you can have fun.","I pay all my own bills... I want to choose the man. I do not permit men to choose me.","I like a mannish man: a man who knows how to talk to and treat a woman - not just a man with muscles.","A woman who tells her age tells everything, and I won't tell it.","It's never as easy to keep your own spouse happy as it is to make someone else's spouse happy.","Love should be an inspiration, not an obligation.","I'm not a girl who sits home and knits, you know.","I'm a compulsive buyer. Anything beautiful I see I want. That's how we got the Waldorf Astoria. I told Conrad Hilton, 'I want the Waldorf,' and he bought it. The only problem was I divorced him before the escrow was finished.","I wasn't born, I was ordered from room service.","I am not a name-dropper. I can't help it if everybody I know is famous.","I was hired because I am Zsa Zsa Gabor, but when I go to work, directors try to force their methods on me. John Huston's intense, precise directions tortured me.","Of course I love being in love - but it is marriage that really fulfills me. But not in every case.","I've never been jealous. I've never had to be."],"Zubin Mehta":["Indian hotels are doing well globally because they understand hospitality.","I love rap because it talks about pain that comes authentically from the ghetto. It moves me.","Even in music concerts in Mumbai and different parts of the world, seats are reserved for sponsors.","Just imagine, the thousands and thousands of concerts that take place every single day, all over the world. And the positive effect that they would have on the people listening. Now imagine a world without this. This void... it is unthinkable.","The amount of culture going on in a small country like Israel is amazing.","I am jealous of all those people who live on the shore of Dal Lake.","All these people who scream about Kashmir being an armed camp are in fact responsible for keeping it that way.","My father was a trained accountant, a BCom from Sydenham College and a self-taught violinist. In the 1920s, when he was in his teens, he heard a great violinist, Jascha Heifetz, and he was so inspired listening to him that he bought himself a violin, and with a little help from an Italian teacher, he learned to play it.","Rock music is predictable, unless there's great talent involved.","Israel gives the West Bank water twice a week! One way of promoting good would be not to ration water.","Music is the message of peace, and music only brings peace.","One learns how to change gears within a concert repertoire.","I'm a Persian Jew, and we don't speak Hebrew.","It's hard to find an emblem of cultural, national pride that burns as bright as Israel's success in classical music.","I miss the standard of the New York Philharmonic's playing very much. It has certainly been a high point in my life.","You might say that Richard Wagner was the Queen Victoria of Europe. He had musical children everywhere!","Open rehearsals reach people who might not otherwise hear the Philharmonic - people on fixed incomes, people who can't move easily at night, students.","Some musical directors have more chutzpah. They pick up the phone and talk people into giving. I prefer to call and say 'thank you' after the money has been contributed.","Wagner's philosophy had absolutely nothing to do with Bruckner. Bruckner hadn't written a single word against Jews. Wagner's book on the Jews was one of the most infamous books of the 19th century.","I feel growing up in Mumbai is an advantage, as we grow up speaking so many languages that when we go abroad, it becomes easier to learn new languages.","There are three orchestras in Munich, all world-quality, in a city of one million. Yet every hall is full.","I'm hopeful that Israelis can go to Ramallah whenever they want and see how the people are living.","In Chicago, they die for their teams.","New York for a long time was a kind of conductor's graveyard.","One shouldn't know the future.","Israel is a piece of real estate that neither Jew or Arab will let go of; neither will leave these shores. And so they will have to learn to live together.","Let's try to count the number of Nobel prize-winners that have emerged from scientific centres of excellence like the Weizmann Institute and Haifa's technical university, the Technion. There has to be at least 25.","I just want to play for Hindus and Muslims that sit together. That's all I want to do.","As long as they keep building settlements, the world will be anti-Israeli.","I wish that only three residents of Tel Aviv could see what conditions on the West Bank are like. Living in such proximity, most Israelis have no idea about the adversity on the West Bank.","I believe in music.","My tastes are Viennese.","Citizens of India, Pakistan, and Kashmir need to come together and make music.","I'm very much tied to the state of Israel, but I am against their policy of settlements in Palestine.","I am not only a Parsi, I am a Kashmiri too.","I have had bullets flying at concerts, but I don't want to talk about that.","There are people who think I am Israeli. That's rubbish.","It seems always to have been difficult to have been a New York Philharmonic conductor because of the nature of New York. We are in direct competition with the great orchestras in the world who come to play in our hall or in Carnegie, and we are constantly compared. I think that 's a good thing.","I think conductors do spend too little time with their orchestras.","I sometimes feel it is to my disadvantage that I have not conducted the Cleveland Orchestra or the Boston or Chicago symphonies, but then I have had to sacrifice something in order to have enough time with my orchestras.","An American orchestra doesn't want to play more than it has to. I respectfully disagree with that attitude.","Bruckner's Eighth is a colossus.","My parents had chosen the medical profession for me. I even studied a few semesters at St Xavier's College, but at the back of my mind, I always wanted to be a musician like my father.","If North American musicians would only know how uncomfortable life is for European musicians.","I always look at the work of fashion designers as if they were art.","Go to the young conductors who are not making it, and you will hear how we shouldn't push ourselves or sell ourselves, how they don't have the right connections and the right opportunities. Well, you can be sure they've had the opportunities.","I would convert to Judaism if the operation didn't hurt so much.","I'm a pucca Indian. Bombay is my home.","I love India.","There was an opinion expressed in the newspapers that, after 20 years, maybe the Israel Philharmonic should consider asking me to leave. I thought they might have a point, so I asked my orchestra. They told me overwhelmingly that they wanted me to stay.","I'm really not a party person. I'm in the business of working with 100 people every day, so I don't revel in meeting a roomful of people in my leisure time.","After conducting Wagner, Beethoven's triple concerto is like taking an Alka Seltzer.","The New York Philharmonic is a tremendous opportunity, a great orchestra.","New York is really the place to be; to go to New York, you're going to the center of the world, the lion's den.","I feel that the critic and music director should have such a good relationship they can pick up the phone and call each other any time.","My life is so full of sacrifices.","I've never said, 'I live for art.'","I have a few homes, and Los Angeles is certainly one of them.","I am often critical of Israel's policies when in the country, but then feel defensive of them when overseas.","Why does Israel always have to suffer for others to feel bad for it?","As soon as, say, Saddam Hussein started bombing Israel with Scuds, everyone was like, 'Poor Israel.' But when Israel retaliates - and most of the time they then win - people turn against them.","I am always hearing from Israelis, 'Oh, CNN is anti-Israel,' or 'BBC is against us.' But no, they are reporting facts.","We are so indebted to our ancestors, musically speaking, that they have left us 400 years of music.","In truth, I became a conductor because deep down I wanted to conduct Brahms's four symphonies and Richard Strauss's tone poems.","If you can sing together, you can live together.","I endeavor that all orchestras I conduct sound Central European.","My temples are only in India. When I am in India, I go to the religious ceremonies.","I love to conduct opera.","My family and relatives alone could fill Shanmukhananda Hall in Bombay.","I am an Indian, so I do yoga.","I knew at university that medicine was just not for me. I saved many lives by not being a doctor!","I've known Pinchas Zukerman since he was a teenager.","Though there is such a rich tradition of culture and arts, I have never been invited to perform at a concert in South India.","I have been to Kashmir many times, especially with my family, in the '70s.","There are certainly talented instrumentalists coming from India. I see them performing all over the world.","In Bombay, we have a fine concert hall. I think it is high time we built venues in Delhi and Calcutta, not only for western music, but also Indian music. It doesn't matter which party is in power; don't you think the capital of India should have a concert hall?","The private sector is growing so incredibly in India, in every city you have industries for whom building a concert hall would be nothing financially. But they just don't do it.","American musicians are very giving - they have the highest standard in the world - but they are also very demanding in their conditions."],"Zuleikha Robinson":["When I got the role in 'Homeland,' it really opened something up. Other people respected me more as an actor, doors were opened, and I understood for the first time that it wasn't personal. All that rejection wasn't personal.","I definitely like to play characters that don't fit any kind of mold; that are slightly offbeat, because it's more fun to play.","'Lone Gunmen' was my first job, and I got a little cocky, thinking I'm brilliant and don't have to work that hard because it comes so naturally.","I do like to play the darker characters; I don't really know why.","It took a lot of time to find my stride, and it was really humbling.","I did go through a phase where I played videogames quite often, but I haven't in a few years.","Only twice have I really had a hard time leaving a character. The first was my character in 'Rome' and then in 'Homeland.'","I like to frequent antiques shops and flea markets like the Rose Bowl in Pasadena.","I'm mostly vegetarian.","The only time a friend has ever helped me in the industry was how I got my first job - that was through Mike Figgis.","I honestly never really watch the Emmys."],"Zygmunt Bauman":["The risk of the Holocaust is not that it will be forgotten, but that it will be embalmed and surrounded by monuments and used to absolve all future sins.","In a liquid modern life there are no permanent bonds, and any that we take up for a time must be tied loosely so that they can be untied again, as quickly and as effortlessly as possible, when circumstances change - as they surely will in our liquid modern society, over and over again.","We live in a world of communication - everyone gets information about everyone else. There is universal comparison and you don't just compare yourself with the people next door, you compare yourself to people all over the world and with what is being presented as the decent, proper and dignified life. It's the crime of humiliation.","We live in a globalising world. That means that all of us, consciously or not, depend on each other. Whatever we do or refrain from doing affects the lives of people who live in places we'll never visit.","We belong to talking, not what talking is about... Stop talking - and you are out. Silence equals exclusion.","There are other ways of finding satisfaction, recipes for human happiness, enjoyment, dignified and meaningful, gratifying life, than increased consumption that increases production.","The task for sociology is to come to the help of the individual. We have to be in service of freedom. It is something we have lost sight of.","Partnerships are increasingly seen through the prism of promises and expectations, and as a kind of product for consumers: satisfaction on the spot, and if not fully satisfied, return the product to the shop or replace it with a new and improved one! You don't, after all, stick to your car, or computer, or iPod, when better ones appear.","Happiness needs one-upmanship.","The carrying power of a bridge is not the average strength of the pillars, but the strength of the weakest pillar. I have always believed that you do not measure the health of a society by GNP but by the condition of its worst off.","As far as love is concerned, possession, power, fusion and disenchantment are the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.","Capitalism proceeds through creative destruction. What is created is capitalism in a 'new and improved' form - and what is destroyed is self-sustaining capacity, livelihood and dignity of its innumerable and multiplied 'host organisms' into which all of us are drawn/seduced one way or another.","Civilisation, the orderly world in which we live, is frail. We are skating on thin ice. There is a fear of a collective disaster. Terrorism, genocide, flu, tsunamis.","Unlike 'real relationships', 'virtual relationships' are easy to enter and to exit. They look smart and clean, feel easy to use, when compared with the heavy, slow-moving, messy real stuff.","In a consumer society, people wallow in things, fascinating, enjoyable things. If you define your value by the things you acquire and surround yourself with, being excluded is humiliating.","Human attention tends to be focused on the satisfactions relationships are hoped to bring, precisely because somehow they have not been truly satisfactory. And if they do satisfy, the price of this satisfaction has often been found to be unacceptable.","I was leftwing, I am leftwing, and I will die leftwing.","Power, in a nutshell, is the ability to get things done, and politics is the ability to decide which things need to be done.","Why do I write books? Why do I think? Why should I be passionate? Because things could be different, they could be made better.","We already have - thanks to technology, development, skills, the efficiency of our work - enough resources to satisfy all human needs. But we don't have enough resources, and we are unlikely ever to have, to satisfy human greed.","The consumerist culture insists that swearing eternal loyalty to anything and anybody is imprudent, since in this world new glittering opportunities crop up daily.","Attempts to tame the wayward and domesticate the riotous, to make the unknowable predictable and enchain the free-roaming - all such things sound the death knell to love.","I suspect that one of capitalism's crucial assets derives from the fact that the imagination of economists, including its critics, lags well behind its own inventiveness, the arbitrariness of its undertaking and the ruthlessness of the way in which it proceeds.","In our world of rampant 'individualisation', relationships are mixed blessings. They vacillate between a sweet dream and a nightmare, and there is no telling when one turns into the other.","This awful concept of underclass is really horrifying. You're not lower class, you are excluded - outside.","Like the phoenix, socialism is reborn from every pile of ashes left day in, day out, by burnt-out human dreams and charred hopes.","Relationships, like cars, should undergo regular services to make sure they are still roadworthy.","In a world of global dependencies with no corresponding global polity and few tools of global justice, the rich of the world are free to pursue their own interests while paying no attention to the rest."]}
