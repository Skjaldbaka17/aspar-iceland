{"I. F. Stone":["The difference between burlesque and the newspapers is that the former never pretended to be performing a public service by exposure.","Every government is run by liars and nothing they say should be believed.","If God, as some now say, is dead, He no doubt died of trying to find an equitable solution to the Arab-Jewish problem.","Rich people march on Washington every day.","The only thing God didn't do to Job was give him a computer.","Every emancipation has in it the seeds of a new slavery, and every truth easily becomes a lie.","All governments are run by liars and nothing they say should be believed."],"I. King Jordan":["Differences among deaf people are okay, but we need to recognize those differences and work together.","I grew up outside Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in a little town, and went to a regular high school. I was a... very average student in that high school. Then I joined the Navy, and while I was in the Navy, I was in a motorcycle accident and woke up deaf in a hospital.","There are people who are born deaf and grow up deaf who don't speak at all, and some of them have told me that they resent a little bit that I do speak. But, you know, I have to be myself. I have to do what I'm comfortable doing.","I'm committed to sign in everything I communicate, but I also speak. I still believe that I reach more people when I do that. I bridge two different cultures and two different worlds, and I think that bridge still needs work.","I lived for a year in Scotland. British sign language is very different from American.","After becoming deaf, I realized that I'd better get an education if I was ever to do anything with my life.","At Gallaudet, deafness isn't an issue. You don't even think about it. Students can pay attention to accounting or psychology or journalism. But when a deaf person goes to another college, no matter how supportive it is, that person doesn't get the same access.","I'm a psychologist. I was a psychology faculty member, and then I became an administrator of the department, then the Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences. At the time of the presidential search, I was the dean."],"I. M. Pei":["A city, far from being a cluster of buildings, is actually a sequence of spaces enclosed and defined by buildings.","In northern architecture - the cathedrals of Europe and all the little churches - the details, the carving of stone, become necessary because the light is not there to help you very much. You have to enrich surfaces. The desert reduces form to its simplest nature. There is no need for gargoyles or flying buttresses in the desert.","The essence of architecture is form and space, and light is the essential element to the key to architectural design, probably more important than anything. Technology and materials are secondary.","We had a lot of difficulty in getting the French to accept the pyramid. They thought we were trying to import a piece of Egypt until I pointed out that their obelisk was also from Egypt and the Place des Pyramides is around the corner. Then they accepted it. The pyramid at the Louvre, though, is just the tip.","A lasting architecture has to have roots.","I think the artistic side of architecture was natural to me. My mother was an artist and a poet.","To me, form doesn't always follow function. Form has a life of its own, and at times, it may be the motivating force in design. When you're dealing with form as a sculptor, you feel that you are quite free in attempting to mould and shape things you want to do, but in architecture, it's much more difficult because it has to have a function.","The Louvre for me is a wonderful experience. Because it continues; it didn't get cut off. It was actually a continuous involvement all the way, and a lot of people have come and gone, come and gone; but I'm still here.","Architecture must not do violence to space or its neighbors.","It is good to learn from the ancients. I'm a bit of an ancient myself. They had a lot of time to think about architecture and landscape.","One thing I learn - I've been in practice now for half a century or more, and the most important ingredient for an architect to do a good building is to have a good client. I think a client counts for as much as fifty per cent.","Even a beautiful piece of work can be overshadowed, destroyed, by something else.","Modern architecture needed to be part of an evolutionary, not a revolutionary, process.","I'd been going to the Louvre since 1951. I thought I knew Paris and the French, but I didn't really. You know how easy it is to make friends when you are traveling. People are curious about you, you are curious about them. But you never really make friends that way. After the Louvre, I discovered that I have friends now because I have enemies.","I liked the America of Bing Crosby, Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton - it was all a dream, of course, but a very alluring dream for a young man from Canton.","The first decent building I did with my own practice was a chapel in Taiwan.","Contemporary architects tend to impose modernity on something. There is a certain concern for history, but it's not very deep.","I arrived in the U.S.A. in 1935, to San Francisco. I got the boat from China, and I didn't even speak English. I could read a little, perhaps write a little, but that was all. It was a 17-day journey, and I learnt to speak English from the stewards.","I've never left China. My family's been there for 600 years. But my architecture is not consciously Chinese in any sense. I'm a western architect.","I came, I studied architecture in America, so my technical background's completely western. But my seventeen years, the formative years of one's life, and I can't say that the Chineseness in me is not there.","I have a great love for nature. That must have started somewhere down back home, I think, because my family own one of the better known gardens in Soochow, so I played there, and I lived there, and so I must have absorbed something there. So I continue to have a great interest in nature.","The Pyramids are perfect, but you can't put the Pyramids in the middle of Manhattan. In the desert, the combination of light and form makes it perfect."],"Iain Banks":["Torture is such a slippery slope; as soon as you allow a society or any legal system to do that, almost instantly you get a situation where people are being tortured for very trivial reasons.","I think a lot of people are frightened of technology and frightened of change, and the way to deal with something you're frightened of is to make fun of it. That's why science fiction fans are dismissed as geeks and nerds.","You get so caught up in what you're writing - action sequences tend to do that more than anything else because you're living it, and feeling for your characters.","As long as a film stays unmade, the book is entirely yours, it belongs to the writer. As soon as you make it into a film, suddenly more people see it than have ever read the book.","I still find it hard to understand that anyone could argue that you can't have machines that exhibit consciousness.","I think the future stopped looking American when you think back to Blade Runner and Neuromancer, when it started to look more Japanese.","I'm not a great believer in awards-of course the fact that I've never won one has nothing to do with it at all!","You have to have something worth saying and then the ability to say it- writing's a double skill, really.","As a writer, you get to play, you get alter time, you get to come up with the smart lines and the clever comebacks you wish you'd thought of.","I wouldn't like to be a character in one of my books!","Technology determines the possibilities of society. It doesn't matter whether you start out from a fascist state or a communist state or a free-market state.","By the usual reckoning, the worst books make the best films.","My point has always been that, ever since the Industrial Revolution, science fiction has been the most important genre there is.","Most mainstream male fiction is littered with heroines, and female characters are basically so great, you want to fall in love with them.","In so much of politics you're not allowed to disagree with what's been agreed.","I've always loved Scotland, and I'm not a huge fan of big cities, to be honest. I like them to dip into for a bit, but I'm not sure I would want to live in one again.","I think we need politicians; we need people who want to serve.","I still have some of my old University essays, and I do still have my drawing book from primary year seven.","Smell is a very animal thing, almost reptilian, where the more cerebral things like reading less so.","I deliberately keep myself apart from a lot of stuff; I don't Tweet, I don't do Facebook, I don't blog, and that's largely because I spend my working life staring at a screen and hitting a keyboard, I am trying to cut down on that, not increase it.","I remember being shocked when I discovered some of my school pals didn't have books in their homes. I thought it was like not having oxygen, or hot water.","I love writing and can't imagine not being able to do it. I want an easy life and if it had been difficult I wouldn't be doing it. I do admire writers who do it even though it costs them.","In theory, I work an eight-hour day and a five-day week which means I can socialise with my pals who mostly have normal jobs like teaching and computer programming.","I'm an only child so am happy with my own company and I don't really get lonely.","A lot of what the 'Culture' is about is a reaction to all the science fiction I was reading in my very early teens.","Even in my side of the world, I've been in publishing for what, 25 or 26 years, and it's gone from being a gentlemen's club to being a few big players, and it's very corporatised.","Science fiction is trying to find alternative ways of looking at realities.","'Dead Air' is full of rants; it's a rant-based book. Yes, it's self-indulgence. I plead guilty; mea culpa.","I enjoy it too much - even if I knew I'd never get a book published, I would still write. I enjoy the experience of getting thoughts and ideas and plots and characters organised into this narrative framework.","I don't really do themes. I might accidentally, but themes are an emergent phenomena of the writing of the book, of just trying to get a story out there.","I just come up with the stories and write them as well as I can. There's not really a great deal of strokey-beard thinking going on.","There is a quite a lot of effort involved but I find action sequences some of the quickest to write and the most fun.","Science fiction has its own history, its own legacy of what's been done, what's been superseded, what's so much part of the furniture it's practically part of the fabric now, what's become no more than a joke... and so on. It's just plain foolish, as well as comically arrogant, to ignore all this, to fail to do the most basic research."],"Iain De Caestecker":["My mom was always keen I stayed in school and got good grades, and she was always keen for me to do medicine. I used to go to drama classes when I was younger, and she would always take me. But when I got to an age when I decided it was what I wanted to do, when she accepted it, she had actually been the most supportive person ever.","When I was younger, me and my brother got a video camera, and he used to direct and I used to act. We used to make these silly, stupid short films, which, looking back now, were probably horrible.","I remember my first actor that I really, really fell in love with was Tom Hanks. I suppose when I was growing up and getting more serious about acting, at that point, he was the biggest actor in the world.","Always just remember that you can never know all; you're always going to be learning; there's always going to be something new. I don't think you'll ever have it all figured out.","I do actually have a connection with James Herriot because we went to school in the same area. I went to Hillhead Primary School in the West End of Glasgow and he went to Hillhead Secondary."],"Iain Duncan Smith":["Luck is great, but most of life is hard work.","Do not underestimate the determination of a quiet man.","A system that was originally designed to support the poorest in society is now trapping them in the very condition it was supposed to alleviate.","My personal view is always I'm in favour of anything that gives parliament a greater say. That's after all what we were elected for.","The financial costs of family breakdown are incredibly high.","Gang members have invariably grown up in broken, chaotic homes, often experiencing domestic violence; they have truanted from school and many have been formally excluded; and they live in neighbourhoods where worklessness, addiction and crime are rife.","All too often, government's response to social breakdown has been a classic case of 'patching' - a case of handing money out, containing problems and limiting the damage but, in doing so, supporting - even reinforcing - dysfunctional behaviour.","The public thinks that homelessness is about not having any accommodation to go to.","You know in my own area of Waltham Forest, we've had many murders as a result of the gang violence and often innocent bystanders get caught up in it.","We do not celebrate people who have made success out of serious hard work.","When families are strong and stable, so are children - showing higher levels of wellbeing and more positive outcomes. But when things go wrong - either through family breakdown or a damaged parental relationship - the impact on a child's later life can be devastating.","The future of Conservatism lies in our beliefs and values, not by throwing them away. We need to shed associations that bind us to past failures, but hold faith with those things that make us Conservatives.","With the right support, a child growing up in a dysfunctional household, who was destined for a lifetime on benefits could be put on an entirely different track - one which sees them move into fulfilling and sustainable work. In doing so, they will pull themselves out of poverty.","I think almost every political leader is always told that the next speech they make is the most crucial one.","If you look at the footballers, you look at our celebrity culture, we seem to be saying, 'This is the way you want to be'. We seem to be a society that celebrates all the wrong people.","Kids are meant to believe that their stepping stone to massive money is 'The X Factor.' Luck is great, but most of life is hard work. We do not celebrate people who have made success out of serious hard work.","Balance is if you try hard, you work hard then the rewards are in balance with what you put in and what is available.","In Birmingham, Manchester or Liverpool there are white gangs that share the same backgrounds - they come from broken homes, completely dysfunctional, mums for the most part unable to cope, the fathers of these kids completely not in the scene.","That thing, 'You must stay together for the kids', is out of fashion but is right. It's not arguing parents that children don't like, it is having one parent.","With participation in politics so low at the moment I think Christians should ensure their views are represented at all levels and not leave it to others.","Aspiration, it seems, is in danger of becoming the preserve of the wealthy.","If Britain is to have a stable, affordable pension system, people need to work longer, but we will reward their hard work with a decent state pension that will enable them to enjoy quality of life in their retirement.","After years of piecemeal reform the current welfare system is complex and unfair.","For those who are able to work, work has to be seen as the best route out of poverty. For work is not just about more money - it is transformative. It's about taking responsibility for yourself and your family.","Every parent wants to know that their children are protected against those who have a particular agenda until they get old enough to make decisions for themselves.","Too many couples break up without understanding the consequences for their families.","We do a disservice to society if we ignore the evidence which shows that stable families tend to be associated with better outcomes for children.","There are few more powerful tools for promoting stability than the institution of marriage.","Over the years the political establishment has frowned if a mainstream politician mentions marriage.","Even as our economy starts to pick up, and new jobs are created, there is a risk that young people in Britain won't get the chances they deserve because businesses will continue to look elsewhere.","A good proportion of foreign nationals in jobs in the UK are in semi or low-skilled occupations.","No I'm not a great believer in getting back over things and saying if only, or if, or buts because I don't think we actually get anywhere on that.","No one out there is interested in who did what to whom in Westminster politics.","Well football teams are perhaps easier to control than political parties, I'm sure the Prime Minister would agree with me, but yeah I think every team needs discipline and a sense of self-belief and that's important, that's what leadership's all about.","What happened I think on Sept. 11 was we were given graphic and clear evidence that things had changed.","Well obviously the economy is critical to everything we do and we need to get the economy back in shape, the deficit down, the debt paid off, so that the economy can grow again and grow properly.","People work hard.","The fact is that in too many communities in cities in Britain gangs now have become completely rooted into these communities and they destroy them around them.","With high underemployment - currently over one million part-time workers in the UK want to work more hours - sanctioning clients who cannot increase their hours seems to be both unworkable and unfair.","Kids are meant to believe that their stepping stone to massive money is 'The X Factor.'","Look, I've always said from the word go many years ago that I felt the whole bonus culture, they need to think very carefully about being detached from the rest of the British public.","I went up to the top of the career ladder and I came down again, I am past all that.","There is nothing people can throw at me to say: 'Do this, do that.'","Can there not be a limit to the fact that really you need to cut your cloth in accordance with what capabilities and finances you have?","My view is pensioners don't have the one option that people of working age have. They can't really increase their income, because they are no longer able to work.","Work is transformative. It gives you a greater chance of a greater income. You can affect your life while you're of working age, so you have scope and opportunity. Pensioners do not.","We do need to have a little bit more protection and sensibility around pensioners. They are remarkable. They gave so much. We need to make sure we do our best by them.","It's fairness to say those who work hard, get up in the morning, cut their cloth - in other words 'we can only afford to have one or two children because we don't earn enough'. They pay their taxes and they want to know that the same kind of decision-making is taking place for those on benefits.","By measuring the proportion of children living with the same parents from birth and whether their parents report a good quality relationship we are driving home the message that social programmes should promote family stability and avert breakdown.","Due to the reliance on the old heavy industries in many parts of the country, it makes perfect sense that we need to spend more money per head of population on welfare support in Scotland.","Thankfully, due to the United Kingdom and the commitment of the Westminster government we are able to ensure that money brought in, whether it be from the City of London or from North Sea oil, can be pooled and directed to wherever it is needed most. That is what being in the United Kingdom is all about.","In many ways, Scotland will benefit more than other parts of the UK when Universal Credit comes in. A larger percentage of people will see an increase in their income through moving into work or taking on more hours.","I do not believe the picture that some people paint of Scottish towns dependent on welfare. Every time I come here, I meet people who are determined to get into work. Who, with the right help are desperate to get off benefits, support their family and set an example for their children.","The BBC is locked to the reading of the economy that is run out of Ed Miliband and Ed Balls' office. They think if only you spend and borrow more money you can create growth everywhere.","When the news is good, the BBC view is: 'Get the government out of the picture quickly, don't allow them to say anything about it.' When the news is bad: 'Let's all dump on the government.'","Getting a family into work, supporting strong relationships, getting parents off drugs and out of debt - all this can do more for a child's well-being than any amount of money in out-of-work benefits.","We have to ensure that our immigration system works in the interests of Britain, enabling us to make a realistic promise to our young school-leavers. It is part of our contract with the British people.","Government cannot do it all. As we work hard to break welfare dependency and get young people ready for the labour market, we need businesses to give them a chance and not just fall back on labour from abroad.","I am an optimist about the UK. We have been involved in trade with our European partners, which we will always be doing whatever this relationship is. We are a member of the EU. That gives us benefits. But we have to figure out where that is going. In the world, we are a global trader already.","I hate this argument that says little Britain or something outside, or Britain is part of a wider Europe. We can both be within our trading relationships within Europe but we can also be a fantastic global trader.","We have to challenge the whole idea that it's acceptable for a society like Britain to have such a significant number of people who do not work one day of the week and don't have any possibility of improving the quality of their lives.","I think that the status that you have in life should be reflected in official documents. If you are married, fine, if you are living with someone, fine, if you are single, fine. We don't want to tell people how to live their lives.","What we want to do is reform the welfare system in the way that Tony Blair talked about 13 years ago but never achieved - a system that was created for the days after the Second World War. That prize is now I think achievable."],"Iain Glen":["As an actor, I'm familiar with having bursts of energy, where you're giving things a try, and then you have down time.","You're spoilt as an actor if you are in that small percentage that works regularly.","A bicycle has transformed my experience of London.","I'm not sure I'm the sort of actor people are hugely interested in finding out an awful lot about.","My first priority is to my wife, as hers is to me, and to our child.","I've been aware of the work I do as an actor being directorial in feel.","I'm happiest when I can just be a director and watch.","I'm too much of a big kid.","I don't know anyone who's suffered lung cancer.","You really are being quite foolish to smoke.","I don't crave Hollywood.","A big budget studio film is slower, they've got so much to create around you. Everything is more complicated.","With a woman of sophistication, class and modesty and refinement, I become a totally tongue-tied buffoon. I can't even look her straight in the face."],"Iain McGilchrist":["Over recent years, urbanisation, globalisation and the destruction of local cultures has led to a rise in the prevalence of mental illness in the developing world.","The human genome contains so much data that, it has been calculated, it would fill 43 volumes of Webster's International Dictionary.","The truth, it is said, is rarely pure or simple, yet genetics can at times seem seductively transparent.","Perspective in art has receded along with harmony in music: We tend more and more to see the world as a heap of intrinsically meaningless fragments.","The nature of creativity is to make space for things to happen... We can drive it out with our busyness and plans.","The imperial vastness of late Roman architecture was made possible by the invention of concrete.","To understand something, whether we are aware of it or not, depends on choosing a model. We get to understand what we see by comparing it with something else, something that we think we understand better. But what we compare it with turns out to have a huge influence on the outcome.","It is not rational to assume, without evidence, that rationality can disclose everything about the world, just because it can disclose some things. Our intuition in favour of rationality, where we are inclined to use it, is just that - an intuition. Reason is founded in intuition and ends in intuition, like a pair of massive bookends.","In Shakespeare, unique individuals repudiate the stereotypes demanded by the structure of the play: Shylock commands our sympathy, Barnardine refuses to be hanged. Individuals trump the category.","I trained in medicine after pursuing an academic career in the humanities, mainly because of my interest in the relationship between mind and body, and between mind and brain.","The genome was once thought to be just the blueprint for a living organism, like a combination of the architect's plan for a building and the builder's list of supplies. It specified the parts, the building blocks, and, somehow, the design of the whole, the way in which they are to be put together.","We have 26,000 genes. But a blind, millimetre-long roundworm with only 959 cells in total already has over 19,000.","Hunters and trackers learn not only to understand intellectually a bunch of facts about the animal they follow, but to feel their way into the very being of the animal.","Attention may sound dull, but it is an essential aspect of consciousness. In fact, it governs what it is that we turn out to be conscious of, and therefore plays a part in the coming into being of whatever exists for us.","The world appears rectilinear, but is in fact curvilinear - a literal truth in physics, and a metaphorical one in metaphysics.","Being uprooted from your own culture, provided you take with you the way of thinking and being that characterises the more integrated social culture from which you come, is not as disruptive to happiness and well-being as becoming part of a relatively fragmented culture."],"Iain Sinclair":["The world changes, but I want that change to be necessary or respectful of what has happened before. Everything changes, and that's quite right.","An involuntary return to the point of departure is, without doubt, the most disturbing of all journeys.","There is an obvious connection, on the declining Roman empire's bread and circuses model, between political enthusiasm for public spectacles and the periods when we are least able to pay for them.","If people are telling you a story about themselves, they gradually map their own local territories and know themselves by them.","I don't feel proprietary, but I do feel there is a human identity to the borough of Hackney that's quite peculiar. It was always bloody-minded and difficult; it always stood up to central government.","The kind of world I'm endlessly going on about is pretty well doomed, but nevertheless I think there are recesses of it worth celebrating.","The only times I'm not relaxed are when I haven't got a project on the go.","The negotiation of city space has been made more difficult with the idea that redevelopment is an improvement for some vague future - but it's never like that, is it? Once you get there, for economic reasons you have to generate the next project - so you're immediately starting to dig up something else, and so it goes on.","You can't impose a legacy.","To try to fix the future is a manifest absurdity.","If the landscape changes, then I don't know who I am either. The landscape is a refracted autobiography. As it disappears you lose your sense of self.","I am crumbling in sync with old Hackney.","What I write, I write. I'll always do it in some form.","Hackney at certain epochs has given itself suburban airs and graces, before being slapped down and consigned once more to the dump bin of aborted ambition.","With the world as it now presents itself, there is something perverse, and probably dysfunctional, about a person who stays in the same house for 40 years. What about the expanding family syndrome, the school-lottery migration, the property portfolio neurosis? Have you no imagination?","You can't leave the thing that you are, the house that has become your biography."],"Ian Allison":["Sea ice conditions have remained stable in Antarctica generally.","Ice shelves in general have episodic carvings and there can be large icebergs breaking off - I'm talking 100km or 200km long - every 10 or 20 or 50 years."],"Ian Anderson":["Seek that which within lies waiting to begin the fight of your life that is everyday.","It's only the giving that makes you what you are.","'Aqualung' marks the point at which I had the confidence as a songwriter and as a guitar player to actually pick up and play the guitar and be at the forefront of the band. It's also the album on which I began to address religious issues in my music, and I think that happened simply because the time was right for it.","The flute was an alternative to being a small fish in an increasingly bigger pool filled with a number of great guitar players.","When I was a teenager, I really didn't like loud rock music. I listened to jazz and blues and folk music. I've always preferred acoustic music. And it was only, I suppose, by the time Jethro Tull was getting underway that we did let the music begin to have a harder edge, in particular with the electric guitar being alongside the flute.","As a musician, life is not over just because you are getting older, and so I find retirement a very frightening and dark thought.","I can never make up my mind if I'm happy being a flute player, or if I wish I were Eric Clapton.","I was always more interested in the ultimate live performance rather than the recording for its own sake. And, for the audience too, that thrill of - just being there.","I was not a great guitarist, so I sold my 1960 Fender Stratocaster in exchange for a Shure Microphone, made in Chicago, and a flute.","I make up my own mind in light of available facts, with my own experience and a sense of personal ethics.","Most people, from their second album on, find it much harder to be as spontaneously creative as they were with their first couple of records, and some people only have one thing that they do.","In writing lyrics - well, for me, anyway - it's about getting into character, you know? 'Who is writing this?' In the case of the original 'Thick As A Brick,' supposedly a precocious, very young child who's fantasizing about his future and the context of all the confusing elements to which school boys are subjected at that time.","A lot of pop music is about stealing pocket money from children.","If Jesus Christ came back today, He and I would get into our brown corduroys and go to the nearest jean store and overturn the racks of blue denim.","Just once I would like to persuade the audience not to wear any article of blue denim. If only they could see themselves in a pair of brown corduroys like mine instead of this awful, boring blue denim.","I'm very much an observer and a conduit of thoughts and ideas.","I think it's really the job of the composer, the artist, the painter, the writer to present people with options. I'm just really reflecting the thoughts and actions around me.","I think we always view people who make us feel uncomfortable and appear to intrude on our middle-class cozy space, we view them with, if not hostility, at least suspicion, discomfort, embarrassment.","I've always been fond of acoustic music.","I suppose when I started playing guitar, it was the means to an end. I never thought of myself as a fully fledged guitar instrumentalist. And my early excursions on the electric guitar were curtailed when Eric Clapton came on the scene, and I decided I was never going to be in the same arena as a Clapton or a Peter Green.","As a songwriter, you tend to develop your own style, your own technique, based around what it is you're trying to write and perform, in terms of your own music. So a way of evolving a guitar style as a songwriter is much easier, I think, than developing a true style of your own just from listening to music or playing other people's music.","I've always felt that some of my best lyrics are less than three minutes long, and it's great when you can do that - be succinct and get the message across in a simple, clear idea.","There's always going to be a little bit of autobiographical content to everything. It's how you lend some authority to what you write - you give it that weight by drawing on your direct experiences and indirect experiences from people that you know well, or a little.","Prog didn't really go away. Just took a catnap in the late Seventies. A new generation of fans discovered it, and a whole new array of bands and solo artists took it on into the new millennium.","Touring is what you make it. I like to organise as much as possible myself.","Our politicians may fail us, but Status Quo always delivers on the promise.","All the time I was playing the flute, the lines, the solos, the riffs, the construction, were based on my guitar skills. I did not play the flute to exploit its natural faculties, but I used it as a surrogate guitar.","I don't think people really do listen. We plug into music, and we have short attention spans. We tend to download individual tracks from iTunes rather than a whole album. We buy music DVDs and watch them once, and then they disappear into a drawer, or we loan them to a friend, and we never watch it again.","I think the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, first of all, has got to be put into the context of being an American cultural showcase. It's there to be a museum showcase of all that's great about American music.","The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame traditionally has had a management style that is very supportive of American talent, first and foremost, over everything else. And I think that's right and proper.","It's nice to be recognized, but it's not great to have it too conspicuously recognized, if you see what I mean. Gold records on the wall, or titles after your name, it's just not something... I don't feel that great about it.","Classical music only really came into my life in 1969. I wish I had heard classical music and church music when I was a teenager or even as a child.","When I was a young boy, I preferred cats to dogs. From the age of seven or eight onwards I just felt more comfortable with cats. And I felt more comfortable with girls, I didn't really like hanging out with guys. When I was about ten or eleven, I was friendlier with the girls in my school than with the guys.","I'm all in favor of banks that play their part in community endeavors, private individuals looking for loans, people who want to start up a little business, and that's what banks are for.","I think I've owned all the models of iPods so far. And these days between my iPod, iPhone and my personal laptop computer, I'm someone who is very, very grateful for all the ways to listen to music and completely switch off from people around me and listen to the music in detail, which is very hard to do if you're in a room with other people.","We do hear perhaps too many accolades generally aimed at people like Steve Jobs. We have to remember that there are other classic things in life that we undervalue and take them for granted. If you think of the classic lines of the modern jet aircraft, it's really been there since early World War II.","When I was in my teenage years, I went to sign up as a cadet entrant to the police force but was at the very last moment rejected, just as I was about to sign my name on the dotted line. I won't get into why that happened, but it was a moment where it could've been predetermined then that I was off to become a policeman.","I was quite keen on silviculture, the growing of trees, and that was something I gave a lot of thought to. Maybe I could've gone in that direction. But it just so happened that while I was trying to make up my mind, I enrolled in art school, and there I began to develop my interest in music, parallel with my interest in the visual arts.","I kind of like the idea of living a rather ordinary life as a shopkeeper, and I examine that possibility as one of the outcomes of the young Gerald Bostock growing older.","I feel the audience has a right to know if some of the money they're spending is going to a certain cause, and reassuring them the money is going to where it's supposed to be going.","I'm really terrible with small children; they're small, noisy, irritating, damp and soggy.","In most cases, my favorite Jethro Tull songs will be determined by how I feel about them as live performance songs, not by the recorded identity.","Not to be mean about it, but some great rock and rollers, like Bo Diddley and Chuck Berry, are pretty one-dimensional.","There seems to be an inclination among rock musicians to be very carefree with money, but I negotiate the best flight and hotel deals on our tours to maximise the band's income - I don't want too see too much taken off the top line.","I'm not one for Sudoku or crosswords - the thing that fires my little brain is doing tour budgets.","It was instilled in me that the money I was given was not to be lost or spent on any other purpose.","Writing lyrics is part spontaneous, intuitive and part really thought through and carefully analyzed as you write it. It's a mixture of two approaches, and I imagine writing anything is like that, really. Some of it just flows, and you just go with it.","If you're gonna use simile, analogy, metaphor, be descriptive and have some flowery adjectives and a few odd nouns and some engaging bits of dialogue or sentiment, then you're sort of writing a novel, really. But rock lyrics are not really known for their sophistication.","I don't really set out to please anybody, and I don't think I ever have. I have occasionally been encouraged to try to write something specifically for the purpose of releasing it as a single to get radio play. Those are not my best songs, as a rule.","I'm very motivated by the occasional creative payoff that comes when something goes really well, be it a song, a recording or performance. The payoff is enormous - when you get it. Most of the time, though, I'm filled with self-loathing and general frustration at the limitations I have as a musician.","I don't think successful musicians were really put on this planet in order to have a great time, pat themselves on the back and say, 'Oh, what a clever boy I am!' I think that, like most artists, we were put on the planet to suffer just a little. And we do.","Most of what I've written songs about are things that come out of the confusing emotional, spiritual and psychological period of time when you're going through puberty."],"Ian Anthony Dale":["There was a time when I was offered two episodes of 'Alias,' that show with Jennifer Garner which J.J. Abrams did back before he became the mega producer and super successful director. I instead decided I wanted to play this family guy on a short-lived UPN 'Second Time Around.' It starred Boris Kodjoe and Nicole Ari Parker.","I am quite handy; not to sound bragadocious, but I've been working with wood and building things my entire life. I used to be a skateboarder and built ramps with my father. Then, the first two years I lived in Los Angeles, I worked as a carpenter building sets.","I was one of the only people of color at my grade school and also my high school. It's weird recollecting on my childhood, I think, because my brothers are all white. We all share the same father but different mothers. I guess I kind of associated white, but I was occasionally reminded in a really negative way that I wasn't.","Moving to Los Angeles and working in places like Hawaii, you get to experience a true melting pot. It's really nice to be around people who are multiethnic.","Shadowing is really a great way to learn how the entire TV-making mechanism works. I had the distinct pleasure of shadowing the gifted and talented Allison Anders, who taught me a great deal about the importance of collaboration and trusting the talent around you.","Whether we're stuffing our faces with Kogi tacos or playing a pickup game of football outside the stages, there's never a shortage of fun behind the scenes on 'Murder In The First.'","'Murder in the First' takes 12 episodes to explore the crime and the issues surrounding it, all in the hopes of answering the question, 'How did we get to this point?'","So many good fortunes have come my way, and I'm trying to pay it forward by helping to raise money to complete 'Bulbul: Song Of The Nightingale,' a documentary that brings attention to the social and human injustices suffered by the Banchara tribe in India.","We all go to the theater and cinema to be inspired and moved on an emotional level, sometimes to laughter, sometimes to tears. Once I discovered that acting could have such an effect, I was sold. It has been one of the most rewarding discoveries I have ever made.","A lot of the time, a moral compass is all that separates a hero from being a villain; otherwise, the two are very much the same. Both are generally the richest and most complex characters, and they get to have all the fun. I guess it's those types of roles that I ultimately gravitate towards.","Hollywood can be a really tough environment for anyone trying to make a living. Unfortunately for actors of color, namely Asian Americans, opportunities have been and remain substantially limited. One place this is not the case is on 'Hawaii Five-0,' where we have three Asian American series regulars and a landscape rich with diversity.","As an Asian-American actor, I believe it is important to never settle for the status quo. I feel a responsibility to do everything in my power to create positive perceptions of Asian Americans through my work.","I've been playing both sides of the law my entire career. It's not really surprising for me to be doing opposing sides simultaneously. I would argue that even though my character on 'Hawaii Five-0' originated on the wrong side of the law, I'd say he's worked his way over to the good side.","One of my favorite experiences in my career, certainly one of the most interesting characters I've ever played, was Simon Lee on 'The Event.' That was a show I was quite proud of and a character I really enjoyed playing. It was one of the most three-dimensional characters that was ever written for me and that I'd ever gotten to play."],"Ian Axel":["I started writing songs when I was real young, when I was 3 years old. The piano spoke to me - I don't remember when I wasn't playing piano. My second grade talent show was the first time I performed my own thing. I dressed up as Dracula and played a song called 'Monster Rock' that I wrote. And I won.","When you're listening to the radio, you're hearing dance beats, all the bells and whistles, and 'Say Something' makes you quiet and forces you to listen.","There are people we look up to, like Lady Gaga and what she's built. She's not afraid to own who she is.","I'm a big fan of piano-based rock music like Elton John, Ben Folds, and even Queen.","I feel that when Chad is in the room, I can tap into this other thing where music comes from. I don't know. It's just this really magical, special connection and relationship.","We met because Chad was in one of my classes, and I was looking for someone to write music with. I knew that he wrote his own music, and he seemed nice, so I found out he was going to be in a practice room, practicing his trumpet. He'd already said he was too busy to hang out or hear any new people or work on any music, so I stalked him.","It's different for every song. But for 'Say Something,' I think it was Chad who had an idea on guitar, and I had an idea on piano for different songs, and we just married them together. We bounce things off each other constantly and kind of massage all these ideas into a three and a half minute pop song.","We never thought 'Say Something' would be a holiday song. I'm still surprised that it's resonating at this time of year. Maybe that's why it's working so well - it balances out all the joy.","Producers on Broadway approached us with an original script after relaunching ourselves as 'A Great Big World,' and wanted us to write the music. They asked us to make the music we would sing if we could, and so we can go a little crazier. We refer to it as 'our music on steroids.'"],"Ian Beattie":["When you're a child, it's easy to see school as the worst thing in the world. It's only later in life you realise what a wonderful time it was. Looking back, I can't believe I even wanted to leave.","If Northern Ireland had better weather, it would be like New Zealand. It's an immensely beautiful country.","I might bump into them because I live in Belfast, and Belfast is not that big a place. You go for a walk, and you walk past Kit Harington. You go for a meal, and there's Peter Dinklage.","As an actor myself, I know we go where the work is, but I think it's sad the Lyric haven't found any homegrown talent.","When I was little, one of my father's friends owned a circus. For four absolutely incredible summers, I found myself being the only boy in Ireland who didn't dream of running away with the circus. I was in it!","When I retired from the circus at the grand old age of 11, my parents thought it would be best to focus more on the challenges ahead, and so I started at Methodist College Belfast."],"Ian Botham":["To me, it doesn't matter how good you are. Sport is all about playing and competing. Whatever you do in cricket and in sport, enjoy it, be positive and try to win.","Soccer and cricket were my main sports growing up. I had trials as a soccer player with a few clubs interested, Crystal Palace being one, but it was cricket which became my chosen profession.","You will attract the younger generation and they might well prove tougher than the older generation. What we are trying to do is to look at the future and see what we can do to bring some stability back to people's lives.","I'm not a great one for looking back.","Retiring for good wasn't difficult. I knew at the time it was right. I was no longer capable of achieving the standards I'd set myself and there was no light at the end of the tunnel.","I watched children dying. That will be the image that will stay with me.","What's happened has happened, so what can we do to make it better for tomorrow and the day after? That's why we're here.","The resilience of these people is amazing. I am a great believer that the sooner we get things up and running in terms of sport in this area, the better.","There will be no politics, no ifs and buts; if we see something and feel that work needs to be done, we will get people here we can rely on and ensure it is done in the same thorough way as our other projects.","I half knew what to expect when I saw the cricket ground in the morning. It was when I started to talk to people working out there, I began to find what I was looking for.","The people in the villages had turned in on themselves. You can understand it. When you have a bad day on the field, what do you do? Talk to your teammates.","Sport can bring communities together and can release a lot of pent-up emotions.","If you can change three lives in 10, three lives in a hundred, that's got to be good, hasn't it?","I think we are going to see exciting cricket all the way. We are watching the two best teams in the world-and I think England will eventually go on to pip Australia by a single Test.","I can remember running around at the age of 3, wanting to play golf, cricket and football. I was always active, one way or another, driving my parents mad.","To win in Australia, for me, has to be the ultimate success because the Aussies live for sport.","I think I'd struggle to get excited by synchronised swimming.","There is nothing more exciting in sport when the top two countries in the world are battling for the Ashes.","Genghis Khan was a fascinating man and way ahead of his time.","Winston Churchill would be great to have around the table."],"Ian Brown":["'Psychedelic' means mind-expanding.","I've never chatted up a girl in me life. I've always let girls come to me. I've never approached a girl to chat her up.","When I was 9, I was into T. Rex, Gary Glitter, and Alice Cooper. I knew The Beatles because my nan introduced me to them, but T. Rex was the first band I got into myself. I got 'Metal Guru' a few months after hearing 'Children of the Revolution' in Pwllheli in North Wales at a market.","Getting a grey beard's not cool.","If you want to call me a Karaoke King, I'll take it.","One person might perceive me as godlike, and the next might think I'm a northern thug. I don't think I've done myself any favours... but I swear I've not had a proper fight since I was 14.","Everybody is a star. It's true. And if you've got a light, don't let it go out. 'Cos some people sink under.","I give thanks for everything that's ever happened to me and for everything I've got.","I liked him, that Jarvis Cocker. I like the fact he was androgynous, he could appeal to everybody. He wasn't just a lad pretending to be a thug.","I'm solo, and I love being solo. I believe I went through the Roses so I could become a solo music-maker. That's what I believe.","When you live in Manchester and it's raining every day, you've got to imagine the sun sometimes. When you're brought up in concrete, you aim for the green leaves. And when you get to the green leaves, you yearn again for concrete.","You'll never find a Manchester band slagging off another Manchester band, but within each Manchester band, people will rip each other apart: Mondays, Smiths, New Order, Roses, Oasis.","I love harmonicas - old blues players like Sonny Boy Williamson.","We're against hypocrisy, lies, bigotry, show business, insincerity, phonies, and fakers.","If I was in the gutter, and my kids lived on the kerb, I'd go and get a job in B&Q before I'd reform the Roses. I gave everything I had to the Stone Roses and ended up hitting a brick wall. I'm never going to give anyone a foothold on that wall again.","I went into jail with absolutely no respect whatsoever for authority, and I came out with even less.","Belief outweighs talent. Self-belief's got me everything, self-belief.","People tend to settle for the fiver rather than going for the pot of gold.","Hell is being stuck in a lift with Elton John and the Queen Mother.","I feel like the Ryan Giggs of music.","We're all anti-royalist, anti-patriarch. Cos it's 1989. Time to get real.","When the ravens leave the Tower, England shall fall, they say. We want to be there shooting the ravens.","When The Stone Roses first came out, the early reviews called me 'simian.' I had to look that up at the time.","I am gentle. I think nearly everyone who makes music is sensitive - I don't care how hard they pretend they are.","I thought it would be more interesting to make a musical autobiography than an actual autobiography.","Just because I'm a successful singer who's loved and has been loved for years doesn't mean I'm sitting behind electric gates in my own fantasy land.","I don't actually personally get off on guitar music.","I like a lot of that Chicago stuff, house music.","It's a horrible name, Coldplay. It doesn't conjure up any positive thoughts.","I love karaoke - I usually do Blondie's 'Heart Of Glass,' or 'Try A Little Tenderness.'","I went to a friend's 40th in Manchester, and there was a karaoke machine, and no one was having a go. My mate said, 'No one's singing because you're in the room.' I said, 'Who am I, Frank Sinatra?' They made me sing flipping 'My Star' to a backing track that sounded like '80s Roxy Music. It was pretty embarrassing, but I did it.","I'd like to write songs for other people, see things from a different perspective. I'd like to watch things from the dugout instead of the pitch.","Putting another human being above yourself isn't healthy. I think it's capitalistic.","Stardom's transitory. Nothing really changes except people's attitudes.","The Beatles were great; we know that. But we were trying to do a new thing. Why do we need to recreate the Sixties?","I love people, me, I believe in people. I love people too much.","My biggest fault is that I give people too much credit. Then they let you down. I'm 99.9 per cent perfect - that's how I look at myself and, therefore, everybody else too.","I used to be one of those kids who couldn't keep my mouth shut.","Oasis are okay, but they're like The Sun: base.","I started managing myself in October 2004, and since then, it's gone up and up.","My sister bought me the Koran in 1990. I always thought the stories in it were magical.","I've always said prayers.","I see The Stone Roses in '89 as Technicolor: we were all about joy and possibilities of life.","They've had a hard life, the Oasis brothers. They've done really well to be semi-normal. It's always sad when your dirty linen is brought out in public.","I was skint, and I had to move back to my mum and dad's house, back into the room I shared with my brother when I was a kid. I kept getting people on the streets telling me that they loved me; it didn't mean anything to me because I was still borrowing tenners off my pensioner father to go and get some chicken.","Some of the kids who discovered me from my 'F.E.A.R.' record or one of the U.N.K.L.E. tunes have said, 'I don't even like the Roses; I love your solo stuff.' I buzz off that.","I'd love to see the world without liquor for a week.","People in Russia learned English off the Beatles. People in Japan learned English off the Stone Roses. Noel Gallagher says music can't change the world, but the Roses made him want to start a group, so it changed his world.","I can't think of anyone who's reformed for art's sake. That's why the Roses will never reform.","In March 1977, I taped the single 'Career Opportunities' off Piccadilly Radio, which was the '70s equivalent of downloading, and then the album came out in April 1977.","I was really into punk when I was about 14.","The Roses should have made it as the biggest band since The Beatles, but we didn't.","I wasn't on stage to be worshipped or for people to look up to me. I was with the crowd.","We started out to finish groups like U2 - that was what it was all about.","Even me mum can't tell me what to do.","I spent the summer of '88 indoors, writing 'Shoot You Down,' 'Bye Bye Badman,' and 'Don't Stop.'","You're never alone on the dole in Manchester.","The jails are full of kids from kids' homes. You're 16 years old, and you're out on the street. How you going to fend for yourself at 16 if you've not had an education? You're going to turn to crime.","People want to adulate people.","I was jailed for using words that I still dispute. Anyone who's ever met me will tell you that I'm not a violent person.","I'm lucky enough to be one of them music makers who can do a dance festie or a rock festie.","I don't like to play anywhere with a banner for Carlsberg or vodka or whatever. I'm not a drinker myself, and I don't like feeling like I'm working for the liquor companies.","I started doing karate when I was 11.","I gave it up three weeks before my black belt, foolishly. I got to my third brown belt and must have trained for 18 months but never went for it. I was nearly 18 and got this thing in my head about, ' Who are they to grade me?' Trying to be a rebel when I should have done it. It's my only regret, not going for a black belt.","At primary school, I thought I was George Best. Then I got to secondary school, and it was more serious.","We should be growing carrots up the side of the Empire State Building or Big Ben.","We need to ban all air-freighted food. Carrots from Holland. Potatoes from Egypt. It's got to stop.","Permacultures - where you use the immediate environment to grow food - should be mandatory.","People have to realise you don't help African children singing along to 60-year-old men playing their tunes from 40 years ago.","I'm only really good at making music. I wasn't convinced when I started out, but then I heard the first Stone Roses' LP.","I'd like to change the world. Eradicate poverty, racism, and sexism... all the usual things.","Everything I've ever achieved, I've done on my terms.","Honestly, going solo is the second best thing that's ever happened to me after my kids.","You're never going to improve on a Michael Jackson song if you cover it.","It is a fact that everyone's got a limited run in music - but who's to say how long that run lasts? I used to think that there would be no way I'd still be in music when I was 40. I used to think anyone who was 40 was an old man, and they probably shouldn't be doing it anymore.","I feel like I've established myself as a music maker in my own right.","Maybe if you see me begging on the streets, you might find me doing The Stone Roses the next day.","I'd never been paid for the first Roses LP - it was 2002 before we received any royalties.","My wife is Mexican, and she's really influenced me: She's got an impressive collection of Mexican music.","Every time I do interviews, they ask me about the same things - poverty, war, and the power of the church.","Northern soul was huge in Manchester in the '70s and '80s; I went to a lot of all-nighters.","We wrote 'Stellify' for Rihanna, but as we got to the end of writing it, I thought, 'You know what? I'm gonna keep this for myself. We'll give her another one.' She'd have probably sung it better, but it is too good for me not to do it.","I've not thought about the Stone Roses since we quit. How many LPs do I have to make to stop people talking about it?","With the Stone Roses, I always thought we'd be successful because we had some great songs.","I always loved Oasis because when they came out, they did express that they loved us, and they saw that we did it, and they thought they could do it, too.","I actually was able to give up shopping in February '99.","One thing I've always loved and rated me dad for is that, because of him, I've never seen the Queen's Christmas speech.","By 1993, the Stone Roses had become this huge, beautiful cruise ship just floating about in the middle of nowhere with no captain.","We're the most important group in the world.","Even on songs we've got that are about a girl, there's always something there that's a call to insurrection.","We feel we're the only British group worth exporting since the Sex Pistols, definitely.","I never wanted to be a pop singer, but I always watched pop programs and knew I could do better than the people I was seeing.","I like the fact that a group can become successful, and by way of what you are, you can show up all the other people who are around you.","We believe that anyone can do anything, and everyone's a star. And that's evident from the shows we do. It just feels like a whole bunch of people in a room celebrating something - maybe just being alive.","With the Roses, I knew we were great; I felt that we would achieve something. On my own, I had no idea.","I wrote a lot of lyrics in prison, but they'd all be like, 'Crawls upon the shoulders, hatred in the eyes.' I wrote about 50 songs in there that were all about jail. I've come out and thought, 'I've only served eight weeks; I can't really write a concept album about jail.'","Since we were kids, we grow up believing that astronauts are heroes - that to go up in a rocket is a heroic thing. These guys are bigger than movie stars. To me, it's... all a well-dressed-up lie, basically. There's billions spent on rockets up there, and there's millions starving down here. It don't make sense to me.","I feel like the Roses were a great group, but I never wanted to try to do it again. I knew I couldn't get a band that would compare to the Roses, that would have an impact like the Roses.","I've got six solo albums. I've been round the world three times. I don't even think about the Roses.","England's a small nation, and the pop music industry is built on fashion."],"Ian Caldwell":["The Bible never tells us what Jesus looked like, and in the earliest surviving paintings of him, he is sometimes depicted as short-haired, sometimes as beardless, with no authoritative version winning out over the others. Yet around 400 A.D., all of the other competing images were replaced by the long-haired, bearded Jesus we know today.","'The Fifth Gospel' is set entirely inside the Vatican and told from the perspective of a Catholic priest. I'm not Catholic myself, yet authenticity and factual accuracy are very important to me, so the novel required an enormous amount of research.","I write about modern people who share a deep sense of connection to the mysteries of the past. I find that I understand myself and my world better when I'm able to peer into history as a mirror.","The Vatican has to strike a difficult balance between running a country and running a religious institution."],"Ian Doescher":["In many ways, 'William Shakespeare's Star Wars' is modeled on Shakespeare's Henry V, which relied on a chorus to explain in words the battles of Harfleur and Agincourt that could never be captured on the Elizabethan stage.","The hardest part of writing 'William Shakespeare's Star Wars' was probably the sheer amount of iambic pentameter and tiptoeing around certain scenes I knew would be hot-button issues for 'Star Wars' fans.","I had great English teachers in high school who first piqued my interest in Shakespeare. Each year, we read a different play - 'Othello,' 'Julius Caesar,' 'Macbeth,' 'Hamlet' - and I was the nerd in class who would memorize soliloquies just for the fun of it.","I've spent so much time with iambic pentameter that I can now recognize it when I hear it in conversation or a movie - it's like a weird, useless superpower.","The Ewoks were definitely a challenge of writing 'The Jedi Doth Return.' After having done so many things with characters who don't speak English, how was I going to make them stand out? Jedi is also rich with emotional material, particularly Darth Vader's transformation from the dark side back to the good.","I always wanted Han Solo's confidence and swagger. My personality is way more C-3PO, but Han was always who I wanted to be.","I grew up with the 'Star Wars' movies since before I have many memories. We had them on VHS back in the day, so they were part of the fabric of growing up in my family.","People ask me whether I see 'Star Wars' as a comedy or a tragedy, but it's really neither - it's partly a history, like 'Henry V,' and partly a fantasy, like 'The Tempest.'","Writing 'William Shakespeare's Star Wars' was a fun exercise in mixing just the right amount of the Bard with just the right amount of everyone's favorite galaxy far, far away.","In writing 'William Shakespeare's Star Wars,' I had the freedom to go beyond the original script and add asides, soliloquys and even new scenes. The main characters all get a soliloquy or two - or in Luke's case, several.","Visually speaking, nothing calls Shakespeare to mind like Hamlet holding Yorick's skull."],"Ian Dunbar":["Training a puppy is like raising a child. Every single interaction is a training opportunity.","You don't train a dog in a training hall, jerking his neck or even giving him food treats. You train him using life rewards.","All training is negotiation, whether you're training dogs or spouses.","Learning from wolves to interact with pet dogs makes about as much sense as, 'I want to improve my parenting - let's see how the chimps do it!'","When I'm training a dog, I develop a relationship with that dog. He's my buddy, and I want to make training fun.","Training a dog, to me, is on a par with learning to dance with my wife or teaching my son to ski. These are fun things we do together. If anyone even talks about dominating the dog or hurting him or fighting him or punishing him, don't go there.","I grew up on a farm and my grandfather quit school when he was 12, but when it came to common sense and animals, he was the smartest person I've ever met, before or since. He taught me that to touch an animal is an earned privilege. It's not a right.","With every animal, you have to build its confidence around people because people do some crazy and stupid things.","You can instill fear in your kids and get them to mind, but they won't function better in the world and your relationship will suffer greatly.","People - and dogs - are dying to be trained."],"Ian Dury":["Sex and drugs and rock and roll.","I haven't shaken my fists at the moon."],"Ian Fleming":["Never say 'no' to adventures. Always say 'yes', otherwise you'll lead a very dull life.","Once is happenstance. Twice is coincidence. Three times is enemy action.","If I wait for the genius to come, it just doesn't arrive.","You only live twice. Once when you are born and once when you look death in the face.","Older women are best, because they always think they may be doing it for the last time.","Writing about 2,000 words in three hours every morning, 'Casino Royale' dutifully produced itself. I wrote nothing and made no corrections until the book was finished. If I had looked back at what I had written the day before I might have despaired.","One of the bibles of my youth was 'Birds of the West Indies,' by James Bond, a well-known ornithologist, and when I was casting about for a name for my protagonist I thought, 'My God, that's the dullest name I've ever heard,' so I appropriated it. Now the dullest name in the world has become an exciting one.","Most marriages don't add two people together. They subtract one from the other.","People do connect me with James Bond simply because I happen to like scrambled eggs and short-sleeved shirts and some of the things that James Bond does, but I certainly haven't got his guts nor his very lively appetites.","I don't regard James Bond precisely as a hero, but at least he does get on and do his duty, in an extremely corny way.","A horse is dangerous at both ends and uncomfortable in the middle.","I was just on the edge of getting married, and I was frenzied at the prospect of this great step in my life after having been a bachelor for so long. And I really wanted to take my mind off of the agony, and so I decided to sit down and write a book.","As a result of 50 years of emancipation, feminine qualities were dying out or being transferred to the males. Pansies of both sexes were everywhere, not yet completely homosexual, but confused not knowing what they were. The result was a herd of unhappy sexual misfits... the women wanting to dominate and the men to be nannied.","Bond reflected that good Americans were fine people and that most of them seemed to come from Texas.","This country-right-or-wrong business is getting a little out-of-date.. History is moving pretty quickly these days and the heroes and villains keep on changing parts.","Men want a woman whom they can turn on and off like a light switch.","As for sex, well, I mean sex is a perfectly respectable subject as far as Shakespeare is concerned. I mean, all history is love and violence.","I shall not waste my days in trying to prolong them.","A woman should be an illusion.","I'm not in the Shakespeare stakes. I have no ambition.","It was the short men that caused all the trouble in the world."],"Ian Frazier":["I'm one of those people who happen to like trees. I don't know why - I just do. As a kid, I loved to climb them. The distant, upper branches, especially, were celestial and alluring.","I don't want to collect Indian art, though pots and beadwork and blankets made by Indians remain the most beautiful art objects in the American West, in my opinion.","There's an idea of the Plains as the middle of nowhere, something to be contemptuous of. But it's really a heroic place.","You can find dozens of books about people taking the Trans-Siberian Railroad. I knew I had to do something different to cross Siberia. To drive and to talk with people along the way, that was how I wrote my book 'Great Plains'. I drove and camped in Siberia, but did not have a real program.","Once, America's size in the imagination was limitless. After Europeans settled and changed it, working from the coasts inland, its size in the imagination shrank.","Siberia is a state of mind.","Everything in Russia is made of cement - phone booths, fence posts and light bulbs.","I'd read books in Russian, and they would take me forever. I wanted to write a book that would last and would not be superficial. Siberian-travel writing is its own genre.","I was friends with Russians who said I should see Russia. I went there in '93 and it was so exciting, and I went to Siberia and had a great time.","I only saw one English-speaking person all the way across Siberia.","Russian humor is to adapt or make some sense or nonsense out of the insanity of their lives.","People in Russia adapt to misery by a deep, deep humor.","When the days start to get shorter, I want to be in some nice brick building on the East Coast with the lights glowing in the windows. When the daylight starts changing, I want to be out West.","America to me is so varied and exciting. I always feel nostalgia for the place I'm not in, and then I get there and find myself in a traffic jam going into the Lincoln Tunnel, and I think, 'God, why was I romanticizing this part of the country?' I think it has to do with the romantic, unrealistic temperament.","I would hate to see the idea of freedom disappear, and I wonder if maybe it will.","I don't have a disregard for my reader in humor pieces.","Leading economists have shown that by shrinking Texas, we can actually create more income for Texas in the long run.","Despite the obvious benefits, many Americans do not like Texas. Some even say they despise Texas, and make no secret of their feelings.","America can enjoy a vital, fully functioning government, with all the benefits provided by Texas, while reducing Texas at the same time.","Words are charms. It's like a song you didn't even know you knew.","I believe that when Crazy Horse was killed, something more than a man's life was snuffed out.","I suppose anybody just losing it and sputtering curses is pretty funny. But I think it would be more of a challenge, much more of a challenge, to make a cursing dad funny.","I think what is important for things to be funny is if you the listener, or the reader, get a chance to supply the humor of it yourself.","I don't want to participate in traditional Indian religious ceremonies - dance in a sun dance or pray in a sweat lodge or go on a vision quest with the help of a medicine man. The power of these ceremonies has an appeal, but I'm content with what little religion I already have.","I think Indians dress better than anyone, but I don't want to imitate more than a detail or two; I prefer my clothes humdrum and inconspicuous, and a cowboy hat just doesn't work for me.","When I go to Indian reservations in the West, and especially to the Pine Ridge Reservation, I sometimes feel unsure where to put my foot when I open the car door. The very ground is different from where I usually stand. There are fewer curbs, fewer sidewalks, and almost no street signs, mailboxes, or leashed dogs.","Russia has always had a global history. Global history is a bummer. You suffer invasions of all different kinds. And Russia was not defended against them.","Human connection is the way things work. It's like a patronage system. You know somebody, and he knows somebody, and he knows somebody, and he knows the district governor, and it's okay.","Russians don't complain, usually.","When I needed to think or was really upset, generally I climbed a tree.","To me, a bag in a tree is like a flag of chaos, and when I remove it, I'm capturing the flag of the other side. In the end, it doesn't matter how ironic or serious or even effective on a larger scale bag snagging may be.","With reporting, if you work hard, you can usually pull something out. But writing humor doesn't respond to working hard, necessarily. I mean, you could just sit there and look at the page all day and maybe something will come.","Writing humor for me is more like a watchful-ness. You have to watch. When you say something funny, or someone else does, it's more like you wait for the piece.","On two or three book tours, I have visited bookstores in the Mall of America and signed copies of my books and introduced myself to store employees who I hope will sell them.","I am an author, and like many in my profession, I am also a traveling salesman, going all over in an attempt to persuade people to spend twenty-five dollars on a hardcover book by me.","A book tour is not a good opportunity to let your mind wander. You have to pay attention, remember salespeople's and interviewers' names, succinctly summarize your book in a 'selling' way, and so on."],"Ian Goldin":["People often focus on the downsides of population growth but neglect the upsides. These upsides may even outweigh the downsides, making a larger population a good thing overall.","Global actions require local and national participation. International cooperation and action requires community perspectives and legitimacy if it is to be effective.","In many cases, water stress is more about politics, economics, behaviour and governance than absolute water scarcity. Better planning is needed, to allocate water where societal need is greatest, and to allow trade-offs between alternative uses.","Nations are divided, but we citizens need not be.","We need to find a way to empower citizens to make governments take notice.","I've always been torn between the pure and the social sciences.","Human activity is having a major impact on the planet. We consume or have diverted a large proportion of the productivity of the land and oceans. Our hunger for land crowds out fellow species. Our waste products pollute the waters, warm the atmosphere and acidify the oceans."],"Ian Gomez":["Once you lose that fear, good stuff can happen because you're not in your head about whether it will suck. Once you don't care and accept that it probably will suck, then it probably won't suck.","As a child, one of my defense mechanisms was to try to be funny. My mom tried to nurture that by putting me in acting class. But I got bored when we stopped pretending to be trees and actually had to work.","My stepfather had a connection with The Second City and told me I should go there. I woke up in a cold sweat one night and said, 'I'm moving to Chicago.' That's how I went to Second City.","I met my wife, Nia Vardalos, at The Second City, and she was chomping at the bit to move to L.A.","We come from Second City where you're taught if you make your fellow stage partner look good, that makes you look good.","I remember I got an ALMA award for an actor being on three shows simultaneously.","Scott Foley was always fun because he's a very funny guy. So I liked working with him a bunch.","I have a speech impediment because I slur a lot, and they even make fun of me on 'Cougar Town' because there's certain word combinations that I just can't say.","My mom's family is Russian Jewish, and my dad's Puerto Rico Catholic, so it's kind of a weird mix.","When I got out of high school, I was working in restaurants in New York City, when I heard Bill Anderson from The Neighborhood Playhouse was doing private lessons. I started taking classes, and it was a lot of improv and Meisner and repetition.","I met my wife, Nia Vardalos, at The Second City, and she was chomping at the bit to move to L.A. I was afraid of having to start all over again, which happened. But we got lucky.","It's funny because 'Felicity' didn't have a huge following, but the following it did have is hugely devoted, so people who are fanatics about 'Felicity' would run up to me all the time. I'd be at a bar, and someone will go, 'Hey, were you on Felicity? ...' I loved doing the show.","People come up and say, 'Hey, I know you!' They're middle-aged women and big burly guys. They say, 'Don't tell anyone, but I watch Felicity, and I think it's great.'"],"Ian Hacking":["Many of us will be obsessed with one or another kind of secret or revelation, be it gossip about friends or ourselves, a fantasy about spies, or a worry about the most personal information now stored in data banks. But few of us think about secrets in general, or about the moral rights and wrongs of hiding or exposing them.","The social risks that worry us are not a random bundle of frights.","Every moral teacher or spiritual adviser gives injunctions about how to live wisely and well. But life is so complicated and full of uncertainty that rules seldom tell us quite what to do.","Life on a factory farm is well-nigh unbearable for the animals or birds, and it is often foul for the women and men who process the meat that results - especially in factories for chicken parts. But do not sentimentalize. Do not imagine barnyard life is a bowl of cherries.","Kant taught us that we should follow just those rules of conduct that we would want everybody to follow. Few find this generalization of The Golden Rule a great help.","I have this extraordinary curiosity about all subjects of the natural and human world and the interaction between the physical sciences and the social sciences.","Despite a certain amount of rhetoric, such as 'the second American Revolution,' there is a fair consensus about which events in the affairs of a people can rightly be called revolutions. It is also clear that such revolutions are proper objects of study for the historian.","Every once in a while, something happens to you that makes you realise that the human race is not quite as bad as it so often seems to be.","Foucault's genius is to go down to the little dramas, dress them in facts hardly anyone else has noticed, and turn these stage settings into clues to a hitherto un-thought series of confrontations out of which, he contends, the orderly structure of society is composed.","The stability of what's called the Standard Model of particle physics and its ability to make so many clever predictions with immense precision suggests that we may just be stuck with it, and there may never be an overthrow of that.","Each of us becomes a new person as we re-describe the past.","Emotions come first, and in the most direct sense: you first have an emotion and then have a feeling. But also first in the history of the human race, for the ability to have emotions long preceded the ability to have feelings.","It is so hard to make important decisions that we have a great urge to reduce them to rules.","The debate about who decides what gets taught is fascinating, albeit excruciating for those who have to defend the schools against bunkum.","Cutting up fowl to predict the future is, if done honestly and with as little interpretation as possible, a kind of randomization. But chicken guts are hard to read and invite flights of fancy or corruption.","If you were just intent on killing people you could do better with a bomb made of agricultural fertiliser.","I think it's unfortunate when people say that there is just one true story of science. For one thing, there are many different sciences, and historians will tell different stories corresponding to different things.","Molecular biology has routinely taken problematic things under its wing without altering core ideas.","I'm a dilettante. My governing word is 'curiosity.'","In every generation, there are quite firm rules on how to behave when you are crazy.","What are the relationships between power and knowledge? There are two bad, short answers: 1. Knowledge provides an instrument that those in power can wield for their own ends. 2. A new body of knowledge brings into being a new class of people or institutions that can exercise a new kind of power.","Foucault is one of many who want a new conception of how power and knowledge interact. But he is not looking for a relation between two givens, 'power' and 'knowledge.' As always, he is trying to rethink the entire subject matter, and his 'knowledge' and 'power' are to be something else.","One ought to begin an analysis of power from the ground up, at the level of tiny local events where battles are unwittingly enacted by players who don't know what they are doing.","Dolomite is a whole mess of stuff, a mixture. It gets characterised as 'a stuff' because of the interest of oil geologists. It would have been a nonentity were it not for its applications.","If you are a researcher and want to publish a paper, if you are applying for money either from a private or public foundation, you have to have a DSM code.","Great books are rare.","One of Kuhn's marvellous legacies is science studies as we know it today.","Kuhn was the intellectual of whom many scientists said he's 'telling it as is it is' insofar as talking about a process of 'tinkering' in terms of theory and experiment followed by radical changes. But often, what Kuhn had in mind were some very spectacular incidents in the history of the sciences that changed our way of looking at the world.","One of the things Kuhn said about normal science is that people 'expect' things to be discovered.","The anti-Darwin movement has racked up one astounding achievement. It has made a significant proportion of American parents care about what their children are taught in school.","The public debate about evolution itself, as opposed to whether to teach it, is something else. It is boring, demeaning, and insufferably dull.","Unfortunately, anti-Darwinism keeps playing minor variations on the same negative themes and adds nothing to our understanding of life.","Some people say they use images to help them remember intricacies. Others say they just remember. If they are able to form an image of the face, it is because they remember how it was: it is not that an image guides memory, but that memory produces an image, or the sense of imaging. We have no agreed way to talk clearly about such things.","All peoples have evolved extraordinarily precise ways of settling issues about the things that matter to them.","We do not need to have a way to talk clearly about other people's images.","Antonio Damasio is a distinguished neuroscientist with a flair for writing about science and an enthusiasm for philosophizing.","Brain science will be the most popular science of the early twenty-first century.","The walking wounded, impaired in life and dissected in death, were our primary clues to where and how parts of the brain work.","Amartya Sen is best known to the general reader for his powerful essays on famine. He is an optimist about some of our gravest economic problems, such as mass starvation in a world that at present can easily produce more food than everyone can eat. Reason and voluntary participation are his watchwords.","Among the lesser effects of quantum theory are gaping holes in old ideas about causality.","A 'philosophical dictionary' is not a dictionary of philosophy that you use to look up obscure thinkers or recondite terms. It is a collection of brief and pithy essays on diverse topics, informed by one vision, and usually arranged in alphabetical order.","Secrecy is one of the shadier sides of private and public life.","Although some secrecy is odious, some is essential just to preserve our sense of self.","The word 'revolution' first brings to mind violent upheavals in the state, but ideas of revolution in science, and of political revolution, are almost coeval. The word once meant only a revolving, a circular return to an origin, as when we speak of revolutions per minute or the revolution of the planets about the sun.","As a political metaphor, a revolution could, in that sense, mean only a return to better times, or to the true constitution: a ridding of excess or usurpers.","It is possible to argue that our present conception of revolution was staked out more securely in science than in political action.","Philip Kitcher thinks that mathematics is surprisingly like empirical science. Few mathematicians would agree; philosophers too, from Socrates on, have held the opposite opinion.","Risk analysis can cater to any sort of hazard, but their profession owes its existence to a relatively narrow band of possible dangers.","It is a general truth that students of language in every era try to colonize some or all of the other human sciences."],"Ian Hamilton Finlay":["People have always found me challenging - I don't know why, when I am only being myself. I don't understand why they find me so annoying but they do. It is pity, but that is how it is.","My position is that since the non-secular status of my garden is not recognised by the law; by the world of the public, then the garden can only be private. So, I closed the garden to the public.","As a friendly one. I would still like to write concrete poems, but I can only do it sometimes.","For me concrete poetry was a particular way of using language which came out of a particular feeling, and I don't have control over whether this feeling is in me or not.","But I can only write what the muse allows me to write. I cannot choose, I can only do what I am given, and I feel pleased when I feel close to concrete poetry - still.","But at the beginning it was clear to me that concrete poetry was peculiarly suited for using in public settings. This was my idea, but of course I never really much got the chance to do it.","I am not a modern man, I am just a wee old fashioned one.","No, I don't make my work in order to challenge or confuse other people's expectations - I only do what I find natural.","I came to these mediums through having the garden, and of course, people who have designed gardens have always worked in collaboration, and never made their own inscriptions.","The same sort of thing happened in my dispute with the National Trust book: Follies: A National Trust Guide, which implied that the only pleasure you can get from Folly architecture is by calling the architect mad, and by laughing at the architecture.","Little Sparta is a garden in the traditional sense. It is perhaps not like other modern gardens, but I think that other times would have had no difficulty with it.","I have often said that just as the French revolution, for instance, understood itself through antiquity, I think our time can be understood through the French revolution. It is quite a natural process to use other times to understand your own time.","I am always a beginner. I only try to include different parts of life; the pastoral, the tragic, et cetera.","If the work is pure then you have to think it could be understood. If it is not understood it doesn't mean that your work is not accessible. It doesn't worry me, but, of course, I would be pleased if people liked my work.","However, I don't feel the world is looking over my shoulder when I am working - I never think about this at all. What I think about is trying to make my work pure, and if it is pure then it can be accessible. It is quite straight forward really.","What you compose with is neither here nor there, you compose with words, or you compose with stone plants and trees, or you compose with events; the Sheriff's officer, or whatever.","But you have to understand that I consider myself a very modest artist, or whatever, and not of importance really at all - it is quite embarrassing to me to be asked my opinion about things. I am only a wee Scottish poet on the outside of everything.","Well, probably I was fed up with concrete poetry. There was a lot of bad concrete poetry and besides, it was confused with visual poetry which was completely different."],"Ian Harding":["My mom is in the navy and my dad works for the army, but I never called them 'sir' or 'ma'am' or anything like that, and we never really moved around a lot because both my parents were stationed in D.C.","My favorite subject was either English or History. I had a really awesome high school education.","I always was getting into trouble some way, because I was really good at lying when I was a kid.","I get recognized in the street really frequently, which is really shocking. I'm excruciatingly wary of any female under the age of 19. Even when some of them come up to me, they're usually very cordial, nice and polite.","Any skills that I have, I couldn't really make money with them. I would like to think that maybe I would be doing something in psychology or something of that nature because I love that vein of medicine - the getting down and getting nitty-gritty.","If there were teenagers who had a video camera and saw what I did on a daily basis, they'd be bored out of their mind.","English was great because I could just write my opinion, and that was good enough. I was terrible in Math, even though I had amazing Math teachers. My favorite subject was either English or History. I had a really awesome high school education.","It was awkward because the high school that I went to, my aunt taught at, it was this private boy's school in D.C. There were one or two teachers that I had the hots for, but never fully expressed my feelings because my aunt was always watching.","'Pretty Little Liars' is very all-consuming of my time, but I guess it's a great problem to have... there have been other things that have come that were on the table and then were not."],"Ian Hart":["There's a statistical theory that if you gave a million monkeys typewriters and set them to work, they'd eventually come up with the complete works of Shakespeare. Thanks to the Internet, we now know this isn't true.","Even before my audition, there were several pages missing from my script because those bits were so unbelievably secret not even I was allowed to see them.","Everyone should be good at what they do.","I don't know how to construct a career that'll make me famous. Except maybe get my ears pinned back, get my teeth done, and go to America. But then I'll be competing with billions of actors who haven't got false teeth, and who are 25.","I hate auditions - when I'm doing them, I can't wait to get out the bleeding door.","I just wanna build momentum again. Keeping yourself in work is one thing, keeping yourself in good work's another. But if it doesn't work out, so be it. As the Taoists say, Learn to accept that which you cannot change.","I just want to be rich and famous.","I need something to do when I'm not working, or I crawl up the walls. So I've just taken up kung fu. I was looking for some kind of calming, relaxing activity. I tried yoga, but it wasn't really me.","I was relatively technically adept. I can edit and wire up a light.","I'm belligerent rather than ambitious.","I'm not usually attracted to big-budget American films.","I'm still working, I've got two arms, two legs, two gorgeous kids, a lovely wife. Fifteen years ago, I was homeless. So when you think about it, I'm lucky.","I've only used my own voice about four times on film.","It's not any desire on my part to start playing dads, but it's a convention of drama. If you don't get the parts of young people going out to nightclubs, you have to play their fathers.","Most good roles are written for young men. We are fixated on youth. So however much people say there is nothing wrong with being bald, the reality is once the hair is gone, you might not get the parts.","My philosophy was, if I just do good work, someone will like it enough to employ me. It never made me famous. And I'm way, way too old now, mate. That boat's sailed.","Not being able to work would make me very unhappy.","That's what I like about Neil Jordan's films: everyone is better at what they do than you are.","We tend to think about fascism in terms of the Second World War.","Well, put it like this, if you're not a kid, you're a wizard.","When you get to 15 and most of your teachers are priests, there's bound to be a conflict.","You learn more doing than doing training."],"Ian Hecox":["Usually in a Smosh sketch, we get 60 shots, 12 hours to shoot - we're just going 'bam, bam, bam.'","We're trying to always expand Smosh and make Smosh a big thing.","Finding things to wear is what the Internet's for.","I just write what I think is funny. I don't care who watches it.","California must be a really big fan of the 'Hunger Games.' Because it's always catching fire.","We were very fortunate to be in YouTube in the very beginning. There wasn't a lot of content on there, so we were pretty easy to find on YouTube. That was really helpful in growing our channel."],"Ian Hislop":["For a long time I thought I should be a civil engineer. That seemed to be the only thing worth doing, and I chose the wrong subjects at A-level. I read all the sciences to start with, and then had to admit, 'This isn't what I want to do' and changed course.","The best comedy is where you attack the strong, not the weak.","All the libel lawyers will tell you there's no libel any more, that everyone's given up.","I've seen the Pokemon movie, which is probably the worst movie ever made on any subject ever.","No, there are no hard and fast rules about sources, no printed booklet to help journalists through.","This job certainly doesn't win you a huge amount of friends, I accept that, but it is very enjoyable, and deep down I think it's probably quite a worthwhile job.","Internet journalism is not a world we know very well at all. It's conducted more on the screen and less in bars, which makes it rather less useful for getting stories about people throwing up over one another, which is what one's after.","There's an awful lot of terrible television which I could do, but I mostly stick to Have I Got News for You.","They may well say not only is this not true, but I will put in an injunction to prevent publication. No, stories don't go in unless I'm convinced by the people who write them that they're true. And if I'm wrong, then so be it.","My mother was a terrific force in my life. Wartime-generation woman, hadn't gone to university but should have done. Was very funny, very verbal, very clever, very witty.","I'm often accused of being prudish, but the opposite is true.","It is no longer acceptable in British politics to be fat or eccentric or religious.","You can't understand Twenties England until you appreciate it was under a cloud of mourning. Nearly everyone was grieving.","I like making films about old people because they are repositories of amazing stories that they tell well. And they're incredibly good telly.","You have a huge amount of confidence when you're younger, which slowly ebbs away for the rest of your life. You think: 'No problem. I can do that. Why shouldn't I do it?'","I get paid to do what I enjoy, not that common a condition.","I've got a very peculiar sort of fame, based on being on the telly. It doesn't mean you have the lifestyle people expect.","I'd always assumed that I would die at about the same age as my dad - he was 45. I am five years in credit now. I can't get my head around the fact that I am older than he was - ever."],"Ian Holm":["The most important thing in the face is the eyes, and if you can make the eyes talk, you're halfway there.","All performances are different. I don't think it's necessary to compare one with another. I am just me playing the role of Lear. You're bound to get a Holm approach to it, whatever that may be. I just got out there and did it. I'm very much a doer in my acting.","As an actor, I'm very much a company person. And this also goes through my life: I have a dread of responsibility. I like someone else to be in charge.","It's not easy to shout against real elements. The elements are big, and the human voice is very small.","I grew up with the great Sir Laurence Olivier, and I think it's fair to say that a lot of actors of my age were influenced by his very individual vocal delivery. He was a showman who would always play to the gallery.","Scarlett Johansson was wonderful in 'Lost in Translation,' and then, seemingly within a couple of weeks, she became completely Hollywoodised. I was shocked. I didn't recognise her. I hope to God it's just a phase.","I get a lot of fan mail addressed to Bilbo and sometimes Sir Bilbo - it's hardly ever addressed to Ian Holm, in fact. My business manager drafts the replies, and then I pop in to the office and sign them, 'Bilbo!'","'Whatever it takes' is my opinion of method acting and, indeed, any other kind of acting. Look at Brando and De Niro. But it's not my cup of tea.","If everyone's ready for a shot to start, except for one actor who's intent on getting to the bottom of their soul, it can be a bit annoying."],"Ian Hunter":["It was a labor of love and they did really well.","Tell the truth.","Other people notice the same things but they don't think to put it to music.","I think writers, by nature, are more observers instead of participators.","The hardest thing is the idea. Ideas come from somewhere but as far as we know they come from nowhere."],"Ian Jackson":["What we did ten years ago with the Playstation was a phenomenal success story for the company. That product had a ten year life cycle, which has never been done in this industry.","We're going to create a portable handheld environment, and you should expect the same things you've always expected from Playstation - a great quality product, versatility, great value to the consumer.","I'm sorry if the following sounds combative and excessively personal, but that's my general style.","I think it's going to deliver on the promises we've said it's going to and it is going to be the most successful product ever to come into the handheld environment, and it just happens to have a number of different functions.","I think PSP is going to be the most successful handheld entertainment device ever. What it will do in terms of the versatility, obviously you can download music to it, and you'll be able to enjoy all your great tunes on it.","I think you can expect Sony, in the case of PSP specifically, to deliver a technology that is going to reinvent and change handheld entertainment, and take it to a brand new level.","If we deliver on those promises, we'll have done our job, and we did it with PSOne, and we certainly did it with PS2, and we are about to do it very rapidly with PSP. This is a whole new business for us, in terms of the handheld market, and we're going about it the right way."],"Ian K. Smith":["Intelligent, successful, attractive people can be intimidating. They force us to hold a mirror to ourselves; we can be disappointed, jealous or inspired toward personal growth.","I don't make resolutions, because resolutions seem so ephemeral and transient to go away.","People try to change too much at once and it becomes overwhelming, and they end up falling off the program. So gradually changing bad habits makes much more of a difference than trying to change them all at once.","The critical part with meal spacing is that you stabilize your hormones so that you do not have those spikes in insulin that occur when you eat large meals.","The idea behind diet confusion is, you have to keep your body off-kilter. So by changing the type of foods that you eat, the frequency of the foods that you eat, you can keep your metabolism revved up.","People think that you can save calories by eating fewer meals a day, but it works just the opposite: the fewer meals you eat, the more counterproductive it becomes to you being able to lose weight.","People have to realize that dieting is not a sprint, it's a marathon. If you celebrate the small victories, you will eventually win the war.","Women want to feel wanted. Men want to feel needed.","Men, in fact, are excited and looking forward to settling down and having families and being true partners with women in relationships that are full of excitement, unpredictability, adventure, and loyalty.","Men don't avoid successful women because they're jealous; they often do it to avoid being in competition with her next job promotion.","A lot of people who are overweight - not everyone, but a lot of people - are dealing with issues such as emotional issues, stress issues. They become stress eaters and emotional eaters.","Pleasure does not equal happiness; it's part of happiness.","I think happiness is a combination of pleasure, engagement and meaningfulness.","Death just comes, not happiness. Because when you're trying to find happiness, you're trying to navigate a very, very murky minefield of distractions, of disappointments, of deceptions. That's why you have to work on happiness."],"Ian Lustick":["International peace and security depend on certain taboos that are easily recognized when they are broken. It can be more important for an intervention to take place because nuclear or chemical or biological weapons are used as opposed to just measuring how many people are killed.","From a social networking point of view, Pakistan is not very far away.","For the U.S., as the largest player in the global environment, unintended consequences are magnified.","Strong Islamist trends make a fundamentalist Palestine more likely than a small state under a secular government.","Just as a balloon filled gradually with air bursts when the limit of its tensile strength is passed, there are thresholds of radical, disruptive change in politics. When those thresholds are crossed, the impossible suddenly becomes probable, with revolutionary implications for governments and nations.","The disappearance of Israel as a Zionist project, through war, cultural exhaustion or demographic momentum, is... plausible... Many Israelis see the demise of the country as not just possible, but probable.","My academic specialization is Arab-Israel relations.","Most Israelis have a sense, 'We just don't want to live in the Middle East anymore. We don't want it to be the Middle East. Were going to just build a wall or operate unilaterally' - not try to even use force as used to be the case to convince Arabs to accept Israel by convincing them that Israel is here to stay and then negotiating.","Americans should be wary of the Muslim Brothers in Egypt but not scared of them.","Democracies domesticate religious groups to become political players. That's how it works.","If you put too much pressure on the Palestinian Authority, it will collapse - it will disappear - and Israel will have to formally re-occupy the West Bank and assume responsibility for the Palestinians there. The United States doesn't want that. Israel doesn't really want that.","There's a good lesson for policymakers: It's not the presence of the U.S. that is a problem for many people in the Arab region; it's the type of presence we bring.","I think about terrorism in terms of popcorn. You can't tell which kernels are popcorn and which are not, but you assume you'll always have some kernels that are going to pop.","Do I trust Yasser Arafat? Of course not. Why should I? Why should anyone trust a politician, whether Shimon Peres, Ariel Sharon, Bill Clinton, Richard Nixon, Lyndon Johnson, Benjamin Netanyahu, George W. Bush, or Yasser Arafat?","Whether we agree with them or not, politicians aren't for trusting. They are for getting done what can be done to make really horrible problems into plain old lousy problems.","What we have really now is a one-state outcome in which Israel is the one and only state between the Jordan River and the sea. It can do whatever it wants virtually throughout the area. But that's not the kind of a state that's going to be a basis for peace and stability in the region.","The fact is that democracy anywhere in the world, including in the United States, is not something that comes easy. And yet, we are committed to it, and equality and democracy are the only ways in the long run that Jews will be safe in the Middle East.","Most Israelis do want to keep Israel safe. The question is how do you do that.","As long as Hamas needs the support it could conceivably get from the international community through the Palestinian Authority, it has an interest in playing nice with Fatah. And Fatah has an interest in playing nice with Hamas because it needs some source of legitimacy on the West Bank.","The leadership of the Palestinian Authority is not held in high regard by most of the population of the West Bank. They're seen as living relatively high off the hog and certainly not accomplishing anything vis-a-vis the Israelis.","When people today say 'racism,' they mean it's a nationalism they don't like. Racialism used to be a good thing, a looking-out for what was best for one group... Israel comes out of that 19th-century idea of nationalism. Many Arab states also have preferences. It's fundamentally unfair to decide that one is racism and the others aren't.","There's still a role for the Association for Israel Studies. But not as the endpoint of scholarship and not as a fortress to defend Israel.","The ability to calibrate risk doesn't happen rationally.","There is some big thing about the world that produced all these people willing to kill themselves just to hurt us. On 9/11 we learned we're part of that world, in the same completely crazy, drastic and arbitrary ways it hits other countries.","Israeli governments cling to the two-state notion because it seems to reflect the sentiments of the Jewish Israeli majority, and it shields the country from international opprobrium even as it camouflages relentless efforts to expand Israel's territory into the West Bank.","Peacemaking and democratic state-building require blood and magic."],"Ian MacKaye":["There are many things that people do happily that I can't imagine why they would do it... But I have to say that even though I am critical or judgmental of society at large, I'm not critical of people individually. We are who we are.","I never, ever had it in my mind that I wanted to be in the record industry, because I still contend that the record industry is an insidious affair. It's this terrible collision between art and commerce, and it will always be that way.","An unlocked door means that, occasionally, you might get a devil come in, but a locked door means you have thousands of angels just walk by.","I do feel like I have always, in my life, been inclined to be on the outside, walk a different path or something. Because of that, and increasingly over the years, my sense of distance from mainstream society or from the way culture works, I have a different kind of perception of it.","Part of the way the work world works is not so much creating a separation between your work and your free time, but creating the illusion of a separation between your work and your free time. Every day is the weekend for me, which means I'm always busy.","Music is a language and different people who come along are each using that language to do something different, but all coming at it in a similar vein inasmuch as it's always community based and for the most part nonprofit. Most bands don't ever come within a mile of profit - clearly these people are not playing music to make money.","I work so I don't need to make rent through my songs, and I think if more people engaged with music without needing it to provide for their welfare, you're not beholden to anyone.","To me, music is no joke and it's not for sale.","Basically we just created our own label, but again we just did it to document our own music and create our own thing, so the major labels were just always out of our picture, we're not interested.","Yeah, if someone's selling downloads and collecting money for our songs I would be unhappy about that but if they're trading it I don't mind, obviously if I make a thousand records or CDs or whatever, I like to sell a thousand.","I just have work to do; I just do it.","I'm not a religious person, and I'm not too interested in being a part of a religion, but I do like having some sort of communal gathering, and having some sense of peoples.","I feel quite connected to the past, and my memory. Everything that I've ever done I can still relate to, and feel connected to it in a way. There's no part of my life that I look at and go, 'I don't recognize that person at all.'","I consider the piano my 'main' instrument and have been playing for as long as I can remember. It seems to me that I might have come up with something resembling a song as early as 4 or 5 years old.","I have thousands of tapes, and photos and fliers, letters, posters, artwork - basically everything that ever happened, I kept. I'm not a hoarder, though. I'm sort of a librarian.","I stand behind all the lyrics I've ever written; I don't have a problem with that.","Major labels didn't start showing up really until they smelled money, and that's all they're ever going to be attracted to is money-that's the business they're in- making money.","I think sometimes my humor is extremely dry, and a lot of times I would say things that I thought were very funny but... I have a reputation of - people think of me as a very fundamentalist, humorless fellow.","When people who are songwriters say 'That's my property and if you give it away for free then I'll lose my incentive,' then, well, good riddance.","The first time I ever recorded, which was into my boom-box, I was like, 'Wow, check that out.' It sounded great. The narcotic of it was so intense - it was pleasurable. I was like, 'You sound like a band.' Then I ended up spending the rest of my life trying to chase that initial high again.","My point of view is, I'm just a person, and there are times when I look at other people and think, 'My God, they spend so much time thinking about things that seem so absurd.' But I'm sure people must think the same thing about me.","I was into Ted Nugent, I was a Nugent guy. I was a skateboarder listening to Ted Nugent.","I don't dismiss the music that I was involved with, I don't think it was a joke, I don't think it was funny or a phase, I don't think it was just something I was doing back then, to me it was who I am. It connects all the way through. I don't distance myself from any of it.","I'm always happy when I hear about people selling records or selling books or selling movies. It makes me proud of them.","There are certainly good examples of incredibly brilliant, beautiful music that has been made commercially available and sold everywhere. But I would say that, for the most part, quantity certainly does not speak well for quality.","At every election, my vote goes to the candidate less likely to declare war. You're dropping hugely expensive pieces of exploding metal on a population. America deserves the president it gets, whether the country votes for them or allows their vote to be stolen, and the least we can do is to elect someone who won't do that to other people.","I'm really anti-option, so computers have been my nightmare with recording. I don't want endless tracks; I want less tracks. I want decisions to be made.","Ultimately, I'm not the most prolific person, but I've been doing this for a long time, and I keep on putting out music. The only thing that drives music is the people who are making it.","I feel completely fortunate to have this outlet for something I don't really feel like I have a choice in, to make music. I've got to make it.","My focus is always on the day. What I've done behind me, I try to have respect for it, and keep an eye on it, and make sure it isn't abused, and obviously be thoughtful about it, because it's all real to me. I'm basically in every band I ever was in, and the songs, I still mean them all.","With Napster and the sharing of music, of course, there are going to be people who exploit it. Greed has no end. But there's a lot of good that could happen. We shouldn't let the economic concerns of the major labels infringe on our freedom to share music.","American business at this point is really about developing an idea, making it profitable, selling it while it's profitable and then getting out or diversifying. It's just about sucking everything up.","I've always been a bit of a documentarian.","I've had people call me from bands that are very popular, and they're like, 'What do we do? We want to do what you do.' It's almost impossible to do what I do, because you would have to start in 1980. You can't just do it.","The thing is, people can't complain about profit-oriented moves if they're only interested in profit themselves. You can't have it both ways. If they're willing to polish up a gift and sell it to make money, they can't really complain about the fact that somebody above them has sold them down the river. That's the way it goes.","I've done thousands of interviews in my life, and it's a format that I quite enjoy, because I think of questions in interviews as an opportunity to sort of gauge my growth in a way. It gives me an idea of how I'm navigating this world that I'm in.","And in fact, one of the central reasons why I never got involved with any drugs or anything is that I remember talking to people in maybe 1975 who saw Hendrix but couldn't remember it. I was like, 'How could that be?'","What I find interesting as a 40-year-old is the idea of trying to be a part of a pronounced, continuing independent culture. The basic tenet of America is that you rebel and then you get real.","I consider the guitar a tool for the most part. I do pick up the acoustic now and then, I certainly don't have any routine. Usually the only time I practice is when the band gets together. Hendrix has always been one of my favorite players, but I was a sucker for Nugent in the late 1970's.","Minor Threat was an important band, believe me that it was important it in my life, but it belongs to an era that no longer exists. I'm not nostalgic. I think music today is much more important, because something can be done about it.","When children start to speak they find their own voice by imitating the sounds around them. It would follow that bands do the same. Bands will find their own voice at some point."],"Ian McDiarmid":["That's the mark of a great storyteller, never to give away secrets in advance.","Consistency is very important when you're making films.","But he did say that the character would be on the sidelines in movies One and Two, and move into the middle with number Three, but I didn't realize he would move in with quite such a bang.","I suppose it's easy to play a hypocritical politician with a smiling face; it's also quite gratifying to play.","When George asked me to be the prequels, it was the same kind of meeting - it was very short and to the point. It was nice to see him after a long time, and we met in a hotel room.","To start your life as a character of 120 years when you are in your late thirties, and then go back in time about 20 years later to play the same character who is your own age then, its very complicated, but very interesting.","There were a number of people who helped me get there, and the one I always mention is Michael Byrne, the great master swordsman and brilliant stunt double.","It was a scene I was really looking forward to, and one that I embraced, and when we were filming it, George got closer and closer and closer with that camera - he was practically up my nose for the final shot. So I knew it was a moment that I had to do my best to get right.","If you got the DVD you can see that George Lucas has taken that person out, as well as the voice, and we shot this scene when we arrived in Australia during the actual filming of Episode 3.","The part that I think is one of the most interesting is of course the one that Hayden Christensen plays.","I'm the blackest villain of all time.","For me it's even more interesting, because my character comes out of the shadow. It's a chance to really act emotionally, because the situation is an extreme one.","And also, it's sort of my job to make you believe things about him that aren't true about me."],"Ian McKeever":["Everyone should learn to tango in Argentina before they die.","I have never had the money to make too many large purchases.","I don't spend a lot on holidays, but have been very fortunate to travel extensively through doing various challenges around the world. The best place I've ever been is Argentina.","I usually eat in my friend Tom Corcoran's place - the Siam Thai in Monkstown. I go there for a very large plate of beef in red wine sauce."],"Ian McLagan":["I was never really a Mod. I thought I was more of a beatnik with the brown corduroy jacket, blue jeans, etc. I loved the music Mods liked, and I loved the clothes, but I didn't have any money to spend on them.","We had something very special in the Faces. We were blessed to have the fun we had.","Small Faces were really a soul band as far as we were concerned. That's what we listened to; that's what we played, you know? We were pretty much based on Booker T. and the M.G.'s.","My love for American music and American movies is from an early age. I was 10 or 11 when I heard Fats Domino and Little Richard and Buddy Holly. And the movies, my dad used to take my brother and I to the movies every Friday. It was incredible: we got to see just about every movie that came out for a period of years.","You don't stop thinking about women just because your wife dies. It's terrible, but you know. I just want the hugs, the kisses. A kiss!","I'm terrible remembering lyrics. Before a tour, I have to remind myself. I have to go through the songs.","What I do for migraines when I get them, I listen to classical music, and I turn it up really loud.","I loved rock and roll when that came in, Bill Haley, Little Richard, Fats Domino, Buddy Holly, Elvis Presley, all those great records. So I begged my mom and dad for a guitar, which eventually they did get me for Christmas, but it went out of tune very quickly, and it hurt my fingers.","When I joined Small Faces, we occasionally would bump into The Who. And Keith Moon and I became firm pals.","I am so blessed that all I've done in my professional life, since I was 17-18, is play music and somehow make a dollar here and there.","I sing to my wife; it helps me. She was my muse. I've written so many songs about her, to her, with references to her, and still do. She's a big part of my life. We were together for 33 years. It actually does me good - she's with me all that time in that way.","The Small Faces was such a different band than the Faces. I know three of us are the same, but when you take Steve Marriott out, it's a very different band.","The Small Faces are thought to be a one-hit wonder in America because we only had 'Itchycoo Park.' Then the Faces just had 'Stay with Me.' So both bands could be considered one-hit wonders in America, even though we had several huge hits in England.","I only seem to date younger women.","It's tough to be 68 and dating. I've given it up now.","I like the fact that Austin's the first place I've ever lived where there's a real sense of community. People care about their neighbors."],"Ian McShane":["The bad boy: always more fun.","You don't know where life takes you.","Seventy years old! How did that happen? I was part of the generation that wasn't going to die.","I don't believe in the death penalty, but I understand personal vengeance.","There's only two kinds of actors - good ones and bad ones... and lucky ones and unlucky ones.","You set paths for yourself, but as you get older, things change.","What you do is, you just do the gig, enjoy, get on with it, and treat the rest as horse doodle.","I think the reason 'Sexy Beast' was so good was it wasn't just another run-of-the-mill gangster film; it was a love story.","Every actor has to love and loathe the character he plays.","I'm from the disco era where everybody thought they were John Travolta... What song is going to get me on the dance floor? Anything from 'Saturday Night Fever,' and you're up there like a demon.","Do you follow American politics? They hate Obama. Hate him. He's a black man. That's what it is: it's racist. This guy is no bleeding-heart liberal. He's a centrist.","You don't particularly want to stay close to your ex-wife. Or why would she be your ex-wife?","Acting's boring.","I come from the liberal side of thinking: Better one guilty man should walk free than one innocent man found guilty.","I mean, I'm an actor. I do what comes along.","I'm a child of the Sixties.","I had a bit of a male menopause. It started at the age of 18 and continued until I was 45.","I don't remember my first two marriages... the details are very sketchy.","Bosses will tell you they are looking for something different but they're not, actually.","As long as the cheques carry on coming in, and I'm enjoying my work, I shall continue acting.","When you're in your early 20s, you go ahead and do everything. And it's very hard to judge yourself.","Theater is a dance of a different kind, a dance of rawness and characters stripped down.","My dad was a football player - a soccer player - for Manchester United, and I loved playing football, but I also happened to be the guy in class who was pretty good at sight reading. My teacher gave me scripts, and I was very comfortable.","I don't do social media.","'Lovejoy' has a special place in my heart because it was through my efforts that the series first came to the screen.","What's great about acting is you can let all your wackiness hang out while you work.","The bad boys get all the best lines.","Robert Fisk is my hero. In America, they think he's a terrorist.","My second marriage was to a girl I met in Manchester, kept a long-distance relationship going for two years, then we got married... disaster.","My daughter said, 'I don't think granddad really suits you.'","I never wanted a life of having a nice house, driving around, settling down.","I would like to be in a really big, successful film - boffo, spectacular, $500 million!","Acting is great therapy - you get to do things you'd normally get arrested for.","People tweet before they think, and it becomes obsessive.","Whenever there was a pause on the 'Hercules' set, everybody whipped their Blackberries out of their skirts - 'Are you texting the King of Thrace to tell them we're on our way?'","I enjoy every role I do.","If 'Deadwood' had gone on another two years, I wouldn't have got as many movies made.","What 'Deadwood' did was to talk about how capitalism started, how civilised society came in, and how that brought its own problems.","Mum and Dad were both happy for me to do what I wanted.","When you're doing a medieval show like 'Pillars,' it starts off a bit like a school play. You're all in funny costumes; you've had your coffee, and you say, 'Good morning'. Then you go on set and, if you've got good actors and directors, it takes on a life of its own.","I don't want to be in 'Expendables 5.' You can keep those kind of movies.","I had a teacher at school who said, 'We are going to do a play next year, and you're in it.' He said, 'You should try out for the Royal Academy as an actor.' I did and got in. I was 17. My mum wasn't too happy, but it worked out OK.","Blackbeard is probably the most infamous pirate who ever lived. He's one of those characters for which most of your work is done before you start.","If I'd had the choice when I was 14, and someone had said to me, 'You can either be a footballer or an actor,' I'd have said: 'Well, can't I be a footballing actor?'","When you've done a show that's as successful as 'Lovejoy' was, it hangs around for a few years, and people know you from it. I escaped the shadow when I stopped 'Lovejoy' by not doing any television for four years.","I don't think that acting is as youth-obsessed as the general culture. In acting, as you get older, you get better, and the parts you get improve, too. But that's only true for a man, not a woman.","I've never hankered for any role."],"Ian Mcewan":["You can spin stories out of the ways people understand and misunderstand each other.","I wouldn't mind being the lead guitarist in an incredibly successful rock band. However, I don't play the guitar.","London in the '70s was a pretty catastrophic dump, I can tell you. We had every kind of industrial trouble; we had severe energy problems; we were under constant terrorist attack from Irish terrorist groups who started a bombing campaign in English cities; politics were fantastically polarized between left and right.","I think of novels in architectural terms. You have to enter at the gate, and this gate must be constructed in such a way that the reader has immediate confidence in the strength of the building.","Now, I'm an atheist. I really don't believe for a moment that our moral sense comes from a god.","I want to live in a place where strangers rush to help someone in distress.","You enter a state of controlled passivity, you relax your grip and accept that even if your declared intention is to justify the ways of God to man, you might end up interesting your readers rather more in Satan.","The end of secrecy would be the end of the novel - especially the English novel. The English novel requires social secrecy, personal secrecy.","It is not the first duty of the novelist to provide blueprints for insurrection, or uplifting tales of successful resistance for the benefit of the opposition. The naming of what is there is what is important.","What I've discovered and really confirmed to myself is that opera really likes loud colours, and you need something bold, something savage, unpredictable, passionate. You can't really run a two-hour opera round some muted murmuring.","The moment you have children and a mortgage you want things to work; you're locked into the human project and you want it to flourish.","I was an intimate sort of child who never spoke up in groups. I preferred close friends.","By concentrating on what is good in people, by appealing to their idealism and their sense of justice, and by asking them to put their faith in the future, socialists put themselves at a severe disadvantage.","A twenty-one-year-old writer is likely to be inhibited by a lack of usable experience. Childhood and adolescence were something I knew.","Scientists do stand on the shoulders of giants, just as do writers. Conversely, in the arts we do make discoveries. We do refine our tools. So I am arguing with, or at least playing with, the idea that art never improves.","One has to have the courage of one's pessimism.","Politics is the enemy of the imagination.","Atheists have as much conscience, possibly more, than people with deep religious conviction, and they still have the same problem of how they reconcile themselves to a bad deed in the past. It's a little easier if you've got a god to forgive you.","I've yet to meet somebody who said, 'Your stories are so revolting I couldn't read them.'","I always used to deny this, but I guess what I'm really saying is that I was writing to shock... And I dug deep and dredged up all kinds of vile things which fascinated me at the time.","Not being boring is quite a challenge.","What reader wants to be told what attitude to strike?","I'm quite good at not writing.","Some people are tied to five hundred words a day, six days a week. I'm a hesitater.","I often don't read reviews.","I don't hold grudges.","Reading reviews makes you thin-skinned. It's like waves washing layers off your skin.","At the risk of sounding like Virginia Woolf, I could live on £700 a year.","Oh, I've become immune to the Booker. I think we need something a little more like the Pulitzer prize, where there isn't this great race.","I don't really believe in evil at all.","I don't believe there's any inherent darkness at the center of religion at all. I think religion actually is a morally neutral force.","My father's drinking was sometimes a problem. And a great deal went unspoken. He was not particularly acute or articulate about the emotions. But he was very affectionate towards me.","My parents were keen for me to have the education they themselves never had. They weren't able to guide me towards particular books, but they encouraged me to read, which I did, randomly and compulsively.","Perhaps the greatest reading pleasure has an element of self-annihilation. To be so engrossed that you barely know you exist.","In my experience an appreciative letter from a fellow writer means a lot.","What is it precisely, that feeling of 'returning' from a poem? Something is lighter, softer, larger - then it fades, but never completely.","I apologize for being obvious, but every time I watch the curtain come down on even a halfway decent production of a Shakespeare play I feel a little sorrowful that I'll never know the man, or any man of such warm intelligence.","Novelists have to be adept at controlling the flow of information, and, most crucially, they have to be in charge of the narrative.","You could say that all novels are spy novels and all novelists are spy masters.","When I began I thought that literature was contained within a bubble that somehow floated above the world commented upon by newspapers. But I became more and more interested in trying to include some of that world within my work.","It's good to get your hands dirty a bit and to test how you see things at a given point. And it's very pleasing after writing something like 'Atonement' or 'On Chesil Beach,' which are historical, to get involved in some plausible re-enactment of the here and now.","I actually find novels that are determined to be funny at every turn quite oppressive.","The best way to tell people about climate change is through non-fiction. There's a vast literature of outstanding writing on the subject.","I put it to you that there are no British poets, there are no British novelists. I have heard myself described as one, but I think really I'm an English novelist; there are Scottish poets and Scottish novelists.","As regards literary culture, it fascinates me that it has been so resilient to the Union. For example, when T.S. Eliot wanted to become poet in these lands, it wasn't as an English poet, it was an Anglian poet he wanted to be.","How often one reads a contemporary full-length novel and thinks quietly, mutinously, that it would have worked out better at half or a third the length.","We overvalue the arts in relation to the sciences.","Something is missing in our culture. We can't quite celebrate the scientific literary tradition.","It should simply be an empirical matter whether the climate is changing or not and whether we're responsible. But the various sides of the debate have now become so tribal that it's no longer a matter of changing our views as more information comes in.","True intelligence requires fabulous imagination.","If I could write the perfect novella I would die happy.","One important theme is the extent to which one can ever correct an error, especially outside any frame of religious forgiveness. All of us have done something we regret - how we manage to remove that from our conscience, or whether that's even possible, interested me."],"Ian Mckellen":["Try and understand what part you have to play in the world in which you live. There's more to life than you know and it's all happening out there. Discover what part you can play and then go for it.","The battle going on over gay marriage in America reveals an awful lot. The Bible belt - people hate gay people. Because the Bible tells them? No, the Bible tells them an awful lot of things that they ignore.","I often get mistaken for Dumbledore. One wizard is very much like another.","You mustn't upstage the bride.","I'm brilliant at cooking my stepmother's scrambled egg recipe. The secret is to put eggs, butter, milk, and seasoning together in the saucepan, and to keep stirring with a wooden spoon under a low heat until the preferred consistency is reached.","If you get criticized, good - I don't think people get criticized enough. People talk behind your back and they criticize you, but they don't often come up and say it to you.","I'm not quite as cool as I would like to be, really.","I used to comfort myself when I became an actor that it was a useful job, entertaining people. And it was important to do it as well as you possibly can.","Personally, coming out was one of the most important things I've ever done, lifting from my shoulders the millstone of lies that I hadn't even realized I was carrying.","You always think that 70 is the end of the road: 'Somebody died when they were 73; good life'. You're closer to death, and you better make sure you don't waste too much of your time doing things you don't want to do. No point in saying things you don't believe in.","It's only fair that stable gay relationships of long standing should have the same rights and responsibilities as married couples. I know the image of gay marriage is to some people horrific and ludicrous.","There's something wholesome about the theatre.","What's upsetting about an autobiography is that the final chapter is always missing. I mean, you want the death, don't you?","I've often thought the Bible should have a disclaimer in the front saying, 'This is fiction.'","Acting is a very big part of what human beings do. A dog is always a dog, but we're always changing.","Why do you act? You act for an audience. In the theatre, you're in their presence. Film stars don't know what it is to have an audience.","The thing you notice here after America is how refreshingly ordinary people look because they haven't had their chin wrapped around the back of their ears.","I think the point to be understood is that we're all different. I've never been a fan of theories of acting. I didn't go to drama school, so I was never put through a training that was limited by someone saying, 'This is the way you should act.'","No actor wants to play to an empty house.","Thanks to every gay person in public and non-public life who has come out.","When I've been asked what should be on my gravestone, I've said: 'Here lies Gandalf. He came out.' Two big achievements.","In any human-rights campaign, everybody must do what they can.","I always walk up the escalator on the Tube, and I live in a house with a lot of stairs, and that's good exercise, but you need more than that.","There is a fantasy as old as the modern gay rights movement that if all our skins turned lavender overnight, the majority, confounded by our numbers and our diversity, and recognising a few of our faces, would at once let go of prejudice forevermore.","Every anti-gay remark from the Church gives the thug a license to be cruel.","If I was on a march at the moment I would be saying to everyone: 'Be honest with each other. Admit there are limitless possibilities in relationships, and love as many people as you can in whatever way you want, and get rid of your inhibitions, and we'll all be happy.","When you were on stage, you could be absolutely open about your emotions and indulge them and express yourself in a way that - in real life - I wasn't doing.","The spirit of the four hobbits in 'Lord of the Rings,' I suppose I miss that.","It's nice for me to be in touch with a younger generation.","My friends are my family.","Godot is whatever it is in life that you are waiting for: 'I'm waiting to win the lottery. I'm waiting to fall in love'. For me, as a child, it was Christmas. At least that eventually came.","It's my impression that I've done every job that I've been asked to do.","When we'd suggested doing it, the Theatre Royal management had said, 'Nobody wants to see Waiting for Godot.' As it happened, every single ticket was booked for every single performance, and this confirmation that our judgment was right was sweet. Audiences came to us from all over the world. It was amazing.","People who are truly horrible are often the most interesting people in the room. You look at them and just say, 'Why?'","I just followed my parents' example and advice on living, which was to leave the world a better place than you found it. They were professional do-gooders, ministers of the church, social workers, teachers, and missionaries, that sort of thing.","Acting is a very personal process. It has to do with expressing your own personality, and discovering the character you're playing through your own experience - so we're all different.","Before acting, I wanted to become a journalist. I also toyed with the idea of being a chef - but that's only when people asked me what I wanted to be. In fact, I always used to say I wanted to be an actor, but I didn't ever believe that I was good enough to be come one.","I certainly don't disparage someone whose attitude towards their work is utterly different from mine - that's up to them.","I have got prostate cancer, and I have to keep monitoring that. It's no problem, it's under control and I'm very cool about it, but other people are dying from it.","The one thing you can ask, I think, is that actors get paid a living wage. I would like it if all the repertory theatres that currently exist could do that. It would make a huge difference.","Tolkien is as good as Dickens at sketching a scene.","There have been many gay knights in the past - like Sir Noel Coward or Sir John Gielgud.","I don't really like being with people my own age for long periods, because all we talk about is our decrepitude, how the world is changing for the worse even though it isn't.","I've got a waistline to develop.","I learned that coming out was crucial to self-esteem.","I live for the text. It's my job.","If you've got Mystique as your girlfriend the fun you could have in bed - I've just imagined X-Men 3 might open with me in bed with Patrick Stewart.","It was wrongly assumed that I wished to become some sort of leader among gay activists, whereas in reality I was happier to be a foot soldier.","That was the big effect Lord of the Rings had on me. It was discovering New Zealand. And even more precious were the people- not at all like the Australians.","I don't make much distinction between being a stand-up comic and acting Shakespeare - in fact, unless you're a good comedian, you're never going to be able to play Hamlet properly.","I tend to discourage people from calling me 'Sir Ian,' because I don't like being separated out from the rest of the population. Of course, it can be useful if you're writing an official letter, like trying to get a visa or something passed through Parliament. They're impressed by these things.","There's no sex in Middle Earth.","I can't take on all the worries of the world, you know. I can only talk about being gay and being an actor. I'll have to leave those other battles to somebody else.","Macbeth is a very popular play with audiences. If you want to sell out a theater, just mount a production of Macbeth. It's a short play, it's an exciting play, it's easy to understand, and it attracts great acting.","I was brought up in industrial south Lancashire, down the cobbled road from where LS Lowry (1887 - 1976) lived and painted.","I headed out to have a breather at the stage door, dressed in my tramp costume. I had my bowler hat between my feet and there were passers-by, and one of them turned back and said, 'Do you need help, brother?' And $1 fell into my hat!","There are not many things in my life I can be absolutely proud of or certain I got right, but one of them is that I've got better as an actor. I've learnt how to do it. And I still have enough energy to do it.","So it's joyful to me, in my 71st year, to be able to be in a play that is absolutely right for my age and my experience, and that is a popular success. What more could you ask as an actor?","There are some tremendous actors in the U.K. who have been knighted, and I've spent much of my life admiring many of them, like Laurence Olivier. So it's very flattering to be in their company. But you also end up in the company of people you don't admire, including some rather dodgy politicians.","'Macbeth' was a very lucky play for me.","The most likely explanation is the most practical. 'Macbeth' is a very popular play with audiences. If you want to sell out a theater, just mount a production of 'Macbeth'. It's a short play, it's an exciting play, it's easy to understand, and it attracts great acting.","I have little routines in the theater. Once I've established something, like the order of putting on makeup and a costume, I have to invariably do it in the same order every time, even if I only did it by chance the first time round.","When you grumble about a taxi being dirty, people your own age will absolutely agree with you, whereas younger people say, 'You should be so lucky to have a taxi - I walk to work!' So I have lots of young friends, who fortunately don't treat me as a guru, a person that knows all the answers.","My ambition is to get better as an actor.","We're very lucky, men, that there are these fabulous parts. Women - once you've done all the parts in Shakespeare, they start running out. So you can pick and choose and find something to energise you.","I'm only an actor. I'm not a writer. I'm not going to leave any legacy. All I've ever done is learn the lines and say them.","Theatre is relatively easy if you're British - you're living in the theatre capital of the world, London - there are so many places you can work, still. If I had begun to think of myself as a film actor, I think I would have got distracted.","I'm fortunate to be famous for two rather imposing characters like Magneto and Gandalf.","What I particularly like about Broadway is the camaraderie and the friendship of other people in other shows. Everybody knows you're opening and cares about you. There's a real village atmosphere.","I think New York audiences are some of the brightest in the world, and certainly the most enthusiastic.","You put anyone in the outfit, and they look like Gandalf. Not that clever.","Until I came out, my acting was all about disguise, and thereafter it became about telling the truth.","If I have any audience, they can know that anything I am in, I would go see, with the expectation of being really satisfied.","I love working in New York.","The strength of British theatre should be that these actors in their middle years know what they're doing and are good at it. Not rich, not famous, but making a living.","I got better as an actor, and still I'm getting better. That's only been possible because there's always been work.","I've always had very catholic tastes.","'Lord of the Rings' was about saving the world, big time, big duties.","Before I ever acted as an amateur - which I did a great deal at school and at university - I used to go to the theater with my parents in the north of England, where I was born and brought up... Theater of all sorts.","When I left Cambridge, I applied to regional repertory theaters in the U.K. and got accepted by one of them... And here I am, still at it.","I don't any longer make any quality judgement between theater and cinema. They are different experiences for the audience, and they also are for the actors - although they have a lot in common.","I came rather late to film. I've done an awful lot of theater before - before I discovered the camera, you know, seeing everything, requiring much less acting and - and much less presentation, much less projecting, more just being.","When I was playing Gandalf, I didn't think, 'Oh my dear, I'm playing a 7,000 year old wizard,' because I've never met one, and I don't know what they're like.","Gandalf saves the world and saves the soul of the world, really.","I don't make any distinction between a popular TV series or blockbuster film and doing Shakespeare. They're different, but as long as the material is good and the intention is honourable, it's all the same to me.","I was a shy gay man at a time when it was illegal to be gay.","There are a lot of actors - I'm probably one - who are most at home when they're on stage.","Magneto wants to cope with the difficulties thrust upon him by society and by his own nature.","Tony Blair is not a villain, but he's played the part very well.","Bill Gallagher's new version of 'The Prisoner' is an enthralling commentary on modern culture. It is witty, intelligent and disturbing. I am very excited to be involved.","It's an interesting but useless bit of information that every single character in 'The Lord of the Rings' and 'The Hobbit' wears a wig, and many of them wears a prosthetic - false ears, feet, hands. In my case, nose.","One thing Middle-earth is short on is the feminine.","No one seems to wash in Middle-earth.","In the past, kids didn't tell their parents they were gay, so there were never the bust-ups. Some parents react so strongly to the news that their children are gay that the reaction is, 'Get out of our house.' There's a residue of old prejudices that are going to die hard.","Gandalf is in Middle-earth to keep an eye on everybody, and that can be a rather serious matter.","Gandalf the Grey was always the guy I prefer. Gandalf the White was driven to do a particular job, whereas Gandalf the Grey is a bit more humane.","The whole atmosphere of the book, the tone of 'The Hobbit,' is of a kid's adventure story, told in the first person by Tolkien, who is introducing young people to the notion of Middle-earth. A lot of it is very light-hearted.","I increasingly see organized religion as actually my enemy. They treat me as their enemy. Not all Christians, of course. Not all Jews, not all Muslims.","The conventional wisdom is that if you are gay, you cannot play the romantic straight lead in a movie.","There are still times in my life where I pull back from being totally honest, and I can't imagine a single straight person who would understand that.","There are some tremendous actors in the U.K. who have been knighted, and I've spent much of my life admiring many of them, like Laurence Olivier. So it's very flattering to be in their company.","If you've been in a film that's seen by millions and millions and millions of people, you're more likely to be recognized for that than for your theater performances, which were seen by considerably less people. Why would I get upset by that?","There are people who've enjoyed my work in the theater, and they let me know that it was special for them. I'm not going to say, 'Well, you should have seen me as Gandalf!'","I'm the sort of person who doesn't write in ink. I only write in pencil, so it can be rubbed out.","I have heard of people dying from prostate cancer, and they are the unlucky ones, the people who didn't know they had got it, and it went on the rampage.","Because I was in the business of translating the 'X-Men' from the very successful comics, and taking the most popular book of the 20th century in 'The Lord of the Rings,' and making it into three movies, I hope people realize I wouldn't get involved in anything I didn't think was really going to be worth their while.","To be allowed for the first time in your later career to play leading parts in extremely popular movies is not a situation to worry about.","Anyone in public life who comes out, comes out primarily for themselves, and their life is immediately improved. That's what happened to me.","Anyone who thinks Peter Jackson would fall for market forces around him rather than artistic integrity doesn't know the guy or the body of his work.","If we just made one movie, 'The Hobbit,' the fact is that all the fans, the eight-, nine- and 10-year-old boys, they would watch it 1,000 times. Now, they've got three films they can watch 1,000 times.","One school invited me down, as two pupils had come out, and the headmaster didn't know what to do about it. I said, 'How many students here are gay?' and he said, 'Just these two.' Clearly not. 'How many gay members of staff have you got?' He had no idea. And this was a concerned man.","Establishing the rights for gay people to be married would cost the Australian government nothing financially and would gain for you worldwide respect from people like us and, of course, would change lives enormously - the lives of gay people and of their friends and of their families and therefore of Australia as a whole.","My own death threats have declined considerably.","There are deaths in public places on the grounds that the victim is gay.","If I say often enough that I'm going to be in 'King Kong,' I'm hoping that Peter Jackson will take the hint.","The BAFTAs give the British point of view, and the Oscars give the American point of view, but the truth is we're all working in an international industry.","I can't make up my mind whether I want to dance like Josef Brown or dance with Josef Brown.","Why not celebrate those who want to marry and bring up a family?","Very, very rare that you do a job knowing that the audience is desperate for you to do that job. Most films you make don't get released, is the fact.","There are some fantastic parts for older actors.","I certainly wouldn't define myself as a northerner. I'm not even really sure what that means. I've lived in London for 50 years. I wasn't born here, but I have spent most of my life here. So I don't make much of it, to be honest. I'm just myself.","When I appeared in 'Coronation Street,' I lived in Manchester and enjoyed it very much.","Bolton School has a great tradition in the liberal arts.","I think with Shakespeare you can be required to do absolutely anything at the turn of a sixpence - suddenly you go into a battle, suddenly you utter something passionate.","I am lucky, I don't have aches and pains. I do Pilates regularly, which is a series of stretching exercises, and I recommend it to anyone of my age because the temptation is not to exercise when you get older. Well, you should.","The wonderful thing about modern medicine is that so many of these complaints that used to signify old age and decline can be coped with.","It is really, really wonderful that in your old age you are protected by specialists who understand your problems and sort them out for you. Well, isn't that what we all need?","Capitalism offers you freedom, but far from giving people freedom, it enslaves them.","Gandalf is ever-present in my life. I like it.","The press like to talk to actors. They mustn't be surprised when actors talk back to them.","You won't hear me talk about my politics, you won't hear me talk about my vegetarianism, you won't hear me comment on the Iraq war. You'll only hear me talk about being gay and being an actor. I am just public on those two issues.","I'll never put my memoirs in print.","Eventually, before I die, I hope to have written about every part I've played.","I'd never read 'Lord of the Rings' until I was asked to play Gandalf, so I didn't really know it was a frightfully famous book.","I had never come across the 'X-Men' comics till I was asked to play Magneto, so I just jumped into that job.","'King Lear,' I've been seeing all my life. I mean, the great actors of my lifetime... to join their company, as it were, by playing a part that's challenged them, is one of the great joys of being an actor who does the classics.","Most actors are not rich - they are very poor indeed. What keeps them going is that they just love the job.","I know actors who have had to turn down good roles because they just don't pay enough. It's hard.","Who does understand life?","I have lots of fans, they are mostly under the age of 12, boys and girls.","Gandalf's a good guy, and it's a good part. He says the right things, he believes the right things. An actor can have fun with it.","There's lots of Tolkien that must be confusing to people.","In the '50s and '60s, the life of a gay man was a secret. Homosexuality was illegal, so you didn't draw attention to yourself.","Even now, there are young actors who want careers as romantic leading men, and the best thing is not to reveal you're gay.","When I came out, I told my stepmother Gladys, and she just said she had known for years and was glad I wasn't lying anymore.","I remember Tom Stoppard saying to me when I came out, 'I feel so sorry for you, because you'll never have children.' These days I would say, 'Well, why not, Tom?'","You might be surprised by how interested young people are in older people.","The huge difference in my lifetime is that you can just go up to somebody and make a pass. You couldn't do that in the 1950s if you were gay. There were secret handshakes, a secret language. There was nowhere you could go to be romantic outside of people's houses.","Shakespeare's villains are fabulous because none of them know that they are villains. Well, sometimes they do.","Will I miss Gandalf? Well, I don't miss him, because people are constantly coming up to me mentioning him and talking about him, so I don't feel that I've lost contact.","Every time you work is a challenge. There's a constant worry about it, and it's a side of acting I don't like.","In the U.K. there is still work to be done, particularly in schools, stopping the homophobic bullies in the playground and introducing unbiased discussion on gay issues in the classroom.","In Singapore, Malcolm X type of activity would be extremely difficult because the government can be very harsh on lawbreakers.","When I went to lobby Nelson Mandela while the post-apartheid constitution was being drafted, I asked him to endorse making it illegal to discriminate on grounds of sexuality. I'd been warned that he might giggle if I mentioned homosexuality.","Fame creeps up on you.","I'm not someone who wears shades all the time and ducks into a darkened car in case I'm recognized - that would be absolute misery.","I love musicals; I love the ballet, opera, the circus. It's all performance to me.","Imagine trying to be a gay actor, a gay anything in modern Russia? Where to be positively oneself, to be affectionate in public with someone you love of the same gender, or to talk of that love in the hearing of anyone under 18, will put you prison?","The first film role I deliberately chose to play after I came out was a raging heterosexual, John Profumo.","I don't normally take to Yorkshiremen.","It's easier to go from theatre to film than the other way round. In film you're absolutely loved and cossetted and cared for. In film your director makes your performance. In theatre you're carrying it all.","What's nice for me, having identified myself for years as being rather shy, is now, wherever I am, in public, there tends to be a friendly face who's pleased to see me, and I like that.","Actors don't, in fact, retire, do they? It took me a while to remember that.","I don't have Gandalf the White's certainty about everything.","I think I've become more modest as the years have gone on.","If you are playing King Lear you are the centre of attention anyway. You don't need to draw attention to yourself. It's all laid out for you.","You see people in Hollywood trying to make blockbuster after blockbuster, but it's not possible. There's some god up there saying, 'You will fail now.' But I suppose that's true of us all.","I'm not being offered a constant stream of wonderful parts with wonderful directors that would keep me away from the theatre. When they turn up, I do them.","I used to think 'King Lear' was an analysis of insanity, but I don't really think it is. When Lear is supposed to be at his most insane, he is actually understanding the world for the first time.","'The Lego Movie?' I've never heard of it.","People on television have trouble with fame because audiences think they're their mates.","I got intrigued by working in small theatres.","'The Da Vinci Code' is the most popular book of our times.","I don't think many people will re-read 'The Da Vinci Code.'","I'm an eccentric English actor, and there's a lot of us around.","If I was a star, it would be difficult to go off and do 'Coronation Street.' So I guess I'm not a star.","I owe a great deal to Harold Hobson, doyen drama critic of the 'U.K. Sunday Times,' who championed me as Shakespeare's Richard II at the 1969 Edinburgh Festival.","I love the Broadway audiences, who relish live drama and don't hesitate to display their enthusiasm.","I've always felt that 'X-Men' was about something serious. It wasn't just fantasy.","Doing some of the 'Lord Of The Rings' press junkets got a bit claustrophobic.","I get pretty grumpy about TV.","Splendid architecture, the love of your life, an old friend... they can all go drifting by unseen if you're not careful.","How do I act so well? What I do is I pretend to be the person I'm portraying in the film or play.","On the whole, actors shout when they don't know what they're doing, trying to make an impact.","Quakers are terrific.","Some relationships get easier as you get older, depending on what sort of person you are. I don't think I've got any better at them.","I like sleeping a lot.","I quite like it when I'm on the Tube and people offer me their seat. Sometimes I take it. The other day I was offered a seat by a pregnant lady. I thought, 'That's going a bit far.'"],"Ian Millar":["It's about discipline. It's about following instructions. It's about the execution of the plan. That's what sport is.","My first Olympics was Munich in 1972. I am better now than I was then, in knowledge and experience. The age of top riders generally tends to be older than in other sports because it takes a lot of time to be consistent.","I work out every morning for an hour while in front of the news channel or business channels, then I'll ride for four, five hours a day. So I'm on the move all the time, and I think that's the key. A body in motion tends to stay in motion. That's the law of physics.","If you persevere long enough, if you do the right things long enough, the right things will happen.","The minute I put my leg on a horse and say, 'Come on, let's go,' I absolutely believe that the horse and I can do it and that we will do it. And I am always shocked when we actually don't do it. If the analytical mind ever overrode that optimist in me, I'd be in some serious trouble.","Obviously, as you get a little older, you are not going to be quite as quick or quite as strong, and so I might be regarded by some as the underdog... There is actually a statue of Big Ben and I in Perth, Ont., and I was on a Canadian stamp once, and normally you have to be dead to do either of those things, and, well, here I am, still going.","When we train a horse to do a certain job, we're training the horse to be like a soldier, and yes, he still has a spirit, and he still has his ideas, but he is a disciplined soldier, and in the end, he will follow the rider's instruction to do what needs to be done.","In sport, all my fellow riders and trainers and the people I meet and deal with have just accepted the fact that I'm here forever.","A surgeon wouldn't sell his tools. A lawyer doesn't sell his law books. I'm not going to sell my horse. I'm a sportsman.","I've been lucky to ride 10 different horses at the Olympics. I'd like to think that of all of them, Big Ben - who was inducted into the Canadian Sports Hall of Fame - would still be competitive in the contemporary sport.","As we know, all sports evolve tremendously, and our sport is no different. It's really not the same thing at all as it was in 1972. It's a different type of horse we're using. The style of riding is quite evolved, the way the courses are built, the materials used... it's virtually unrecognizable.","I would never want to be selected to a team just because I am going to set a record. It's critical to me to earn my way.","It's always a thrill to wear the flag and ride for Canada in any competition, but especially the Olympics.","I remember back in the early '70s, when I had a disastrous Grand Prix, my wife, Lynn, said to me, 'Don't worry, you're going to be a late boomer.' That's what she said to me, and I've always held that thought."],"Ian Paisley":["The gun is not out of Irish politics."],"Ian Rankin":["I don't have many friends. It's not because I'm a misanthrope. It's because I'm reserved. I'm self-contained. I get all my adventures in my head when I'm writing my books.","Right from the very beginning, I knew I wanted to write palpably Scottish fiction.","The most difficult part of any crime novel is the plotting. It all begins simply enough, but soon you're dealing with a multitude of linked characters, strands, themes and red herrings - and you need to try to control these unruly elements and weave them into a pattern.","I am, of course, a frustrated rock star - I'd much rather be a rock star than a writer. Or own a record shop. Still, it's not a bad life, is it? You just sit at a computer and make stuff up.","I still think most writers are just kids who refuse to grow up. We're still playing imaginary games, with our imaginary friends.","I think writers have to be proactive: they've got to use new technology and social media. Yes, it's hard to get noticed by traditional publishers, but there's a great deal of opportunity out there if you've got the right story.","You need a great idea, but then you've got to carry it through. If you get it right, you're going to be a critical success. But not everyone who works hard gets it right, or has the success they deserve: there's an element of luck.","My first novel was turned down by half a dozen publishers. And even after having published five or six books, I wasn't making enough money to live on, and was beginning to think I'd have to give up the dream of being a full-time writer.","I used to think that: whenever I heard that someone had taken 10 years to write a novel, I'd think it must be a big, serious book. Now I think, 'No - it took you one year to write, and nine years to sit around eating Kit Kats.'","No matter how many awards you've won or how many sales you've got, come the next book it's still a blank sheet of paper and you're still panicking like hell that you've got nothing new to say.","I'm interested in Scotland now and then, how it's changed. I want to get the reader to think about that by thinking about something from the past. How has society changed, how has policing changed, have we changed philosophically, psychologically, culturally, spiritually?","I've always written. At the age of six or seven, I would get sheets of A4 paper and fold them in half, cut the edges to make a little eight-page booklet, break it up into squares and put in little stick men with little speech bubbles, and I'd have a spy story, a space story and a football story.","I wrote my first short story for a competition and won second prize. Another competition came up and I won first prize. The first story was published in a newspaper. The second went out on radio.","I took the first James Kelman novel, 'The Bus Conductor Hines', home to my dad. I thought, 'My dad will like this; it's written in Scots.' But my dad said: 'I can't read that.' He was reading James Bond and John le Carre. That was part of what attracted me to crime - the idea of getting a wide audience.","A lot of writers, especially crime writers, have an image that we think we're trying to keep up with. You've got to be seen as dark and slightly dangerous. But I'm not like that and I've realised that I don't need to put that on. People will buy the books whether they see a photo of you dressed in black or not.","I don't think I have one particular favourite writer. I have many whose works I will always buy or reread - Muriel Spark, Anthony Powell, Robert Louis Stevenson, Ruth Rendell, James Ellroy, William McIlvanney, Kate Atkinson, John Burnside, Louise Welsh, Iain Banks.","I'm often asked how I write books, but I don't think my approach is suitable for everyone. If I walked into a creative writing class, all I could say to them was 'I tend to make it up as I go along.' I'm not sure that's brilliant advice.","At all times, think like a writer, and keep those antennae twitching - that way, you pick up new ideas.","I wanted to be able to support myself without begging for handouts from the state. All of the writers I knew when I was a student were all getting grants from the Scottish Arts Council.","I dunno whether it was to do with my parents - we were working-class - but it was important to me to be self-sufficient.","I don't want the books to become PR exercises for the police; I want to have the freedom to write about cops who cross the line: bad cops.","I don't hang out with cops.","I grew up in a family that was working-class, which taught me to be careful with money.","My mother worked in a school canteen - then worked in the canteen of a chicken factory. Every Friday, the pay packet money would be allocated to cover bills.","My father worked in a grocery store. When the grocery chain went into administration, he eventually got a job in the naval dockyard in an office preparing the charts for the boats and the submarines before they headed out.","I have a strong work ethic, yet I'm incredibly lazy as well. The problem with being a writer is that everything you do can be called research. Sitting in the pub is research. Reading the newspaper can be research.","My parents were working class and didn't have much money, so holidays tended to be two weeks in a caravan at St. Andrews or a B&B in Blackpool.","When I was in my early 20s and still at uni, I won a short-story competition: £200 was the prize.","In 1991, I won the Chandler Fulbright Prize, which came with $20,000 and the stipulation of spending six months in the U.S.","I go to Canada at least every two years.","'Jekyll and Hyde' I read in high school. I was expecting a Hollywood-type horror story and couldn't believe it when I got this very complex narrative from all these different points of view.","I would have loved to have been a rock n' roll star. But none of us was musical, and none of us had any instruments.","I wrote 'Knots and Crosses,' the first of the Rebus books, not even realising that I was writing crime fiction.","I'm not qualified for anything. I've had lots of little jobs, like picking grapes and being a tax man. I can't imagine not writing, because I've done it since I was five or six. Maybe I'd work in academia. That's always what the plan was.","In real life, writers tend to be quite boring, but in our books, we're having exciting adventures all the time.","I'm not Rebus. We're not the same. I don't even think he'd like me if we met. He'd think I was a wishy-washy liberal.","The great thing about America is I always come back with more books and more tip-offs of who to read. It's a country in love with crime fiction.","People aren't coming to me looking for political essays or polemic - they're looking for a rattling good story.","When I'm writing, I won't know whodunnit until maybe two thirds of the way through. Until then, I know as little as my detective. I just make it up as I go along. It's nerve-wracking, actually. You'll be half through and not know your conclusion. You worry one of these days the ending won't come. I'll be left with only two-thirds of a novel.","Writers always think their greatest work is just ahead of them.","Punk gave you a kind of chutzpah, so even trying to be a writer, I just thought, 'Well, I'm going to send poems to 'Radio Times,' short stories to the 'Observer,' just have a go.","Being working class, my parents thought, 'Ian's going to uni, the first in the family,' and I'd do dentistry or accountancy. I was going to do accountancy; then I got a C in Economics and thought, 'Why am I doing this?' The only thing I was interested in was books and literature.","Why does any novelist keep writing long after they've made money? Because they've failed to write the perfect novel."],"Ian Rush":["I couldn't settle in Italy - it was like living in a foreign country.","You've got to have a dream... if you don't have any big dreams, nothing happens.","Moving from Wales to Italy is like moving to a different country.","Even all the top players going to Europe to play helps soccer in America, as do all the MLS players like Beckham and all that, they're trying to promote it. At the end of the day it's about getting the younger generation interested at an early age so most of them will move on and play.","It's different from Liverpool. Boston seems to be a friendly place.","There are a lot of famous comedians from Liverpool, then obviously the Beatles, and the football club. That's what people in Liverpool are passionate about.","I think great players can play in any year, that's why they're great. A lot of it is down to the mental approach.","You can enjoy yourself, but you need to look after yourself as well.","I just wanted to play as long as I could. When you stop playing, you're not going to get it back. When you don't enjoy it, that's the time to pack it in.","I love horse racing, I play golf, and I love travelling.","I've got tremendous respect for different cultures, for the food and everything.","I like the Stereophonics. I know the lead singer, Kelly Jones, and there's the Welsh connection.","The only thing I can cook is Welsh rarebit.","I've got a place in Portugal, which I like very much, but I've just been working in Malaysia for five weeks. My family had a chance to come over and we really loved it, particularly the island of Pangkor.","I was so shy when I was younger. When I first went to Liverpool I didn't say a word for a year.","In India, kids need someone to look up to. They've got it in cricket: they have Tendulkar and others.","Mainly it's the parents who remember me. But the kids today, what they do is go and Google you. A lot of them turn up and they know everything about me. They say: 'You scored 346 goals' or 'You wore the No9 shirt for Liverpool.'","I've done my coaching badges, I've got my Pro Licence, but I enjoy what I'm doing now. I'm also the elite performance director of the Welsh FA. The main thing for me was always Liverpool Football Club and my country, Wales - and I'm lucky enough to still be involved with both of them.","I realised I'd been spoiled at Liverpool. We were used to winning. In Italy I grew up as a person. I didn't enjoy the football, mind. It was very defensive, but I became a better player because of the work I had to do around the box. Off the pitch, I learned about what to eat and what to drink to be successful, and I learned about life.","People say you should go out at the top but I was enjoying my football so much. Robbie Fowler's exactly the same: he's not playing for money any more, he's playing for enjoyment. Why go out at the top if it's going to make you miserable? I just wanted to play as long as I could.","This is why cup finals are so special because on the day anyone can beat anyone. That's what it's all about and that's why for me the FA Cup and the Carling Cup are the best cups in the world. That's the beauty of the cup."],"Ian Schrager":["The music I listened to as a kid - the Stones, the Beatles - that was so rebellious at the time, it became mainstream.","I'm not into nostalgia, and I only look back to find lessons.","I consider myself fortunate to have grown up in Brooklyn. It's what gave me my drive to succeed, the upward mobility I've been after my whole life.","Great ideas have no attachment to either money or class.","When I travel, I just take what I need and I run. I always have my briefcase stuffed with work, even when I go on a holiday.","My best vacation was renting a boat and motoring along the Adriatic, going along the Croatian coast, before it became so fashionable. I've also sailed around the Turkish islands, the Greek islands and Sicily.","The trimmings of wealth are not as important to me and my generation as they were to my parents' generation.","Status based on wealth is an old-fashioned idea; I find it repugnant, actually.","Good design is good business.","I have to be more universal than my projects, but no less innovative."],"Ian Smith":["Poor air quality, which can be influenced by a variety of fumes, chemicals and allergens, is arguably the leading cause of triggers for most asthmatics in urban areas.","Everything we did was criticized. For about thirty years we lived with the world against us, accusing us of things we didn't do!","I would say colonialism is a wonderful thing. It spread civilization to Africa. Before it they had no written language, no wheel as we know it, no schools, no hospitals, not even normal clothing.","Freedom. And Justice. If you have those two, it covers everything. You must stick to those principles and have the courage of your convictions.","Declaring independence was the most traumatic decision I had to live up to. Because I didn't want to do it.","The only violence was when these so-called 'freedom fighters' terrorized the poor Africans in the villages... They were told what to do and who to support.","The risk from viruses is an unanswered question - and it won't be answered until you have had organs transplanted into humans over many years.","If my children were hungry I should think I would steal to feed them.","I always try to be reasonable and effective.","Every human being makes mistakes."],"Ian Somerhalder":["To explore different parts of yourself and different emotional lives... not to hide from who you are but to actually explore who you are.","Every love story needs a catalyst of some sort.","I have a million acquaintances but just two or three true friends. I can't hide anything from them.","I grew up as a country boy.","I work with the Humane Society a lot and have three rescue cats.","You can't get anywhere without the people who have come into your life.","I can't let time move on without fighting tooth and nail and hopefully being a part of a revolution that is positive.","I kind of think too much, I try do too many things at once.","What we're doing to the planet is inexcusable.","Love is tested in so many ways. How do I articulate this? Two people are together. There are stakes, strife, struggles, all these things that make us fall for someone, love someone even more, leave someone.","I don't care how hot a girl is - if she doesn't like animals, it would be a major, major problem.","It's so great to show up at work and truly enjoy every word you say.","Kids are meeting in coffee shops and basements figuring out what's unsustainable in their communities. That's the future.","A lot of things that happen in the world make me a bit crazy.","I don't ever want anything to come in the way of me truthfully telling a story.","I can write with absolutely perfect penmanship with my feet. If I broke both my arms, I could still write a girl a love letter using just my toes.","Oceans are one of the most important things in the world now and that is a national security threat of the United States of America, to be honest with you. That is why seeing the habitat destroyed is so short-sighted by us.","Acting is such a huge part of my life. It really allows me to have a creative outlet and to actually be able to have an outlet to discuss openly the things that truly I think are relevant in the world, that make a difference.","No one knows what women want!","Before vampires were aesthetically appealing, they were physical anomalies and ostracized outsiders whom we banished to the dark, and they didn't have the appeal that they do now.","I don't know how to do anything else other than be an actor. If I wasn't in this, I would be in alternative energy and conservation.","I have the attention span of a mosquito from multitasking and all the things that have affected my poor little brain.","I never wanted to be one of those actors with a political agenda.","I'm not a negative person.","There are always decades that interest people. For me, that's the Roaring Twenties.","I appreciate the response and the support of fans, of people who actually don't mind watching me on screen... I just don't ever want to jeopardize that.","My great-grandchildren will not be able to enjoy the Gulf Coast of Louisiana the way I have.","I've never been on a TV show for more than a season and you have to continually keep it interesting and you have to keep it connected, even as you change.","I aim to direct as much as I act at some point in time.","You spend enough time on set as an actor and it's great when a director was at some point an actor or understands acting. They're able to finesse performances out of you that a lot directors can't get.","I've sorta learned that I'm so tired of taking myself so seriously. It's so great to show up at work and truly enjoy every word you say.","They say the way to a man's heart is through his stomach. It's the same way with women... or at least the ones I want to be with.","I'm never running for office. I love being able to speak to members of Congress or members of the Senate and floating on either side, because it takes all of us. It's going to take both of them.","The coming together of like-minded individuals through action is what's needed to see wide spread change for us, our planet and its creatures.","The most underused, under-appreciated group of people in the world is our youth.","Maybe one of the only things I do well: I cook like a maniac! I would be a chef if I weren't an actor.","We're made up of energy, so who's to say you can't transmit through electrical means? If you could transmit yourself wirelessly, then it's Armageddon pretty much.","I want to bulk up. I'm a skinny guy.","When you're really close to someone, they can make fun of you a lot and get away with it. But they sort of poke you in all of the right places.","I just want to make it clear that I have been working since I was ten years old.","I have been doing commercials on camera since I was ten.","I never had any backlash from the model-turned-actor thing.","The film business creates a large amount of waste, and I'm not immune to waste in the business.","Lack of time and money create really bad green practices.","Species conversation is beyond a doubt an issue that truly matters to the American public.","As an actor, you always think that whatever job you have is going to be your last. In some way, shape or form, you think you're going to screw it up and you're never going to work again.","The quality of life is so much higher anyplace you can ski in the morning and surf in the evening - there's something to be said for that.","I'm from the gulf coast of Louisiana.","I don't want to see blood spewing out but I don't mind it in controlled environment. Does it make me squeamish? No.","I'm a good driver.","I'm from New Orleans. There's a lot of vampire mystique and mythology that resonates there, and I was fascinated by it. I always wanted to play one.","I mean, there are some amazing storytelling being done on the small screen right now. That's what so cool about being in television right now. Studios, networks are starting to throw more resources, better writers, more production values... and to be part of that is awesome.","There are certain places in the world that are kind of energy vortexes, which are phenomenal."],"Ian St. John":["I wouldn't be surprised if this game went all the way to the finish.","Christ, he was paranoid about criticism. I used to say: why doesn't he worry about the team and forget what people are saying? He got Phil Thompson, who was a kid coming through when I was a Liverpool player, to have a go at me. So now I don't talk to him.","I don't want to see people decorating a house or digging a garden. As for guys like Jonathan Ross, he got an award there last Christmas. What for? He doesn't sing, dance or tell jokes, does he?","If I had been trying to take the job away from him in a sneaky, underhand manner, then I deserved all I got. But it was the other way around. I was trying to get him the job.","Once you're on the wheel, you don't come off.","Trying to take the credit for Jamie Carragher and Steven Gerrard, who had been at the club since they were eight. Can you believe it? I can't.","We went to dinner and healed the wounds, at least to a certain degree. But I hope he understands the hurt he did to me. He put the boot into a pal and I don't think you should do that.","Well, he doesn't make me laugh. I think I've got a fair sense of humour but I can't really see it in him. I've listened to his show on the radio on a Saturday morning, and that's a load of mince as well.","Yeah, right. I mean, he criticises everybody in the media, then the first thing he does when he finishes is he goes to work for the media. Thompson, too. Hypocritical."],"Ian Thorpe":["I'm still swimming.","I've enjoyed training again, I've enjoyed pushing myself in the pool and I'll keep on swimming until I feel I cannot get any more out of myself.","Compared to how I have raced before and how I have competed, the success that I have had, this does look like doom compared to it.","The fairytale has turned into a nightmare.","For myself, losing is not coming second. It's getting out of the water knowing you could have done better. For myself, I have won every race I've been in.","I've missed out on a huge goal but the desire is still there.","I think now I'll probably take a few days off and enjoy the competition and then sit down with a few people and work out what is next, work out what the next preparation will be and what competition will be next.","I'm disappointed that I really haven't been able to race in a way that is reflective of the amount of work that I have done and how I have trained. But I don't regret giving this a go.","Sometimes we question things that we have done in our lives but how many times do we question what we haven't done in someone else's.","Remember to do the things you enjoy away from swimming, regularly.","When I started this I wanted to get back in the pool, I wanted to race and I wanted to go to the Olympics. I still want to do all of those things.","I'm more comfortable knowing that, chances are, I'm going to fail at this. I've become comfortable with that.","I thought I could, and thought I would, swim a lot quicker - much quicker.","I'll go for broke. Swim faster. It's not going to be easy - this whole thing was never going to be easy.","I think it's better to attempt something and fail than it is to not even attempt it, so I'm glad that I've been prepared to put myself on the line there."],"Ian Wace":["More than 200,000 kids have had their lives transformed by ARK. I use that word properly.","You have to offer a product that creates an environment that captures donations, but at the end of the day, it's not the environment that draws in the money but the cause.","There's a generation of people who've made their own money and are among the most generous people you would ever meet."],"Ian Watson":["I think it's safe to say that 'manliness' was a common theme in my upbringing. It was an assumed status, but - and here's the important bit - it was the Rudyard Kipling kind. The emphasis was on gentlemanly conduct, sportsmanship, fairness and stoicism.","I'm going to do the old 'plaster removal' technique and just get the pain over with in one go: 'Life's Too Short' isn't funny to me.","Basically, I tend to see the world differently to other people, and I write books and stories to alter the imagination of people so that they also see the world in a different way.","My father-in-law just happens to be a global procurement guru. Now retired, he was the global head of procurement for some of the biggest companies in the world as well as our very own treasury.","Tokyo in the late 1960s seemed to be like one of the futures that science fiction presents. Here was the proto- super-technology of the future, electronically, robotically, blahblahblah, intercut with traditional Japanese cultural patterns, Shinto patterns.","I worked with Stanley Kubrick for almost a year back in 1990, trying to develop the screen story for his project 'Artificial Intelligence,' which is about a robot boy who wishes to become a real boy, a future scientific fairy tale inspired in the myth of Pinocchio.","I think we are living in paradise with regards to the ways we can amuse ourselves, communicate. We have such a richness of possibilities.","The only time I even entertain the tiniest element of religion is for Christmas carols.","It's bad enough being conned into singing an anti-war message by John Lennon when you think you're just wishing everyone a merry Christmas.","The fact is that most 'Irish-Americans', in spite of dropping the word 'Irish' into half of all sentences, couldn't find Europe on an atlas, let alone Ireland.","Warwick Davies is a cracking actor. The opening scene in the last 'Harry Potter' film, where he plays a captured Griphook, is mesmerising. His pacing is sublime, and the menace and regret he builds into the scene is fantastic.","Every joke in 'The Office' was unexpected. I cringed; I could hardly look. I cried with laughter.","My wife will automatically quote and compare the price of diesel at every petrol station we drive by, like she's got oil-based Tourette's.","That iPad you just bought. Do you care that it cost a few pence to manufacture? No. It's cost you several hundred pounds because somebody else was willing to pay that much for it. If they weren't... it wouldn't.","People with a lot of money aren't in the business of throwing it away, and those paying footballers' wages, organising parking spaces for dead sharks, and even, dare I say it, buying iPads, are doing it because, for them, it's worth the money.","I'm working class. Not because my family have always been skint or because I'm from the grim north, but because I am from a class of people who believe in work. In paying their way.","When I go to the interviews and sit before a prospective employer, I'm going to try and look as employable as I can.","I believe I've got the best of both worlds - a modern man with old fashioned values. I'm happy to be a house husband but won't let my wife carry her own bag.","Dad's funeral was standing room only; most in attendance were strangers to me. At the back, a lone Marine stood silently, then left. People told me he'd saved their life or helped them in their darkest hour."],"Ian Williams":["There is something magical about three you know - a trio is tight and nicely economical.","I think one of the most boring things is a person's taste.","I think there's a lot of naivete and hubris within our mix of personalities. That's probably our worst crime. I keep wondering what a 'mature' record means.","Now and then, I had moments of greatness, but I never knew how to duplicate it consistently.","I don't like giving names to generations. It's like trying to read the song title on a record that's spinning.","I think when I began, I played distortion more than the guitar. The results of my strumming. Now I play the twang of the string, which is a lot closer to the source of the sound making.","We made happy sounds because we were upset... just trying to make a positive situation out of a negative one.","I definitely like the mystery of not knowing how things will turn out, you know.","We're not ever interested in repeating ourselves or doing what people expect us to do, it's such a turn off.","I'm too tasteful for my pants.","This is fun; consuming our music shouldn't be a responsibility like eating your spinach or something.","A lot of people on the internet have been saying that there's no way we can pull off a musical in three acts. We just take that as a challenge.","It's like that Simpsons joke - they're filming a cow in a movie and they go, 'OK, we'll tape a bunch of cats together to make a cow', and it's like, 'Why don't you just use a cow?'. For some reason that is novel - like, 'Oh, my guitar sounds like a piano and now if I can just get my piano to sound like my guitar'.","I don't think our music has much to do with math rock.","Our music doesn't make many compromises, but we take it into a venue that's larger than people expect."],"Ian Wright":["I never travel without my sketch book.","My name is usually the one on the end of people's lips."],"Ian Ziering":["To be with old friends is very warming and comforting.","Failure is not an option. So, we're committed to the success of not just our relationship but to raising two amazing girls... It's dedication. We've anchored ourselves to a foundation of accountability, and we've set out to be successful at this, so we're going to do it.","My career actually started in the second grade as class clown. That's no joke. I was always making people laugh, and it was really to mask a learning disability... When it came time for me to read out loud, I would crack jokes or create a diversion.","Being married, I don't know how to describe it. It's very comfortable when you find the right person. It all comes together beautifully.","Past success is no guarantee of future success, so I have learned to be an entrepreneur. I began to produce and direct my own projects.","I enjoy the holidays, but I'm back to work pretty quickly.","When I met my wife, I was forty-six, and it was love at first sight. Every day, my love grew deeper as I found out about her family values, that her parents were still together, that she wanted kids. So we fell in love, got engaged, got married, and a month later, we were pregnant!","We're living in a society where you need to be accountable for your actions, for your behavior - for yourself. To sit back and be reactive would be to allow your children to make big mistakes without the benefit of your wisdom being bestowed on them. It's not what my parents taught me.","It's intimidating when you have to stand onstage amongst a bunch of men who are dedicated to maintaining peak musculature and athleticism, and they're six-five, 240 pounds of twisted steel and sex appeal. It's a lot to stand up to... My goal is to not look like Chris Farley.","I love coming to Las Vegas. I've always loved it and always had a good time.","I'm tanned from head to toe, and it looks like I've been in The Bahamas.","I believe the digital world presents tremendous opportunities for the producers who understand it, and I am launching a digital production company, iMan Productions, to take advantage of this opportunity.","Some of my earliest memories are dancing in the kitchen, standing on my mom's toes.","I view having celebrity as having capital, and I don't know a better way to spend that capital other then helping people.","I think this show can have legs for a long time. That's why it's called 'Beverly Hills 90210' instead of something like 'West Beverly High.'","I like the fact that I'm involved in a career that gives me so many different mediums to perform in.","We barely had cell phones on '90210.' It started in the '90s. That's pretty much when fax machines came into play. When I first got the script for '90210' I had to come into New York to get it. It was not emailed to me; there was no email.","I don't get claustrophobic.","I like action-adventure movies.","I'm a student of the movies. I'm a student of all media. This is what I do, and I like to immerse myself in what's current and what's topical. And I find that I'm drawn to those things.","I began modeling in N.Y. and doing commercials. That led to regional theatre and then Broadway and then movies.","My most famous commercial was for Fruit Of the Loom underwear. I took a lot of razzing from my classmates.","There are so many people that say they are actors and they don't spend for 5 minutes a day working on their craft. You need to train and need to take classes to keep your tools sharp. I'm always in class, whether it's theater or drama workshops.","People have always told me I look young for my age... and I think it's because I've always taken care of myself.","I've always been a fan of Fran Drescher!","Like every audition I go on, I do my best, but after that, I let it go because, you know, the rejection rate is so great in Hollywood, and I can only control what I do in the audition, and after that it's up to somebody else.","Being married, I've got so many things to do that I am the last to do things for myself. Taking care of my body has been difficult, but I am doing the best that I can.","I think my perspective on my age is really irrelevant.","I'm doing what every guy in America has secretly fantasized - being a Chippendales dancer and having women throw themselves at you.","More people than not have seen me on television in swim shorts, so I don't have any problem stripping down.","When I was a kid, it was always very embarrassing for me if I wet the bed - I was 5 years old. I didn't want my parents or my brothers to find out because they'd bust my chops to no end.","I'm a dad, and that's a job you can't fail at.","I always wanted to do action-adventure, and science fiction genres were always something that were of great interest to me.","The opening scene from 'Sharknado' I think was better than the original 'Jaws' movie. It was scarier, it was bloodier, and it had more high-anxiety moments than the original 'Jaws' movie. And that movie kept me out of the ocean for a summer.","At my pregnant wife's behest, I took the job for the paycheck and the health insurance, and it turned into 'Sharknado.' I couldn't have played this better if I'd wanted to. It's really captured the imagination of sci-fi fans.","David Hasselhoff is awesome.","Bo Derek was wonderful to work with.","For me, to get to play an action hero in a science fiction film is a marriage of two genres that I'm a huge fan of.","When I read the script for '90210,' I thought, 'Boy, this is very superficial,' and it was. I mean, the pilot was all about the glitz and the glamour of Beverly Hills, the obnoxious kids, and the fish-out-of-water story of Brenda and Brandon Walsh. I couldn't discern from that first script that the show would become very issue-oriented.","I was 28 years old playing a 16-year-old. I just kept my mouth shut. I never talked about it.","In this business, it's important: if you consider yourself a journeyman actor like I do, you need to stay topical. So I'm always looking for projects that are challenging, that put me in a light that's different from anything I've ever done before.","I look at myself more as really an entertainer. Yes, I act, but there are other things that I can do.","Everyone wanted to be eaten. It seems like it's a badge of honor to have that on your IMDb account when it says, 'Man No. 2 eaten in 'Sharknado.'","In the entertainment industry, there remains one constant: change.","I feel blessed: having a family is something that I've always wanted. Having a second child is the realization of a dream come true.","I have a lot of irons in the fire.","When I got the call from Chippendales, my jaw dropped, as it came on the heels of TMZ calling me fat on national TV. I am passionate about health and fitness, so I've kept in shape, and dancing is something I've always enjoyed, so I figured, why not?","As an actor, you know that every act has a closing curtain.","I'm always looking for additional revenue streams.","I'm a real lucky guy. I've got a fantastic woman; she's a fantastic mom and an ideal partner. She understands what I do, and she's OK with it, and I couldn't be more in love.","I never envisioned that I would be able to bring something to the entertainment table that would fit Las Vegas. Vegas is so presentational; it's live theater and, for me, it's always been film or television, which isn't why people come to Las Vegas. So it's exciting to be apart of all of this, the thrust of the entertainment of Vegas.","As an actor, I get my insurance from the Screen Actor's Guild by union, and you have to make so much every year to get that type 1 insurance.","Being a dad is the best role I've ever played, with all due respect to Steve Sanders. It really is the best thing ever.","I have two children of my own; I can't imagine anything more horrific than to have a child suffering with EB.","Dancing isn't easy, and to just jump into three to four hours of rehearsals a day is a lot.","I can't walk down the street anywhere in the world without being stopped. It can be an interruption, but on the whole, it's flattering.","I treat auditions as if they are gold. I try to make every one count.","I get fan letters written in everything from crayons to lipstick.","The weirdest request I got was for a picture of me naked with nothing on but my cowboy boots. Needless to say, she went home empty-handed. I have, however, on several occasions, strolled around my apartment in nothing but my cowboy boots. There was just no one there to take pictures.","You have to be careful of social climbers. There are a lot of potholes out there.","I don't want to make any mistakes. My parents have been married for 40 years. I want to stay married.","As a father and a provider, no stone goes unturned.","There was such mass appeal for 'Sharknado.' It went over so well - not just here in the United States but globally - that it would be such a missed opportunity and a ripoff for the fans not to bring 'Sharknado' back.","I've managed to catch lightning in a bottle a couple times. I'm very lucky. But I want to do this forever. I enjoy it so much. One of the challenges as an actor is to stay relevant.","People spend hundreds of millions of dollars to make movies that don't do anything. I mean, no one's talking about 'Pacific Rim' today. No one's talking about 'The Lone Ranger,' and those were $100 million movies that didn't have nearly the impact that 'Sharknado' did.","With 'Sharknado,' they've got a great mix of TV and film. This is a film that has film impact in the TV medium.","Major motion picture studios spend hundreds of millions of dollars trying to capture some of whatever it is that makes our little 'Sharknado' movie globally popular.","When I read the first 'Sharknado' movie, I thought it was terrible. I told my wife that I couldn't do this movie, that it would be the end of my career.","I am an actor, but my most important job is provider of my family.","I would love any opportunity to work with my former castmates again.","It's 'Sharknado,' people. No one's expecting a tear-jerking, gut-wrenching emotional piece. This is just wild sci-fi action/adventure at it's finest. It's one of those dopey movies that come on in the middle of the night, and your eyes just stay open watching it 'cuz your glued to it, 'cuz you're just compelled to continue to watch it.","There's all these summer blockbusters out there, but nobody's talking about them... they're talking about 'Sharknado.' It's amazing!","With all the cable and Internet channels you have available, you have so much opportunity. If you want to say something, you can say it and have people see it.","When I read the scene where I'm actually chainsawing my way out of the belly of a shark, how could a guy turn that down when that's in the job description?","Leg day is my favorite day. You can't have a thorough leg workout without feeling completely spent. It's a challenge, but the benefits of maintain muscle mass on my legs is important because, as the biggest muscle group in the body, it also helps me keep the proper body composition in terms of fat to muscle ratio.","Ideally, it would be five days a week, spending at least an hour at the gym doing cardio three of those days and resistance training all of those days. My cardio is typically interval training.","I can't tell you the deluge of images that were sent to me through all the different social media platforms of families partying together... enjoying 'Sharknado.'","We have so many foreign fans, I think we should take the movie to them. I thought, 'Wouldn't it be great, instead of demolishing a city, if we, through a 'Sharknado,' could rebuild it? Wouldn't it be fantastic if we went to Italy and a 'Sharknado' straightened the Tower of Pisa?'","We're very sure to stay in character, to experience the Sharknado as though it was real. That's what acting is.","We've shown the entertainment industry what social media is capable of doing for a movie. 'Sharknado' is now a noun.","Anything I can do to raise awareness and money for charity, I like to do.","The brilliance of 'Sharknado 2' is it's more of the same - similar formula, more of the experience.","I just try to do the best job I can with what I'm given. My main focus is the work and not the glamour.","Before 'Dancing with the Stars,' I'd directed a short called 'Man vs. Monday' that I sent out to all the festivals just to show I can direct and produce. It was also a template to launch a movie or a TV series.","When all the other kids were playing sports after school, I wanted to sing and dance and act.","My mom was always so supportive; she enabled me to pursue my dreams. I danced on Broadway as a kid, and she would never miss a show.","'Dancing With the Stars' has become a phenomenon, and when I look at that type of reality show, it's like a variety show."],"Ibrahim Babangida":["Our approach to economic development must be modern, focused and in tune with the global trend.","Debate and divergence of views can only enrich our history and culture.","For as long as our people are held hostage by controllable socio-economic forces, we cannot afford to be indifferent to the ravages of poverty in all its dimensions and ramifications.","The reason is that till date, in spite of advances in information technology and strategies of information, the written word in the form of books still remains one of humanity's most enduring legacies.","Democracy opens new vistas and opportunities. We should use the opportunities it offers to correct past mistakes not to blunder anew.","The average Nigerian person has come to reconcile himself with the fact that his or her social progress remain essentially in his or her hands in collaboration with other fellow Nigerians and not merely relying on what government alone could provide for him or her.","Even now, we make no apologies for the choice we made. The sacrifices we made were selfless. The options we offered were patriotic while the paths we chose were well thought out.","A society that does not correctly interpret and appreciate its past cannot understand its present fortunes and adversities and can be caught unawares in a fast changing world.","There are no doubts that, the situation in the country today, indicates that there is much more work to do in the process of reforming the political economy and improving the quality of life of our people and communities.","At the same, we need to remain sensitive to the reality that we are still an African society in which the majority of the people and communities live under severe deprivations and afflictions that are no fault of theirs.","The work of Nigeria is not complete for as long as there is any one Nigerian who goes to bed on empty stomach.","There is also work to do in the evolution of a stable family life and values, and in ensuring that the Nigerian family is built on core values that will form the bedrock of the future society. We must showcase the ideals of family life and be models of family values.","But no nation can base its survival and development on luck and prayers alone while its leadership fritters away every available opportunity for success and concrete achievement.","Each one of us, and, indeed, all those who aspire to national leadership must bring their own visions, views and styles to the business of reforming Nigeria, and the search for solutions.","I believe that historians and analysts of historical events need the authority of facts supplied by living witnesses to the events, which they make their subject.","If you ask me to summarise our mission, I would put it this way: We were a military regime that sought to lay the foundations for freedom and liberty in a complex society.","Informed by our sad experience of history, we require nothing short of a foundation for lasting democracy.","It is of course the nature of historical contraction that the shortest distance to a historical destination is never a straight line.","It is only through books that we partake of the great harvest that is human civilization across the ages.","Most importantly, nothing has happened to change my conviction that freedom and the love of liberty remain the essential defining attributes of our national character as a people.","Our choice of a reform framework dictated that we looked at the fundamental assumptions that had driven Nigeria's economy, society and policy hitherto and to seek ways of either abandoning or transcending those assumptions and their supporting institutions.","The challenge as we saw in the Nigerian project was to restructure the economy decisively in the direction of a modern free market as an appropriate environment for cultivation of freedom and democracy and the natural emergence of a new social order.","The history of our country is not the history of any other country in the world which is either practicing advanced democracy or struggling to lay the foundation for democracy.","The return of democracy in our land has indeed thrown the problems of development into bolder relief.","To meet the expectations of the majority of our people, and to open up new vistas of economic opportunity so that the aspirations of Nigerians can stand a fair chance of being fulfilled in a lifetime, there must be a truly committed leadership in a democratic Nigeria.","We have established a new basis in our country in which economic liberalization would continue to flourish alongside democratic forces and deregulated power structure.","With each new book, the march of our national history takes a step forward. When one is present at a book launch, one is bearing witness to the birth of a new body of ideas, to the coming into being of another testimony of history.","I am not sure that you, the younger generations, will like to go to war that we went through. So, we learn as the mistakes are being committed.","Left to me, the whole purpose of government is for the security of the citizens, like the security of lives and property."],"Ibrahim Hooper":["Making a donation is the ultimate sign of solidarity. Actions speak louder than words.","One has to wonder what Donald Trump will say next as he ramps up his anti-Muslim bigotry. Where is there left for him to go? Are we talking internment camps? Are we talking the final solution to the Muslim question? I feel like I'm back in the 1930s.","When there's no push back against Islamophobic rhetoric, people see that as tacit endorsement of anti-Islamic rhetoric.","We've always had anti-Muslim bigots, but they've always been at the fringes of society.","As forces of hate in this country and worldwide try to pull Muslims and Christians apart, we are in desperate need of a unifying force that can bridge the widening gap of interfaith misunderstanding and mistrust. That force could be the message of love, peace, and forgiveness taught by Jesus and accepted by followers of both faiths.","I wouldn't want to create the impression that I wouldn't like the government of the United States to be Islamic sometime in the future. But I'm not going to do anything violent to promote that. I'm going to do it through education.","What is a Muslim neighborhood? How many Muslims have to be in a neighborhood before it becomes worthy of checking papers and kicking in the doors of homes and businesses?","Any faith of more than 1.6 billion people is going to have some of them who falsely justify actions on that faith.","Whenever some kind of mass shooting or any other kind of violent activity takes place, we kind of hold our breath until we are sure that no Muslim was involved, because we know that these incidents will be treated differently if a Muslim is involved versus if somebody of another background is involved.","I believe Saudi Arabia is the only Muslim country in which churches are prohibited.","We condemn any kind of abuse of Muslim women or women anywhere in the world.","Some media outlets refer to 'protesters' and 'militia members,' not 'terrorists,' even though armed antigovernment extremists seizing federal property and expressing a desire to kill and die is a textbook description of domestic terrorism.","Even though the moniker 'Vanilla ISIS' is tongue in cheek, it is a reminder to avoid constantly framing the concept of terrorism through an Islam-centric lens.","A 2014 survey found that 74% of law-enforcement agencies reported antigovernment extremism as one of the top terrorist threats. Just 3% of those agencies viewed the threat from Muslim extremists as severe.","Researchers looked at news programs on major broadcast and cable networks between 2008 and 2012 and found that of those labeled as domestic terrorists, 81% were identifiable as Muslims - this despite the fact that FBI reports from the period studied revealed that only 6% of domestic terrorist suspects were Muslim.","Unfortunately, violent events and hate-filled rhetoric around the world provide ample opportunity for promoting religious hostility.","The Prophet Muhammad himself sought to erase any distinctions between the message he taught and that taught by Jesus, who he called God's 'spirit and word.'","Disrespect toward Jesus, as we have seen all too often in our society, is very offensive to Muslims.","We've seen a tremendous rise in the level of anti-Muslim bigotry in our society - and against minorities of all kinds - but we've also seen a tremendous rise in support.","Silence on the part of public officials at the national level only serves to empower Islamophobes.","There's a sense of being under siege in many Muslim communities. People just assume there are agents or informants in their mosque now. It's a fact of life.","We are strong supporters of First Amendment rights, and we believe free speech is a two-way street. While anyone is free to be an anti-Muslim bigot, on campus or off, CAIR is free to challenge their bigotry by speaking out against the promotion of hatred and intolerance.","As mainstream religious leaders of different faiths get together, it strengthens the voice of moderation."],"Ibrahim Rugova":["During these two and a half years that have followed the war, the most urgent problem we have encountered was: to activate the public enterprises, to bring them up to the level that international markets demand and we are just now getting them prepared for privatization.","My vision is to have an independent Kosovo, democratic, with a politically tolerant society and with a solid economy, integrated into the EU, the NATO and to continue with our good relations with the USA.","Serbia did not want to recognize our country in a peaceful way, so that is why they wanted to destroy us. All our efforts to find a peaceful solution were impossible. In order to save the people, NATO had to intervene.","So as far as Serbia is concerned, it does not have the right to influence the privatization or to claim any property, because Kosovo is a former member of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.","I want to emphasize the fact that the independence of Kosovo should and will be recognized.","Kosovo is a small country but it also has a lot of riches that were granted to us by God.","As the president of Kosovo, I am more concerned about the current situation with the employment standing at around 70 % of the population, which is young, with great potential, speaking many foreign languages and having wide expertise.","As you see the political problems are closely connected with the economical problems. With the help of politics, we will open the way for the economy and this is why all these problems are included in the program of the newly elected government.","First, we will focus on the privatization of small and medium sized enterprises, followed by the medium size industry and then we will move on to the heavy industry.","However, we still have the problem of free travel and movement, since the Travel Documents issued by UNMIK as the substitute to passports, are not fully recognized yet by all countries.","Kosovo today is closer to Europe than other countries in the region of South Eastern Europe.","My vision is that our country should be integrated in the EU, to transfer a part of our independence there. It is also our duty to do it, if we want to establish trade and a sound economy. This is the vision that I am working on and I will continue to work in the future.","Our government is ready to guarantee their investments for them, and then we will create tax incentives. We are interested in having all these things and with the privatization we also want to create more jobs and better conditions for the workers.","The different Ministries have to work more on the promotion of the country, to build Kosovo's public image. Concrete projects must be assembled, in order to activate our businessmen to have more contacts. We have to create a positive image about ourselves.","The privatization law draft was recently released and I believe that very soon we will start applying it, of course taking into consideration the provisions of UNMIK (United Nations Mission in Kosovo).","There will be a lot of competitive and strong companies coming here and even though Kosovo is a small country that undoubtedly has a lot to offer to global trade; one of our main interests is to expose it to the world market.","Today, our economy is divided: fifty percent is the public economy and fifty percent is the private economy that includes small companies employing from 4 to 200 workers.","We had a lot of international help especially from the EU and USA, which helped us to get out of this phase of emergency, to give some dynamism to Kosova.","We have the EURO as a currency, which means a lot. It has not just stabilized the situation in Kosovo politically and economically, but also facilitated the direct contact that we have with Europe.","We have used the presence of UNMIK, as well as other European and American agencies to establish a legal framework compatible with the European Union and that is already an advantage. We have seen the positive effects of this and our parliament will continue to go this way.","I built Kosovo for 10 years."],"Ice Cube":["I think, to me, reality is better than being fake.","Don't worry about being a star, worry about doing good work, and all that will come to you.","I think rap music is brought up, gangster rap in particular, as well as video games, every other thing they try to hang the ills of society on as a scapegoat.","I do what I do. You like it, great. You don't, go listen to somebody else. I'm stickin' with the people who stuck with me.","I think the worst thing you can do about a situation is nothing.","We're in this entertainment business really to give the audience what they want.","Gangsta to us didn't have anything to do with Al Capone and stuff like that. It's just about living your life the way you want to live it. And you're not going to let nothing stop you.","I used to love to draw. I didn't want to go to art class because I felt that would be too corny when I was young, but architectural drafting was the cool thing to do because there was more precision. It taught me a lot about building and structures and doorways and frames and windowsills.","I make a mean cup of coffee, if you give me the right ingredients.","I think I'm unique to the game 'cause of my versatility.","Rap is just somebody getting something off his chest. That's all it is.","Sports without music is just a game. Music makes it entertaining.","I think reading is important in any form. I think a person who's trying to learn to like reading should start off reading about a topic they are interested in, or a person they are interested in.","Truth is the ultimate power. When the truth comes around, all the lies have to run and hide.","I love music. It's freedom, a way to deal with pent-up frustration.","I have a really beautiful life right now, so there is no reason to be hostile. I'm a husband, a father and a man who tries to do the right thing in life and in my work.","I never get tired of 'It Was A Good Day' references or jokes or anything like that. It's just, you know, keeping my biggest hit alive. Nothing wrong with that.","The thing is with hip-hop, it has its waves and the waves crash against the beach and the new waves come in. So to stay relevant you have to roll with that.","If you think about stuff that happened when you were young, it stays with you forever.","Anything that got to do with a pig, I ain't eatin'.","I have a lot of milestones that I'm proud of when it comes to music, 'Amerikkka's Most Wanted,' I'm extremely proud of that. Just because of what I had to go through to get that music produced, that album produced.","Young people are dying for no reason all over the world that don't know why. It's ugly, everywhere.","I used to game a lot, you know, back in the day. My gaming time done got so short that my skills ain't where they need to be to be online, you know what I'm saying? I just got that Xbox One. I gotta get my skills back, up the par to call myself a gamer.","I have great people, smart people that are around me and we love the challenge. I guess it's like climbing a mountain or building a building. It's a challenge but you love every challenge that it brings or presents itself.","South Central is just who I am. Even though I have a nice house, nice family, the rest of my generation is still in South Central L.A. My cousins, my brothers, my sisters, they don't wanna move out.","I been all around the world and I haven't found a city that I'd rather be from or rather come back to than Los Angeles.","I'm a B-boy at heart. I still like rhyming. It's just the radio game is like Chinese arithmetic. It's hard to know what nuts to crack. But I still love music, been dropping music. Never stopped, really.","It's funny how people who ain't never been down there can think that America is so fair and that we should be alright. It's funny that the people who have their foot on our neck are telling us, 'Get up. What's wrong with you?'","Sports without music, it's nothing but a game. Music adds the emotion.","I'm trying to cut down a little on eating, on sodium, keep my blood pressure down, which is tough. Because I love food! I do, but it's unfair how everything that's bad for you tastes so good, and all the good stuff, veggies and green things, doesn't match up.","What I learned from architectural drafting is that everything has to have a plan to work. You just can't wing it. I can't get all the materials I need for a house and just start building. Whether it's a career, family, life - you have to plan it out.","I've been caught in parachute pants. And on my high school yearbook, they used the wrong picture. They were supposed to use the picture of me with a nice suit on. They used me with my collar flipped up, in a fuchsia and white striped shirt. I blame Prince and Michael Jackson in the Eighties for that.","I don't get nothing but love. In every ghetto all over the world. Nothing but love. They respect that I came outta there and I'm doing it the right way. You can't do nothing but respect that.","'Boyz-n-the-Hood' was actually supposed to be written for Eazy's group. He had a group out in New York called Home Boys Only, called HBO. One of them looked like LL Cool J. Eazy wanted to write a song for them, a street song, like what we were doing on the mix tapes. So when I wrote it, it was too West Coast for them.","The best thing I've done with my money is buy a house for my family. You wake up to a house you love and you feel like somebody.","Doing it your own way, not having to go exactly by the book to be successful.","Don't get a movie confused with real life. I'm a well-rounded human being like everyone else.","But with rap music - not just N.W.A. - but rap music in general, seeing these artists wearing these team logos all the time started bringing a synergy and energy about having to rep your city, your team, everywhere and all the time.","You like a woman, she's got kids, it's a package. You can't just go in one-sided.","Ice Cube is the piece of me that I give away to the public.","The moral is that a career can be gone in an instant. And all you have in this world are the people you love.","Music is where I have the most creative freedom, but I love producing. To me, that's kind of where all the action is. You get a chance to have your hands in every aspect of a film. From picking a director, sometimes picking a writer, to the actors, the wardrobe, set design, editing, music, and marketing.","It never gets old. Working with somebody like Kevin Hart is rejuvenating in a lot of ways. He's such a pro. He's so good.","South Central is just who I am.","I am only 33, I've got a lot to do. This is the first half of my career. I'm looking forward to the future and I'm proud about the past.","There's a lot of talent in South Central L.A., in Compton and Long Beach and Watts, and the city north of Pico pretty much sits back and waits for that talent to emerge and then steps in.","When I did 'Boyz N The Hood', I never thought how we grew up in South Central was interesting enough for a movie.","Rap is always evolving. It's easy for the old school to hate the new school, but it's a music that got a little stifled I think, by the Internet a little bit.","I go light on breakfast. Sometimes it's a yogurt, but a lot of times it's leftovers from one of my wife's dinners.","I never was in the Nation of Islam... I mean, what I call myself is a natural Muslim, 'cause it's just me and God.","My son, O'Shea. He looks like me, and he can rhyme.","I believe how you measure a good movie is how many times you can see it. With comedies, I like to be a producer, because comedies can get corny and go off track real fast. I'm always the 'less is more' guy when it comes to a scene. So I'ma be the one who will keep it grounded.","Snoop Dog is the Phil Jackson of youth football coaches. He ain't going to accept nothing but a winner.","I still enjoy doing music. I'm not going to stop doing it, and doing it the way that I feel it should be done.","I was a very interested arts student, I was always into that part of school and when I got into high school I went into architectural drafting. It gave me an understanding of how to build things and it's really helped me put things in perspective. With my music and my movies, to me it's all art.","There's never really been a real hood Christmas movie.","I was ready to get out of the box and play something a little different than what everybody has seen.","I've got a basketball signed by all the greats from Julius Irving to Oscar Robinson. It was at an All Star game I got them all to sign it. So that ain't going nowhere. I'm going to die with that in my casket.","For me rappers and dancers are poets and artists and often times the most interesting performances are given by them.","The silver and black may have another home, but the Raiders will always belong to the people of Los Angeles.","I really appreciate family. I really can't imagine life without them!","I'm just an entertainer, man. I don't like to pigeonhole myself to anything. I love to do it all.","You don't wanna mess up what you've done. It's like Jordan coming back: You're scared to mess up the legacy.","I love any time you can enlighten people to mistakes, that's how I started my career.","Even though I have a nice house, nice family, the rest of my generation is still in South Central L.A. My cousins, my brothers, my sisters, they don't wanna move out. They don't want to and they don't have the means to sustain it. That's where my heart is and that's what I think about all the time.","I'm not the type of actor who is trying to do a whole bunch of different stuff, you know what I mean?","I remember wishing there was snow in L.A. And how jealous we used to get of those Christmas specials with kids playing in the snow.","Our records, if you have a dark sense of humor, were funny, but our records weren't about comedy. They were about protests, fantasy, confrontation and all that.","There's a lot of potential that goes unused in places like South Central L.A., a lot of brilliant, smart people who just don't have that chance to show it.","Sometimes when you're relegated to your neighborhood, you forget that there's more important things than your neighborhood going on out in the world.","Early in my career, people wanted to hear music about protest, about trying to change things.","Music has done a lot to enhance the emotions of sports. It's played in arenas. Whenever there is footage cut together they're always using music. And it goes together, you know.","I definitely support cop acting more than cops, but all of them ain't bad, just some of them.","I wake up at 5:30, 6 in the morning, but don't head into the office right away. I like to hang out with my wife, talk about things, get some coffee, you know.","When I was in N.W.A. and didn't get paid all the money I was owed, that's when the business side of showbiz hit me.","When people see the Cubevision logo, they should know it's something good, something worth checking out.","My worst ever car was a green Datsun B210, back when they called it 'Datsun' - now it's 'Nissan.' Very unsexy, unattractive. Girls hated the car. I was embarrassed to even be in it... but it was my transportation.","Twerking has to end. Not for the ones that look good doing it, but for all the ones that you feel, 'You don't have enough to twerk back there. Your twerkin' look like jerkin.'","Quincy Jones' autobiography 'Q' is very good. Because he's a master at music, he's one of our greatest composers, and its good for him to have a book and tell the good ole days when he was with Duke Ellington, Count Basie, Sarah Vaughan and Ray Charles.","Some people have a taboo about doing advertising in the States. You know, where they kind of make their bread and butter. But to me, that's crazy.","It's not like I'm the first man ever to do this, y'know? You gotta go back to Nat King Cole, Bing Crosby and Sammy Davis Jr. Those are people who've done music well and movies well, and y'know, Frank Sinatra and Elvis and all these dudes have made the transition. I don't know about Elvis, 'bout doin' 'em good, y'know? It's nothin' new.","My grandmother worked at one of those Bel-Air mansions, and we would go - not too often, but every now and then - to pick her up. Hollywood was probably 12 miles from my house, but it might as well have been a million miles away. The only time I saw that world was on TV. Until I started making records.","Obama reminds me of the black kid at a white school that don't nobody want to play with.","I'm not really into the political game as far as paying politicians and stuff like that, I'm not into that. You do your job, and I'll do mine.","My son Darrel could recite 'Straight Outta Compton' at two years old. He loved it! You can expose your kids to anything as long as you sit there and explain it to them.","If it was all about me, I'd do a whole lot of pop records, make a whole lot of money, just rake in the dough. But it's never been all about me. It's all about being a voice for the voiceless. People who can't speak for themselves, who don't have a mic, don't have a say.","I'm not actually from Compton - I'm from South Central Los Angeles, and my father still lives in the same house I grew up in, so I'm there all the time.","I never was in the Nation of Islam... I mean, what I call myself is a natural Muslim, 'cause it's just me and God. You know, going to the mosque, the ritual and the tradition, it's just not in me to do. So I don't do it.","I've done movies for certain reasons; I did 'Anaconda' because the black man lives. Simple. The black man isn't dead in the first three pages, like Jurassic Park. It's like, 'The black man kills the snake with a Latino girl? Damn! I got to do this.'","I did 'Are We There Yet?' because I wanted to do a movie for my fans' kids. Black kids don't really see movies on this budget for them, starring them. And there's so many white kids that love that movie.","With film, I have to be a team player; it's a whole different thing. I can't just be a one-man show. I have to learn how to use people to the best of their ability and motivate them to be as passionate about the project as I am.","Can't step from one movie set to the next. Only Samuel L. Jackson can do that. All us mere mortals can't do that!","My thing is, I know kids cuss, they do their thing, but I tell my kids, 'Don't do it in earshot of any adults, or you're in trouble.'"],"Ice T":["Redemption just means you just make a change in your life and you try to do right, versus what you were doing, which was wrong.","A good emcee will rhyme a lot of different ways. Don't limit yourself.","I think the most successful are the most paranoid. The first thing people do when they buy a mansion is they build the biggest wall you could possibly build around it. What happens is, now you become a target. If I go into the hood, I'm at a disadvantage. They could carry guns. I can't. They can hit me in the face. I can't.","I'm just disillusioned with the hip-hop sound right now. It's too materialistic. You know, I'm the kind of guy ... I can't do that. If you track my movement, you'll never see a picture of me with any girl that wasn't mine, or my own car. My jewelry, my clothes. What kind of gangsta rapper has a stylist? A stylist?!","AIDS is such a scary thing and it's also the kind of thing that you think won't happen to you. It can happen to you and it's deadly serious.","You can't come out on a record dissing the system and be on a label that's connected to the system.","The right to bear arms is because it's the last form of defense against tyranny.","I've never been competitive with anybody but myself.","A lot of the younger kids now can rap, but they're scared of the crowd. Mastery of that stage is an MC. I don't know if you've seen any great MCs on stage but when you do it's like wow, this is more than the words to rhymes.","If you're really a rapper, you can't stop rapping.","Being cool is when you win, you don't get too happy; and when you lose, you don't get too mad.","As long as I'm around the cats in the hip hop scene, they'll throw me a track and I'll write a rap over it.","You have to come in on a professional level to make it, otherwise you just can't get into rap.","So you don't have to take us too seriously; I mean, we're already intimidating enough on stage.","I think men, growing up, you have to go through some form of hardship. You've got to harden the metal.","I think that men need to have a little bit of manism. You have feminism. I don't have a problem with that.","I make an effort to keep it as real as I possibly can.","Every once in a while, I hear somebody call me Tracy to try to let me know that they know me, you know, personally. But most of my real friends will call me Trey, or 'Ice' was basically short for Iceberg. So they would call me - some of my boys call me Berg.","The best way to listen to the album is to put it on, get some Moet, lay back with your boys, and kick it.","Los Angeles is a microcosm of the United States. If L.A. falls, the country falls.","The next day, I got a phone call from him and he told me to come and read for a movie called New Jack City. So I went over there and they told me I was gonna wear dreads and play a cop.","I've never read for a movie, I've always been given them.","So from an actor's perspective, you really have no idea how you're acting.","As an actor, you can do what you want with your role. That's why they hire you; to take the role and make it real.","If it sells, it sells. If it doesn't sell, I'll go make a movie.","I'm a big fan of all styles, even Biggie and Wu-Tang, but I gotta do my thing.","I want to be able to say that a rap career could be ten albums.","Everything we do helps the new artists in the long run.","I'm competitive in that I would like to outsell my last record.","I'll never sell 14 million like Hammer, I just wanna do a good Ice-T show.","I'm on the front line and I am a rapper.","Any New York group can come to L.A. and sell out every show, but an L.A. group who goes to New York might not do the same because the audience hasn't been introduced to the group.","I ain't got no beef with east coast, I think it's just being hyped up.","I don't have to put out another rap record. I can do it at my casual pace.","I'm at a point where I don't have to wait for the income from the record to survive, so I'm in a comfortable zone, but I'll make rap records as long as I feel I have something to rap about.","When I first got into the rap game, I had an early dream of unifying rappers.","We have groups that do that, but I can't rap with the mentality of an 18 year old when I'm in my 30's.","I have to grow with my audience.","Well, I am very happy that I was able to play a part in bringing music from the streets onto the radio and into modern culture, I worked very hard and always believed in the sounds I was creating.","Ultimately I am happy that everybody is embracing hip hop and the sounds from the streets.","Oh man, nobody is as tough as Mr T. Ice T is pretty tough though as well.","I mean rappin' to me is easy, it's something you can do over a week.","When you start a business, go for the lowest hanging fruit.","If somebody wants to kill people, they don't need a gun to do it.","I started rapping before anybody had ever bought a car from it. It was truly about the art form and the culture, more so than now, where it's a successful way to make money. Back then you had to be doing it because you liked it.","Military is a great place for a jock. That's the first thing they test you, they test you physically. If you can run, if you can do the pushups, it's not as hard a transition. If you can't do that, you're going to have a problem because they're going to really work it out of you or work it into you.","The music led to the acting. But movies aren't something you can just will yourself into. Someone has to choose you, and you have to be quite fortunate to be chosen.","If I do a song where I'm angry, when it's time to perform it live I'm not mad, I'm happy. I'm at a concert. But I have to somehow drum up that rage. That's acting.","Hollywood has its own way of telling stories. I was just telling stories that I was familiar with. And it's what I want to do in the future: I want to take my audio cinema and put it on the screen.","No, I'll stay Ice-T. This is what got me here, I'm always going to stay true to that. If it weren't for hip-hop I wouldn't be doing all these other things.","I couldn't possibly have lived all the things that Ice-T on the records lived.","Ice-T in the music has done some outrageous things.","I was born in Newark, New Jersey, and grew up in Summit, an upscale town in north Jersey. There was this tiny area of Summit where most of the black families lived. My parents and I lived in a duplex house on Williams Street.","My father's family came from Virginia and Philadelphia. He wasn't a brother who talked a lot. He was a workingman, a quiet, blue-collar dude.","My mother passed when I was in the third grade, my father when I was in the seventh, and that's when I was shipped to Los Angeles to live with an aunt.","I think everybody wants to redeem themselves after they've done something that might be considered negative. I don't think anyone wants to go to the grave negative.","I have no hatred for cops. I have hatred for racists and brutal people, but not necessarily the cops. The cops are just doing what they're told to do.","I don't feel that rap has been respected as an art form. Because people have seen rappers rap off the top of their heads, they don't think it is difficult.","Jay-Z is like a rap-savant, he doesn't have to write the rhymes down, he can create complex raps in his head. I mean he does memorize it, he just doesn't write it down on paper. He doesn't freestyle onto the track, it's all thought out.","An MC is somebody who can control the crowd. An MC is a master of ceremonies so not only can you say your rap, you can rock the party.","I started writing rhymes first and then put it to the music. I figured out I could lock it to the beat better if I heard the music first. I like to get a lot of tracks, put the track up and let the music talk to me about what it's about.","If I'm going to be a jazz player, I need to understand Miles Davis.","You have the core hip-hop, which would just be beats and breaks, more something like what you hear with DJ Premier. Then you get into the more highly produced hip-hop, which is something like what DJ Khaled does. But at some point, it starts to get kind of pop.","I think when people say 'real hip-hop,' they want it more buried in the streets. They want it more connected to the streets and the grime and the roughness of the streets. They don't want the fluff.","Most interviewers are looking for a headline. They're not skilled. They're looking for shock value.","I'm normal. I just had a different occupation for a while, and when you're in a different occupation, you have to carry yourself a different way. Most of my art is me bringing you stories from that era of my life. My life now is kind of boring.","I think L.A. radio is learning from the Bay. The Bay is a very classic place. Mac Mall, C-Bo, all that stuff, they love their artists, they're old school up there. My first big concert was playing in the Bay; I played the Fillmore.","I think, people look at me, and they say, 'You were very aggressive,' I say, 'Yeah,' you know, and I've made a better life for myself, for my son, so I should reflect that with my music now. I shouldn't still be rhyming like that; that would be me lying.","I've evolved, but I'm the same dude, I'm just in a different place. We all change, we all grow. I shouldn't be in the same place that I was 30 years ago; I should be more intelligent, you know.","My name, my real name, is Tracy. I always thought I was like a boy named Sue. So I made my friends call me 'Tray.'","I'm in a very good place to make records. Needing to make money off music is very dangerous.","When I first started out in music, I was so negative. I was knee-deep in the streets. Then my friends started going to jail. They said, 'Boy, you better start taking this seriously; you got a chance to do something with your life.' That's when I realised I had to focus. The music led to the acting.","I think singing and acting go hand in hand. Take an R&B singer: one song says, 'I love you,' the next is, 'Baby, don't leave me', the next is, 'If you leave me I don't care.' You have to drop in and out of different perspectives.","Some music comes from a real place; some music comes from your imagination. It's difficult to find out what's real and what's not, especially with the gangster stuff.","'New Jack City' was a perfect marriage of music and film. They used a lot of musicians: myself, Christopher Williams. People that were popular because of their music were given the chance to act. And the soundtrack was incredible.","Because I first made my name as a rapper claiming South Central L.A., people often assume I'm strictly a West Coast cat. But my family was actually from back East. I was born in Newark, New Jersey, and grew up in Summit, an upscale town in north Jersey.","My father was a dark-skinned brother, but my mother was a very fair-skinned lady. From what I understand, she was Creole; we think her people originally came from New Orleans. She looked almost like a white woman, which meant she could pass - as folks used to say back then. Her hair was jet-black. She was slim and very attractive.","When I was in the 12th grade, I got my girlfriend pregnant. I just got out of school, she was a 10th-grader. I'm a teen parent, and I'm at a point where I'm like, 'Man I've got to do something.'"],"Ichiro Suzuki":["You should seek approval from yourself.","If I'm in a slump, I ask myself for advice.","I've made far too many mistakes. That's the way I feel.","People striving for approval from others become phony.","I heard that in the United States the level of baseball was the highest in the world. So it was only natural that I would want to go there, as a baseball player.","The Japanese have a strong tendency to suppress their own feelings. That's the Japanese character. They kill their own emotions.","Personally, I don't like the term 'success.' It's too arbitrary and too relative a thing. It's usually someone else's definition, not yours.","The more that Japanese players go to the big leagues to play and succeed, the more that will serve to inspire young kids in Japan to want to become baseball players when they grow up.","When people get placed upon a pedestal - when they start chasing after that person on the pedestal - they become mannequin-like.","Many people have this image of me. For a long time, I cared about that.","I feel like I should be more in touch with the nuances of this game."],"Ida B. Wells":["The people must know before they can act, and there is no educator to compare with the press.","If this work can contribute in any way toward proving this, and at the same time arouse the conscience of the American people to a demand for justice to every citizen, and punishment by law for the lawless, I shall feel I have done my race a service.","Somebody must show that the Afro-American race is more sinned against than sinning, and it seems to have fallen upon me to do so.","I came home every Friday afternoon, riding the six miles on the back of a big mule. I spent Saturday and Sunday washing and ironing and cooking for the children and went back to my country school on Sunday afternoon.","The mob spirit has grown with the increasing intelligence of the Afro-American.","In fact, for all kinds of offenses - and, for no offenses - from murders to misdemeanors, men and women are put to death without judge or jury; so that, although the political excuse was no longer necessary, the wholesale murder of human beings went on just the same.","Brave men do not gather by thousands to torture and murder a single individual, so gagged and bound he cannot make even feeble resistance or defense.","The alleged menace of universal suffrage having been avoided by the absolute suppression of the negro vote, the spirit of mob murder should have been satisfied and the butchery of negroes should have ceased.","The nineteenth century lynching mob cuts off ears, toes, and fingers, strips off flesh, and distributes portions of the body as souvenirs among the crowd.","I had an instinctive feeling that the people who have little or no school training should have something coming into their homes weekly which dealt with their problems in a simple, helpful way... so I wrote in a plain, common-sense way on the things that concerned our people.","The South is brutalized to a degree not realized by its own inhabitants, and the very foundation of government, law and order, are imperilled.","Our country's national crime is lynching. It is not the creature of an hour, the sudden outburst of uncontrolled fury, or the unspeakable brutality of an insane mob.","What becomes a crime deserving capital punishment when the tables are turned is a matter of small moment when the negro woman is the accusing party.","The white man's victory soon became complete by fraud, violence, intimidation and murder.","Although lynchings have steadily increased in number and barbarity during the last twenty years, there has been no single effort put forth by the many moral and philanthropic forces of the country to put a stop to this wholesale slaughter.","The South resented giving the Afro-American his freedom, the ballot box and the Civil Rights Law.","The only times an Afro-American who was assaulted got away has been when he had a gun and used it in self-defense.","There is nothing we can do about the lynching now, as we are out-numbered and without arms.","The appeal to the white man's pocket has ever been more effectual than all the appeals ever made to his conscience.","The white man's dollar is his god, and to stop this will be to stop outrages in many localities.","No nation, savage or civilized, save only the United States of America, has confessed its inability to protect its women save by hanging, shooting, and burning alleged offenders.","The Afro-American is not a bestial race.","The negro has suffered far more from the commission of this crime against the women of his race by white men than the white race has ever suffered through his crimes.","The city of Memphis has demonstrated that neither character nor standing avails the Negro if he dares to protect himself against the white man or become his rival.","Thus lynch law held sway in the far West until civilization spread into the Territories and the orderly processes of law took its place. The emergency no longer existing, lynching gradually disappeared from the West.","The Afro-American is thus the backbone of the South."],"Ida Lupino":["You cannot play naive if you're not.","I'm mad, they say. I am temperamental and dizzy and disagreeable. Well, let them talk. I can take it. Only one person can hurt me. Her name is Ida Lupino.","Often I pretended to a cameraman to know less than I did. That way I got more cooperation.","Any woman who wishes to smash into the world of men isn't very feminine.","I'd love to see more women working as directors and producers.","A woman in show business isn't honest with herself... so how can she be honest with another woman? We are, all of us, acting every minute of the day and night.","I never wrote just straight women's roles. I liked the strong characters. I don't mean women who have masculine qualities about them, but something that has some intestinal fortitude, some guts to it.","I'd rather work all night and sleep all day... perhaps I was a mole in my last incarnation.","I didn't see myself as any advance guard, or feminist.","I had no desire to crash a man's world.","I knew it would break his heart if I didn't go into the business.","Keeping a feminine approach is vital - men hate bossy females.","Today it's almost impossible to do it unless you are an actress or writer with power... I wouldn't hesitate right this minute to hire a talented woman if the subject matter were right.","Whereupon, at the tender age of thirteen, I set upon the path of playing nothing but hookers.","Come hell or high water, adopted or my own. I am going to have, I must have some kids.","I cannot tolerate fools - won't have anything to do with them. I only want to associate with brilliant people.","I take a script and mull over it and underline the bits I want to emphasize. When I go to the set, I know exactly what I want to do.","That's one of the things I resent the most violently. To have to take your own life and give it away to the public, in pieces.","'The Sea Wolf' is the story of a man who believes only in brute force. He is so firm in belief in his own ideas that he despises all who disagree with him. He preaches the doctrine of intolerance. He flaunts the notion that democracy is anything but weakness."],"Ida Pauline Rolf":["Form and function are a unity, two sides of one coin. In order to enhance function, appropriate form must exist or be created.","An effective human being is a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts."],"Ida Rentoul Outhwaite":["There is something magical in seeing what you can do, what texture and tone and colour you can produce merely with a pen point and a bottle of ink.","I just had to plod along without having any teaching, which was a pity.","I should have been a much better artist if I could have studied more and amused myself less.","I used to find great difficulty in drawing feet."],"Ida Tarbell":["Imagination is the only key to the future. Without it none exists - with it all things are possible.","There is no man more dangerous, in a position of power, than he who refuses to accept as a working truth the idea that all a man does should make for rightness and soundness, that even the fixing of a tariff rate must be moral.","A mind which really lays hold of a subject is not easily detached from it.","The first and most imperative necessity in war is money, for money means everything else - men, guns, ammunition.","The whole force of the respectable circles to which I belonged, that respectable circle which knew as I did not the value of security won, the slender chance of replacing it if lost or abandoned, was against me."],"Idi Amin":["You cannot run faster than a bullet.","In any country there must be people who have to die. They are the sacrifices any nation has to make to achieve law and order.","I myself consider myself the most powerful figure in the world.","It's not for me. I tried human flesh and it's too salty for my taste.","I want to be remembered as a great athlete. As a boxing champion.","I am the hero of Africa.","I was a good soldier in the British Army. I was born in a very, very poor family. And I enlisted to escape hunger. But my officers were Scottish and they loved me. The Scots are good, you know.","If we knew the meaning to everything that is happening to us, then there would be no meaning.","Sometimes people mistake the way I talk for what I am thinking.","I'm a good Muslim and I'm only interested in Islam.","I love the Americans. They are my best friends."],"Idina Menzel":["I can sing 'Happy Birthday' to you in twelve different places, but one of them is going to make you feel a certain thing, maybe it's a vulnerability, maybe an innocence, maybe another way is sexy and soulful or bluesy whatever it is, but with singers, exploring keys, I think, is important.","You get to relive your childhood when you have a baby and you see these toys and these books you read when you were little - the innocence that you are able to maintain because you have to find that again in order to connect with your child keeps you in a special state of mind.","There has to be a balance between power and vulnerability. That's something I feel I have in my own life, something I struggle with and - on a good day - like about myself.","Things happen for a reason, and in their own time.","I love my husband very much. I knew it was real true love because I felt like I could be myself around that person. Your true, true innermost authentic self, the stuff you don't let anyone else see, if you can be that way with that person, I think that that's real love.","Nerves are good. They keep you alive.","I don't think I ever really knew the right words to 'Hava Nagilah,' which isn't great for a Jewish singer.","I definitely use my music to kind of alleviate my stress and get me through specific moments in time where I'm just being really tough on myself.","The truth is I love musical theater and always have.","The most successful people are so original.","I would love to play 'Funny Girl' or 'Evita,' but I idolize the women who have played those parts. I don't know if there needs to be another version of those shows.","The sky in Texas is the most amazing sky in the whole country, I think, like you can see more sky in Texas than you can see anywhere else in the world.","We are never doing anyone any favors by withholding our gifts from the world. It's scary to be fierce, but you can't compromise that for fear of losing those around you.","I'd been a wedding singer through college, but after a few years of doing my best renditions of jazz standards to clinking glasses and the sound of forks on salad, I thought, 'Oh God, if this is all I do, I'll never be able to live with myself.'","Along with enough sleep and taking proper supplements, I steam - in my steam shower. I find it's very healing, more than just your typical 'tea and honey.'","It's been a dream of mine to run my own summer camp. I went to one as a kid, and I put on productions, and got lots of confidence.","I'm smart enough to know to work with smart people.","As an artist, you have to express yourself. I make no excuses for my versatility. I grew up singing classical arias, but I love rock n' roll and jazz standards.","I always like to sing barefoot, but when I first started doing these dates with the symphonies, I of course thought I should clean up my act, being a Jewish girl from Long Island with a little bit of a trucker mouth. So I wore a gown and some high heels.","My husband and I grew up with parents who supported our passion, and we're grateful to them for that. It really helps you find your identity when you're younger. It helps you become a really well-rounded person, the more you can show from different perspectives. The arts show us empathy, which is so important.","I always like to sing barefoot.","That's what I love about songwriting - that you can write something about your own experiences and think it's completely specific to you, and then people can take away a completely different meaning for themselves. I really love that. I think you've been successful at writing a song when it has a larger life than yourself.","I have the potential to be very strong and powerful, sometimes angry, sometimes passionate. I also can be shy and withhold that because I am afraid. I don't want to freak anybody out with my passion... So I struggle with that all the time.","Who am I, if I'm not this singer with big high notes? I identify with my voice. But I'm more than just the acrobatics.","My younger sister had kids before I did, and managed to earn a master's degree while raising them as a single parent. Now she's a brilliant second-grade teacher. I'm in awe of her ability to juggle everything and still be a great mother.","I find that, maybe because I'm also a singer, I hear music in characters all the time, even if they don't sing. I hear what affects me in my heart.","My favorite thing of all time is a New York City weekend when there's a blizzard. Everything gets really quiet, and everyone goes to the movies and the park.","It's hard to absorb and to allow all that attention and accolades for 'Rent' because the rest of the country doesn't know who we are. Once I walk out of the door of 'Rent,' and I'm on the subway, it doesn't matter. It's an exaggerated sense of fame.","I'm not great at multi-tasking, so when I do one thing... I like to do it 100%.","You can't be the vulnerable, transparent, raw person required to be an artist, and then cover that stuff up and meet the world with some kind of armor on. It just doesn't go.","I've been singing since I was born. It's something I do everywhere I go. In the shower, walking down the street. I don't need any impetus to do it. I just sing.","I started working professionally as soon as I could, doing weddings and things like that in high school, while everyone else was having keg parties. I just felt destined to do it and really committed and driven; it was something that just felt right all my life.","I always use my husband's cocoa butter stuff. He has amazing skin!","As a mom, I don't have much time for beauty.","I know I'm known for singing some of those high notes, but that's really not what giving someone goosebumps is all about. It's about really trying to find what makes you unique.","They're always so serious, the orchestras, you know? It's always a fun contrast of that song and the genre of music. And me.","I would like to get another job in London or tour there. I miss my friends.","I'm a decent tennis player. Good backhand.","I'd love to open a camp focusing on the arts accessible to kids from all income brackets.","I would love to work with Matt Damon.","The first album I ever owned was 'A Star is Born.'","Everybody thinks it's going to be so glamorous, so cool, you're on 'Glee,' you know, a hit show or whatever.","My biggest project right now is trying to be a really great mom and learning how to balance family and career. I'm just trying to spend as much time with my family as I can.","People have these incredible expectations. So instead of being inspired by, say, Joni Mitchell's music, I look at it and say to myself, 'I'm going to quit - why would I think of writing or performing after listening to that?'","I used to take 40 minutes to warm up before going on stage. If you want to spend time with your child as well as having a career, you have to get up there even if your head's a mess. It's made me more relaxed, and I'm having some of my best shows.","Motherhood has helped me to stop overanalyzing things. It's been liberating because I used to be somewhat neurotic. I attribute that to having something bigger than myself.","I just enjoy being onstage and relating to the audience.","The intensity of being in front of all these incredible musicians and tremendous conductors in these elaborate halls can be overwhelming.","I'm a mom - I'm lucky if I get to shower in the morning. Luckily, nail polish stays on my toes. I've been so bad on the upkeep, though.","I think that if you're doing a new musical, you want to have the opportunity to experiment and try things without the whole city of critics looking over your shoulder.","Growing up I studied classically and did lots of shows in school.","I love working with a cast and a group of people every day, which is different than recording because you're usually pretty isolated and alone. They serve as a good balance for each other.","I sing in many different colors and, hopefully, they add up to a great performance that, after you leave the theater, makes you feel like I've really shared something of myself.","Believe me, I don't take that lightly. To have struck gold twice with 'Rent' and 'Wicked.' I know it's rare and I'm very lucky to have that kind of phenomenon in my life. They're not just great shows, they're shows that resonate with young audiences.","I like to originate new roles and characters for musical theater.","I'm trying to focus on original material. That is what I've had my luck with.","I wish I had read more and majored in literature rather than theatre. I think I would have been a better artist for it. I am trying to play catch-up now.","There are lots of things I'm acquainting myself with now to be a more well-rounded person.","As I get older, I realize all I've done is sing and act and hone those skills.","For me, 'Rent' was all about coming out of myself, finding out who I was, learning the power I could have as a performer.","A lot of my fans are young and hip and enjoy my pop album and know the lyrics to those songs as well, which is a real compliment to me.","I have a wide spectrum, a wide demographic. I have the young girls, I have the gay community, I have many regular theatergoers. I do feel a tremendous responsibility and pride to be a role model for some of these young people.","I made a good living for a teenager. And I had to learn all different kinds of music - jazz, swing, Motown, pop - and that inspired what kind of music I started to write.","I will never leave the theater. My heart is there and I love being on stage eight times a week.","I don't quite know how to put it into words, but I feel for the audience that I have; I know them.","I set the bar high because I don't want to do just any other show just to keep working. I want to do something special that means something to people and speaks to them. Those kinds of opportunities don't come along all the time!","Barbra Streisand, for one, is one of my idols. I've listened to her since I was a little kid - the first album I ever bought was 'A Star is Born' with Kris Kristofferson.","I started singing weddings and bar mitzvahs at 15, lying about my age. It was a great discipline.","If I want to tuck my son into bed and read him a story, but that means I have to take a red-eye to get to a concert - which I would never think of doing otherwise - that's just the way it is. Even if I can't hit the note that night, I got to tuck my child in!","After 'Rent,' I tried to make a record, and it didn't work out, and it was the Broadway community that welcomed me back. It's where I feel the most understood, most at home.","I keep saying, the older I get, the younger my audience gets. Because 'Wicked' and 'Rent' and 'Glee,' each one was a young audience, so it's a great thing to have, so then you know that as they get older and have kids, they'll maybe still buy tickets to my shows when I'm 80 and in Vegas!","I think as women, the smarter and more powerful we are, the more it can be threatening and alienating to other people, more than with men. That's something we need to support each other with.","Everything's always about being homogenized and following in a group. The people who stand out always have the most problems.","Being a role model is about being true to myself.","All performers get on stage because they need to feel love from an audience. I might appear confident, but those three seconds before I get out there, I'm a mess. But I have to take the risk; otherwise, I'd be miserable and would feel like I wasn't seeing through my personal destiny.","I'm more comfortable revealing myself than hiding behind metaphors. I respond to artists who reveal something of themselves.","For me, 'Rent' was all about coming out of myself, finding out who I was, learning the power I could have as a performer. And 'Wicked' was about harnessing all that strength.","I will never leave the theater. My heart is there, and I love being on stage 8 times a week.","I'm constantly trying to work on the person that I am and work on my shortcomings, and I guess I want people to know that it's ok to be a work in progress, as long as you keep trying to figure it out. But that search and that discovery is what makes life kind of rich, and it's what makes life rich... period.","'Frozen' definitely isn't about a man, but about the relationship between two sisters. At different times in our lives we find ourselves either more connected to or disconnected from the people in our family, and I think audiences will really be able to relate to that.","I tend to have a pattern of playing misunderstood characters.","With young people, I always say, 'You're not doing anyone any favours by withholding your power.' As women, we do that a lot because we are afraid of being misunderstood or perceived as too strong. But the older I'm getting, the more I realise you have to let that go.","I think I hid my singing talent from a lot of my friends at school because I didn't want to alienate anyone. If everyone was singing along in the car to a Madonna song, I didn't join in because when we're younger we're afraid of sticking out or showing off, when in fact we should own those things that make us really unique.","'Rent,' for me, was a significant time in my life because it was my first break. It was my first professional job. I also met my husband in that cast, Taye Diggs.","That experience with 'Rent' went by so fast. I was younger. I didn't even really know what opening night was. And now I'm thinking back on the times I went to Broadway as a kid and the excitement I felt... And I'm realizing that I'm actually a part of that, so I'm learning to take it in, 'cause so often I shrug it away.","The cool thing is that, unlike film, the theatre roles for women get better and better as you get older.","The more success you get, you start to be harder on yourself or more afraid of the looking glass. You have to learn to build a thicker skin because people are paying more attention.","When I lived in London when I did 'Wicked' there, everyone told me the audiences might be much more reserved, but I found it was completely the opposite. They jumped to their feet sooner, even more enthusiastically than the New York audiences did, and they were just as warm and as enthusiastic and supportive as New York.","Performing live on stage is such a community, whether it's my musicians or a cast of a show that I'm in. And then when you're in the studio or on set, it's a much more solitary experience. Both can serve me at different times in my life. And when I go back and forth from one to the other, it helps me appreciate all of them much better.","Usually I'm pretty myopic. It's hard for me to multi-task, so to speak. If I'm in a show and I'm creating a character, I'm just completely into that. It's really hard for me to do anything else like write music. I have to sort of shut down different sides of my head and just focus.","It's the face and the body and the thing that we hide inside that can keep us from the world, but my voice is my voice.","As much as I appreciate people putting me in the category of these very acrobatic belters, I feel like my strength is my... interpretation and my truthfulness with songs, and I don't want young people to think it's all about the high notes that they have to hit.","I've met so many of my idols, but the one person that has eluded me is Bono. But because he's done 'Spider-Man,' I keep thinking maybe, through a Broadway connection, somehow our paths will eventually merge.","I used to be someone that needed nine hours of sleep; otherwise, I didn't think I was going to sound good when I sang, and I was very disciplined and anal about my preparation. When you become a parent, there just isn't that time, you know?","I pretty much have no life outside of the theatre. I go home every night, and I put the TV on, and I veg out and order food.","I feel like I was born to do this... I started working professionally as soon as I could, doing weddings and things like that in high school, while everyone else was having keg parties. I just felt destined to do it and really committed and driven; it was something that just felt right all my life.","I was once an extra in a Bruce Springsteen video where they did a live performance video at Tramps. I forget the name of the song.","My story is so boring: Long Island Jewish parents take their daughters to Broadway.","For singers, I believe we can sing in a lot of keys. I know I have this big range, but the point is to find a key that emotionally connects people."],"Idries Shah":["Enlightenment must come little by little - otherwise it would overwhelm.","If you give what can be taken, you are not really giving. Take what you are given, not what you want to be given. Give what cannot be taken.","One of the tragedies of modern times is that people have come to believe that something said by someone in the past, perhaps for illustrative or provocation purposes, actually represents that person's beliefs at the time."],"Idris Elba":["I'm an ambitious person. I never consider myself in competition with anyone, and I'm not saying that from an arrogant standpoint, it's just that my journey started so, so long ago, and I'm still on it and I won't stand still.","I love to play different roles. That's just the kind of actor I am.","Not obsessed with particularly Nike, but sneakers in general. I love them.","I love bikes. I used to own one, but I fell off it when I was younger and that was the end of my bike riding days until now.","In 'Pacific Rim' I had to have a haircut I wouldn't usually rock. However, the moustache I had in the film - that might have to come out again. It was a good moustache. Good times.","I knew that if I wanted to be all I could be, I would have to go to the U.S. It took three years to get the accent right.","Yeah, I know, any time you hear an actor say, 'I do music', you cringe. But I want to be gradual with my music. I want to earn my stripes.","I'm a little sheepish about it. Whenever I meet fans and they're like, 'Oh, you're so sexy,' I just don't get that. There's no way one man can be universally sexy.","The one album I can't live without is called 'Cumbolo' by a band called Culture. Every song on their album is deep, but there's one in particular called 'This Train.' I have a tattoo of the lyrics on my left arm.","I want to go to Sierra Leone with something - whether it's some sort of contribution to healthcare, or to the entertainment industry. My cousin is a nurse; we are talking about opening a clinic.","As an actor, you're trained to do the right thing, be politically correct, say your lines, say the right thing about the people you're working with.","The only thing I change mainly is my sneakers. I love sneakers. But everything's sort of black or jeans. Jeans, always.","The adrenaline feeling of jumping out of cliffs and bikes and all of that is very specific to the film. In 'Pac Rim' I'm not doing that so much. There isn't that touch stonework for me in it, but there is a lot of action.","There's a fast-track if you can do the networking. For some personalities it works, but for mine it doesn't.","I get criticized for taking roles in films like 'Ghost Rider 2', but if you look at my resume, dude, I've mixed it up as much as I can.","I'm tactile, very tactile. A woman who has really nice, looked-after skin is such a turn-on for me. It's always sexy.","I don't get recognised that much yet in London, but when I do I get a real sense of achievement.","I was really ambitious, so I was innovative. I was one of the first DJs to do live calls, 'cause I found this phone device that would pick up other people's voices.","Because I was big, I didn't have to listen to anyone doubting me. I was just considered good at football or whatever, there were no questions about it.","Every leading lady I work with, I'll see if I can get a song out of them and put it on an album.","People expect me to be that guy. But I'm more east London boy than east Baltimore.","It's weird because my parents don't really understand my business. I get fan mail all day long, but if a piece happens to get to their house, they're like, 'Oh, my God, you've got a fan! You have to write them back. You have to do it!'","If I was gonna go to jail, I don't want to go to jail for stealing a bottle of water. I'll steal that $20 million. At least then it was worth it.","I've always been DJing; it's just I'm making more of a push for it, making it more public.","Whether it's music or acting, that creativity all comes from the same source.","I don't have a place that I call home at the moment because there's no point. I mean, I'm a traveling circus for a while. It's weird. Like, if I wanted to go home, there's nowhere to go. I just go to a hotel. But I've kind of gotten used to it.","I think 'The Wire' really is relatable. It reflects an ongoing issue across America, about inaccuracies in major cities between rich and the poor and some of the things that go on behind the red tape of council and government bodies.","When I look at my body of work, I've played a lot of characters who are morally conflicted - 'I'm right, no I'm wrong, I don't know what to do!' I want to play more characters who don't care as much, and who aren't as measured. They are what they are, no apologies.","There's the argument that you can relate to someone who's completely unrelatable. In the way that a director shows you his imagination on a film, then I get to show you my imagination in a big dumb character.","You know, film is the ultimate goal in an actor's career. I mean, I still love TV. I have my feet firmly stamped in it. But my opportunities have been bigger and better.","In some countries, no one knows who Idris Elba is.","Bond? It is a bit like saying, 'Do you want to play Superman?' Anyone would dream of it. It's one of the most coveted roles in film. I'd be honoured. But I don't know if it will actually happen. I'm just happy with the idea of being associated with it. It's nice there's a lot of good will.","It's actually quite criminal how 'The Wire' was systematically ignored.","Africans, we hold on to our youths and whip them into shape.","When I was a kid, I thought it was tough.","I wasn't bad at school, but I was never a bookworm.","The less I talk about being black, the better.","I'd rather a young black actor read about success as opposed to how tough it was. I get these roles because I can act and that's it. Hopefully that's it.","Are there differences between black actors' opportunities and white actors' opportunities? Yes, there are. It's been said.","Twenty or 30 years from now, I'm going to be on a beach in Jamaica.","The English are good at bad guys - the James Bond-style villain, cunning, slow-burning. The Americans are much more obvious about it.","The long and short of it is that I am now in a position in England to green light movies, and that's really excellent - not high-budget movies, but movies none the less.","It could be Grammy night, Oscar night, whatever - I don't feel the pressure to be there.","I was into Spider Man when I was a kid and that was the only comic I've ever read.","I tend to stay away from the comics.","Now there are certain things you have to prepare - like dialect and special skills. But in the moment, interaction between two characters on the page doesn't need - for me, I don't need to prepare that.","It was deeply important for me to understand where Mandela came from. Because we know where he was going, and that's a famous story, but who was he? Where did he come from? What was his upbringing?","I'm rebelling against being handed a career, like, 'You're the next this; you're the next that.' I'm not the next anything, I'm the first me. I can't be myself, I can't just be Idris Elba. But that's just the nature of the business.","I've always had ambition, and the acting was successful and put my name on the map, but it was never the plan to stop there.","The role of my agent has just been to get me in the room. If I can get in the room - say the character is just a charming man who lives next door - then I'll walk in there and be as charming as I can and they will think to themselves, 'I don't see why we can't cast him.'","I'm not interested in making all-black films - I come from a very diverse culture; I want to work with every type of person. I work a lot with women executives because they seem to be a lot more open minded about that and a lot more progressive in that way.","If you are going to call a film a 'black film' then you have to make a film that represents everyone that's black, which is almost impossible. That is why white films are not called white films, they are just called 'films.'","You watch yourself age and it's hard to feel like a sex symbol.","Apparently, Daniel Craig said I'd be a great Bond. Daniel, why did you say that? Dropped me right in it! What an honor it would be, but also, what an indication of change.","Sean Connery wasn't the Scottish James Bond and Daniel Craig wasn't the blue-eyed James Bond. So if I played him, I don't want to be called the black James Bond.","I was cast in 'Thor' and I'm cast as a Nordic god. If you know anything about the Nords, they don't look like me but there you go. I think that's a sign of the times for the future. I think we will see multi-level casting. I think we will see that, and I think that's good.","There has been a big debate about it: can a black man play a Nordic character?","I think there's a tendency for actors like myself, and I don't mean to generalize myself, but I've played 'men's men,' if you will, characters that are simmering rage and calculated. There's a trend not to play anything that is opposed to that.","I would never be fearful of any character.","I've been DJing mostly, and most DJs end up producing. That's just me.","I still sing on bits and pieces. Singing's something that I love to do, but it's not something that I pursue as a career.","I did a rendition of 'Billie Jean' which is on my Soundcloud. I put it on Twitter, and it got about 3000 hits that day.","I've never had to explain 'Prometheus' to people, ever. Most people get it.","It's really funny because the same people who loved me as Stringer Bell were the same people that were watching 'Daddy's Little Girls' literally in tears.","Every single film I've done, it's about the character.","Television has shied away from being too dark, because so much has happened to us recently here in the West, and people are sort of wanting to see more uplifting sorts of things.","I lived in America for a long time before I started working as an actor. Some actors show up on set and have never done an American accent before, so they rely on a slew of technical mechanisms. Part of what makes an accent is understanding why people speak that way - you have to understand the culture.","What really excites me in a project is when it goes in a way you haven't been before.","I did green screen for the first time! I wouldn't like to do a whole movie of green screen, though. You kind of forget the plot a little - like being in a Broadway play and doing it over and over and forgetting your line halfway through.","I try to fit in workouts whenever I can.","I have one of these bodies. When I was younger, I could never put weight on, and now that I'm a little older, there's a natural sort of chubbiness coming. But honestly, if I work out for a week, it drops off in no time.","I was always a real athletic kid. Then when I got older, I just figured it was part of life to keep training.","If you go to Africa and you're white, you're probably not going to get that much work either. But the fact is that there is a longer history of black integration in the U.S. I don't have any resentment about this: I did the maths, calculated it against my ambition and decided to leave England.","I was on a well-beaten path of actors - what we all call 'the Law and Order route'. I spent two years of auditioning for everything... and then 'The Wire' came up.","White actors still get way more money in Hollywood. It's been that way for a very long time. I hope it'll change, but it's a matter of forcing that change."],"Ieva Laguna":["I like to think of myself as classy.","I love Rag & Bone, Dior, and Valentino; I like feminine, sexy things. Dolce & Gabbana and Chanel, too.","I was really into my studies and wanted to be a doctor.","I never forbid myself anything.","I like Victoria Beckham - she has really good taste. Also, Natasha Poly, Miranda Kerr, and Alessandra Ambrosio. They know how to dress effortlessly sexy, but still cool.","I really want to work for myself and build a business from nowhere."],"Ieyasu Tokugawa":["Life is like unto a long journey with a heavy burden.","Forbearance is the root of quietness and assurance forever.","When ambitious desires arise in thy heart, recall the days of extremity thou has passed through.","Give the peasants neither life nor death.","Persuade thyself that imperfection and inconvenience are the natural lot of mortals, and there will be no room for discontent, neither for despair.","Find fault with thyself rather than with others.","Let thy step be slow and steady, that thou stumble not."],"Iggy Azalea":["Luxury lives in the finer details. It's a cloth napkin at a dinner table. It's a mint on your pillow before bed.","I always say: 'Share your happiness with the world, give other people that happiness and let it come back,' but some things make me question it. I don't know if I want some people to know that I am happy. I think a lot of people want to take it away from you, and that's really scary.","For me, visuals are as important as the music. I just love escapism and giving people something to escape to. To me, that's what art is.","I love purple because my name is Amethyst.","I think stupid people are surprised that I'm Australian. It's a small-minded; we live in a global community, but I suppose some people still are small-minded.","I love musk oil. There's something about musk that makes it memorable without being overpowering.","A lot of people heard 'Murda Business' and thought it was about killing people, trying to be tough and hardcore. If you actually listen to the lyrics, it's kind of silly and playful.","I was a kid watching music videos, which were so cool and made me want to learn how to dance. I wish I could've gone to dance classes and learn, like, hip-hop dancing.","T.I.'s my mentor; he's a really close friend of mine. I call him my brother like we talk on the phone all the time. He's helped me with my career.","My management team are all women. Most of the people at labels I liaise with are all women. It's pretty much all women all the time.","I always thought that there was something in hip-hop culture that was the misfit of all the musical styles, where they didn't really belong. They're kind of like, 'No, we're a real culture! We're not going anywhere, you can't get rid of us!' I really liked that there was a rebelliousness about it. I connected with that.","I'm a pretty chill and easygoing person; most people in Australia are, as well. I don't think I ever really saw a lot of fights growing up. I think it's hard to get people in Australia angry and want to fight, minus one or two people in the media... but we won't say any names.","People criticize you for trying new things. I think, 'I'm new! I'm 22!' I don't know exactly what my sound is or what I want my album to sound like, so I'm not releasing it yet. While I'm experimenting, I'll let you in on the journey, and you can hear it for free.","I'd known since about eleven that I wanted to live in America.","I naturally want to be provocative.","I'd dropped out of high school without really doing it on purpose - I'd just go home at lunch 'cos I didn't have friends, then stay there all afternoon listening to rap. It got to the point where I wouldn't have passed even if I'd gone back. I was depressed, basically.","I always felt really alone because no one wanted to talk about the things that I enjoyed, and that was really rap music and hip-hop as a culture. You know, having the shoes, using the words, buying the magazines, seeing the videos. And I had nobody to share it with, so I feel like I lived a lot online.","I think you can say anybody uses anything as a gimmick. Is Adele's not having gimmicks her gimmick? It's hard to say, isn't it? Really, I think that everybody has something that people like or that's great about them.","It's different, it's weird to say, 'She's a white rapper or she can't do this because she's this color - this color does this thing. These are the boxes we have, this is what it is, don't try to change it.' And it's crazy to me because I'm just not from that world, so I can't really rock with it all the way.","I think music talks to you on an emotional level, regardless of where you're from. I guess I related to the tempo of rap, the aggressiveness.","I think most music provides the same messages - whether it be 'I'm unhappy' or 'I love a girl.' I just liked the package of rap music.","I think that music is still art, even if it's commercialised.","I like 'Ab Fab;' I love the crazy stuff they wear. That's my favourite! I love 'Ab Fab.'","I really like 'Roar' and 'Dark Horse.' 'Dark Horse' I really like, and I feel I would sing that in the bathroom; I would buy that album, and I think Katy Perry's amazing!","We don't really watch basketball in Australia.","I think some people think I'm, like, anti-label, and I'm not. I just wanted to sign a deal when the time was right. I'm anti being shot out of a rocket when you're not ready and the songs and image aren't there.","I feel like 'Work' was a really good song for people to get to know me, as it's obviously biographical. With 'Bounce,' I wanted to make sure people know there's a fun side to me as well as the somber and serious one.","Music is art to me, and you don't censor art. You don't go into a museum and censor things.","I started rapping since, like, 14. But I've been obsessed with rap from when I was 11. I heard 'Baby Don't Cry,' I'll never forget.","My real name is Amethyst. It sounds like a stage name. My mom is kind of crazy.","I hated school so bad. I only liked art class during high school. I was always smart.","As a child, I remember my dad would sometimes drive me into town with him to play pinball machines together. It's a bittersweet memory but also a favorite.","I'm irrational about all things creative, and I'm always late!","I've never heard a man in a suit tell me what to wear; that's not their forte. You hire your stylist; whatever someone's image is as an artist is what they've chosen to portray.","Not every artist is a role model.","There's an obligation to not lead people down the wrong path, but I hardly think me wearing short shorts on stage is creating monsters.","People think I'm more wild than I am... I like going to theme parks, play sports or just hanging out with my friends.","I've been a little bit Las Vegas and casino-obsessed. So, I love some trashy glamour... and I think nothing's trashier or more glamorous than a bit of a sheer number!","They say I'm insane because I need to have so much creative control. They say I'm unmanageable, but I'm not. I just know what I like. I'm obsessed with it. If you can't control it, that's like having somebody else paint your pictures. How could you do that? I never could.","'Iggy' was my dog - he was named after Iggy Pop - and 'Azalea' is the street where I grew up; together, they have the right amount of syllables to make the perfect name.","There are many females in my life I couldn't function on a daily basis without who I've purposely put there that work with me.","I do absolutely nothing, actually, believe it or not. People will probably hate me for saying that, but I guess I'm one of those lucky horrible people who, no matter what I eat, I don't gain a pound. My whole family is just like that. They're all skinny and tall, and I guess, so am I.","As far as people whose style interests me, I'd say Grace Kelly, Gwen, Spice Girls, Victoria Beckham, and that nanny called Fran.","I didn't have cable television growing up; there were only six channels you could watch then. The only really good channel was channel 10, and they would play 'The Nanny Called Fran' every night for years. I've seen every episode 100 times. I would get my Grandma to make me leopard skin dresses on her sewing machine.","Being talked about like a package - I feel like that all the time.","I never feel with the fashion stuff that it's too fake. If I was a model and had a working part in Fashion Week, then I might feel like that, but I'm just a visitor. I really only walk in and watch the shows and think, 'Maybe I could wear that in a video.' I meet the designer, say hello, and then I go."],"Iggy Pop":["Something I like to do a lot is just sit by water when there's a current and just stare into the water. I don't fish, I don't hunt, I don't scuba, I don't spear, don't boat, don't play basketball or football - I excel at staring into space. I'm really good at that.","I have no idea why a guy would bring a jar of peanut butter to a concert.","Second only to the sea, the Miami sky has been the greatest comfort in my life past 50. On a good day, when the wind blows from the south, the light here is diffuse and forgiving.","I became Iggy because I had a sadistic boss at a record store. I'd been in a band called the Iguanas. And when this boss wanted to embarrass and demean me, he'd say, 'Iggy, get me a coffee, light.'","I try to beat back the producers and engineers so they - there's not an excess of stuff used to squeeze my voice to make it artificial. There's a person in there, and people will listen; if they hear another person speak to them, they'll listen because it's lonely out here.","I'm a little bit damaged in about 15 different ways, and it's been nice that no particular damaged area has become a major issue. I'm a more than moderately healthy 65-year-old male who has gotten away with a lot of stuff.","I stare at myself in the mirror and I think, 'Wow, I'm really great-looking.'... I think I'm the greatest, anyway.","Miami is nothing like me, and that's why I need to be here - it's the opposite. I'm practical, where this place is moody, I'm stolid in my interior, where this place has a certain flair, and I'm materialistic in a sense that this place is fundamentally spiritual - there's a quicksilver quality about this place.","I find it hard to focus looking forward. So I look backward.","My mom was a saint. She taught me to be terminally nice.","'Punk rock' is a word used by dilettantes and heartless manipulators about music that takes up the energies, the bodies, the hearts, the souls, the time and the minds of young men who give everything they have to it.","Stages are getting higher and higher, and I'm getting older and older.","I'm a travel enthusiast.","What did Christ really do? He hung out with hard-drinking fishermen.","I like semi-torn-down places where I could get nestled in and get something done without anyone bothering me.","If I don't terrorize, I'm not Pop.","Well, I don't use the toilet much to pee in. I almost always pee in the yard or the garden, because I like to pee on my estate.","When the 'godfather of punk' thing started floatin' around, it was, I was really, really embarrassed. I thought I should have a great, big rig and a cape and everything, and it was very embarrassing. And then after a while, you learn that if people call you anything, this is a great gift.","If you give a good performance, something that gets some feeling across to people, that's such a rare gift. It's underestimated at this point in history, when the music biz is inevitably turning into a kind of politics.","I like music that's more offensive. I like it to sound like nails on a blackboard, get me wild.","Look, you're here to see me, and I can't go on until my dealer is here, and he's waiting to be paid, so give me some money so I can fix up, and then you'll get your show.","She looked at me penetratingly. So I suppose you can figure out what happened next.","My parents wanted to light my artistic candle. But over time, the definition of 'the arts' began to stretch. And as I got older, they suddenly realized, Oh, my God, we're the parents of Iggy Pop.","The more walking-around money I have, the less I walk around.","Well, the stuff that has become more commercial doesn't have any edge.","I was who I was in high school in accordance with the rules of conduct for a normal person, like obeying your mom and dad. Then I got out of high school and moved out of the house, and I just started, for lack of a better term, running free.","A lot of young musicians get the money at the wrong time. They get it for something they don't feel great about, and it'll make you feel so bad it'll destroy you and kill you.","Musical types tend to combine the burden of the author with the burden of the actor.","What some people would call antics, I would just call a good show.","I have a hot memory, but I know I've forgotten many things, too, just squashed things in favor of survival.","I never believed that U2 wanted to save the whales. I don't believe that The Beastie Boys are ready to lay it down for Tibet.","Nobody understands me, I'm really sensitive.","Studios are like hospitals. A lot of people check in, and they don't check out.","The most successful stuff is sold to you as indispensable social information. The message in the music is, 'We are terribly, terribly slick and suave, and if you listen to us, you can probably get a leg up in society, too.'","The people who were learning from me tended to be more commercial performers who were gonna rip off the salient idea to do it in a way that will sell, but they weren't going for the music.","In 1965, when great young white artists in the English-speaking world were successfully re-channeling hillbilly and black music - you know Bob Dylan, Ray Davies, Pete Townsend, Keith Richards - they didn't get any money at first. They were all broke.","My general take on American music since 1969 is that it's just getting stiffer and people are getting more uptight - audience, performance, and palace guard.","When punk began to be a genre, people were going to go out and try to mine it. Some of the better groups, like the Ramones and the Sex Pistols, were very artificial.","At university, I had been obsessed with reading about the lives of Rimbaud and Baudelaire, and I was steeped in the crazy poets, and I came to view my early subjects through that prism.","Living in England was wonderfully civil and easy-going.","It's more fun to look at an old picture of me than it is to look at a new one sometimes. Although, I still wear a dress pretty well.","It's fair to say that I have a side that is prudent and a side that is not.","Basically, I'm a musical vocalist, but I do voiceover stuff as a sideline, like plumbing or something.","Miami's not anybody's poor cousin. It's an aspiration to live in this town, not something you have to do to promote yourself like some of the larger cities.","I was a pretty nice kid. Kind of quiet, but quiet in terms I wasn't going out and setting fire to anything. I had a big mouth and I was creative type, you know."],"Ignacy Jan Paderewski":["You are a dear soul who plays polo, and I am a poor Pole who plays solo.","I established a certain standard of behavior, that, during my playing, there must be no talking."],"Ignatius of Antioch":["Wherever the bishop appears, there let the people be, even as wheresoever Christ Jesus is, there is the catholic church.","I have no taste for corruptible food nor for the pleasures of this life. I desire the Bread of God, which is the Flesh of Jesus Christ, who was of the seed of David, and for drink I desire His Blood, which is love incorruptible.","Let not then any one deceive you, as indeed you are not deceived, inasmuch as you are wholly devoted to God.","Take heed, then, often to come together to give thanks to God, and show forth His praise. For when you assemble frequently in the same place, the powers of Satan are destroyed, and the destruction at which he aims is prevented by the unity of your faith.","I would rather die and come to Jesus Christ than be king over the entire earth. Him I seek who died for us; Him I love who rose again because of us.","I prefer death in Christ Jesus to power over the farthest limits of the earth. He who died in place of us is the one object of my quest. He who rose for our sakes is my one desire.","Now I begin to be a disciple... Let fire and cross, flocks of beasts, broken bones, dismemberment... come upon me, so long as I attain to Jesus Christ.","Only let it be in the name of Jesus Christ, that I may suffer together with Him! I endure everything because He Himself, Who is perfect man, empowers me.","There is one Physician, of flesh and of spirit, originate and unoriginate, God in man, true Life in death, son of Mary and son of God, first passible and then impassible: Jesus Christ our Lord.","You must all follow the lead of the bishop, as Jesus Christ followed that of the Father; follow the presbytery as you would the Apostles; reverence the deacons as you would God's commandment.","Even though I be bound in the Name, I have not yet become perfected in Jesus Christ.","I have many deep thoughts in God, but I take my own measure, lest I perish by boasting... For I myself, though I am in chains and can comprehend heavenly things, the ranks of the angels and the hierarchy of principalities, things visible and invisible, for all this I am not yet a disciple.","They that are of the flesh cannot do the works of the Spirit, neither can they that are spiritual do the works of the flesh, even as faith cannot do the works of unbelief, nor unbelief the works of faith.","Nothing is better than peace, by which all warfare of heavenly and earthly foes is brought to naught.","I am God's wheat, and I shall be ground by the teeth of beasts, that I may become the pure bread of Christ.","May nothing entice me till I happily make my way to Jesus Christ!

I just happened to stay here then.","I really didn't intend to be a musician when I left Japan.","The most important thing is that it's much more fun to play in a band than to be in an audience in a club. That's the main thing I think, that you can do it.","Mars is really different, into art. Lydia Lunch is more energy. James Chance is more commercial in a different way, in funk and jazz.

Any of those bands didn't last long.","Somebody gave me this drum machine and somebody else asked me to program something for a project. I really liked programming and I was really interested in using the drum machine.","Come to think of it, the way I play is like a drum machine- very mechanical.","I got tired of different drum sounds so you buy different effects for more manipulation.","So now I don't have time to practice drums.

George Washington had a copy of the book on his desk when signing the U.S. Constitution.","Latinos are learning English. That doesn't mean that they should sacrifice their original language or that they should give up this in-betweeness that is Spanglish.","Two prominent terms, 'Latino' and 'Hispanic,' refer to people living in the United States who have roots in Latin America, Spain, Mexico, South America, or Spanish-speaking Caribbean countries.","'Hispanic' was the term adopted by the government - by the Nixon government in particular - and that made the community feel it was being branded.","How many different works of art have been inspired by 'Don Quixote?'

The marriage lasted thirty years, but Cervantes may have spent only about half of them with his wife.","I have always considered it a beautiful metaphor that Cervantes had no fixed address in Spain. He is thus everywhere and nowhere. There are a number of sites connected with his life, but none attract hordes of travellers the way Stratford-upon-Avon and the Globe Theatre in London draw Shakespeare aficionados.","Disinterring famous people has become a kind of sport in the Hispanic world. Before Cervantes, it happened to Evita, Che Guevara, Federico Garcia Lorca, and Pablo Neruda.","The running joke about the Premio Cervantes, the most coveted literary prize in the Spanish-speaking world, which was established by Spain's Ministry of Culture in 1976, is that Cervantes himself wouldn't have received it.

Mexican companies are very excited.","You cannot set salaries by decree. At the end of the day, it doesn't work with the market. What you can make sure to do is to train workers in order to make them more efficient and demand higher salaries because of their qualifications.","If a private investor is raising his hand and saying, 'I don't have the conditions with which to work,' then the government has the responsibility to create those conditions.","I do believe that as the country becomes more attractive in the manufacturing sector, salaries can improve, and opportunities can expand.","NAFTA is a trilateral agreement, and it would make a lot of sense to have trilateral discussions.","The U.S. is a sovereign nation, and if the U.S. decides to build a wall on the southern border, it's their sovereign decision.

If I were Mr. Trump, I'd treat them with more respect.","I can't come back home with an agreement that will not be a win-win-win situation for the U.S., Canada, and Mexico.","You know how it is: when you politicize things, it is not the best ingredient to get things done.","You cannot have an agreement... that gives a tailor's cut, a perfect handiwork, to a specific company.","If there is any action that punishes imports to the North American market and encourages U.S. exports, you have to reflect it in a mirror action to counteract the change of incentives that this would make for activity and investment in Mexico.","The list of traceability for some automotive components needs to be rethought for new technologies to send adequate signals about the strengthening of the value chains in North America.","We are willing to consider any rebalancing as long as it's through trade expansion, not through trade restriction. As long as it's about how can we buy more from each other, we're willing to work that way.","Since we don't use any type of currency manipulation schemes - we have a floating exchange market - we are very glad to consider any type of process that would stabilize the Mexican peso.","We all know that China is not a free trader. That's the reality.","The precondition to negotiating NAFTA is that we can't go back to the past.","NAFTA, by itself, will not collapse. The possibility is that the United States leaves the treaty, but the treaty itself would keep regulating relations between Canada and Mexico.","We are fed up with complaints that Mexico is stealing jobs from U.S. manufacturing. We are part of the solution that has maintained competitiveness for the U.S. versus China.","We must ensure that decisions we make today do not come back to haunt us tomorrow.","There is no one trade agreement in the world that has country-specific content. It doesn't exist. Content has to be measured regionally."],"Ileana Ros-Lehtinen":["Rogue regimes never respond to anything less than hardball.","No matter where you are from, no matter what your background is, no matter what your socioeconomic status is, every person can achieve his or her dreams.","Hamas says in its charter they want to see a world without Israel. They want to obliterate Israel.","I believe in the promise of America. Being a Cuban refugee, having come here when I was eight, I know that this is a shining city on the hill.","In the end, it's a good investment for America to be involved in helping people get democratic governance - not to take over their country - but to help people be free. And that is an investment that will pay off in the future.","I believe the Obama administration, from the president on down, has taken a very weak position regarding granting Palestine statehood at the United Nations.","I don't just whisper it, I say it and I say it: 'The United Nations is an anti-Semitic organization, an anti-Israel organization.'","If we don't like the Human Rights Council, then let's not fund it. We should pick and choose cafeteria style which groups we want to help.","It's a special place, and I believe in the prominence of America, and having America be and continue to be an exceptional place, and making no apologies for America being a superpower.","I support strong sanctions and other penalties against those who aid violent extremists, brutalize their own people and have time and time again rejected calls to behave as responsible nations."],"Ilie Nastase":["I haven't reported my missing credit card to the police because whoever stole it is spending less than my wife.","My ambition is to do a good job. I never plan anything.","If you have confidence you have patience. Confidence, that is everything."],"Ilka Chase":["Among famous traitors of history one might mention the weather.","America's best buy is a telephone call to the right man.","Wart hogs should sue for libel. It is a terrible name and they are fine fellows and devoted family men and it is rare to see one by himself; the little woman and the kiddies are usually close at hand.","When he said we were trying to make a fool of him, I could only murmur that the Creator had beat us to it.","The only people who never fail are those who never try.","It is usually when men are at their most religious that they behave with the least sense and the greatest cruelty.","You can always spot a well informed man - his views are the same as yours."],"Illeana Douglas":["I like the idea of capturing people who aren't there to save the world.","The best situation is where they cast you and then they trust you.","I come from a pretty strange family.","When we were doing a scene, lots of times we would collapse giggling, because it seemed so silly because it felt like we were doing a home movie at times.","When I do a character, I try to base it on someone I have met or an experience I've had.","We were big Saturday Night Live and Eddie Murphy fans.","There's too much insecurity on studio sets, with all the people standing around, whispering.","It's nice to see a movie where people are actually succeeding.","It was an interesting way to come across in my first big role. To work with Robert DeNiro was very exciting.","In high school, my goal was to be a writer for SNL, then I got into the acting.","I've done a few studio films in the last few years where I feel like I've done good work, and then I only end up in two scenes. That's been very disappointing.","I'm a huge poster collector.","I'm a big fan of Albert Brooks, Nichols and May. I'd like to follow in their footsteps and do comedy films.","I wore a lot of vintage clothing. I dressed like a reporter, with a little card in my hat. I had these fantasies of who I wanted to be, so I'd dress like an explorer, a cowboy. I dressed up like Elton John a lot too. That was another period.","I want to be an animated character. I'm also doing more writing and directing.","I met Patricia Neal, John Houseman. But I loved my grandfather because he was this kind, talented man.","I loved the idea of the Nerd as Hero, which Ghost World also had.","I love sketch comedy. My real goal is to do something with Albert Brooks. That would be my fantasy. I stay up night and day thinking up stuff he might find funny.","I love anything to do with ventriloquism and magic.","I like doing movies that relate to people's experience.","I know as I'm taking my dying breath, the ambulance guy will ask me why they cancelled Action.","I had an obsession that I was male characters from movies.","I always wanted to get into the horror genre. I like scary movies. I want to go to the fan shows and sign posters with my head hanging by a thread like a B-movie actress.","God only knows what else is on the web about me."],"Illinois Jacquet":["When I got my band in 1983, I knew what I had to do. If I'm going to have a big band, they're going to have to sound equally as good as what I'm used to hearing.","The patterns of big-band music are smooth and classical. It's got to be fresh. The brass section should crackle, like the sound of eggs being dropped into hot grease.","When I was 16 or 17 I heard the Count Basie band with Jo Jones and Lester Young and Herschel Evans and I couldn't believe it. They were the greatest swing band. I really fell in love with that sound. Everybody danced!","People like to hear songs that they can dance to. Even if they're sitting, they like being made to want to dance and move. By me being a dancer, I know how I'd dance at certain tempos. I was always good at it.","Hamp would ask me about tempos in the band: 'Jacquet,' he'd say, 'knock off that tempo.' A lot of jazz musicians didn't prefer to play for dancers, which was their loss, really. But good jazz has always had that dance feel.","Their eagerness for the big-band music and their ability to grasp the essence of it made me realize that today's generation has not been properly exposed to the big-band sound."],"Ilya Ehrenburg":["You could cover the whole earth with asphalt, but sooner or later green grass would break through.","Knowledge has outstripped character development, and the young today are given an education rather than an upbringing."],"Ilya Ilyin":["I move around, like a true Kazakh nomad.","It is not easy for me to digest meat. I waste too much energy in digesting meat, and that's why I get my proteins from other products. I like beans and other legume plants very much. I need a lot of 'live' products such as fruit and vegetables.","My main goal is to become the most successful weightlifter in history.","I try not to eat anything which is too fat, and I can't eat anything which is too sweet.","I think chicken and horse meat are ideal food because it's very easy to digest.","I love my life. I love my work. I love my training. It's all due to my love for life, my love for people. I'm very happy to be alive.","I do believe food plays an important role in preparation for the Olympics or any competition.","Chicken and horse meat are the best foods for weightlifters, and good food is important.","If you have less weight, you have less strength.","The Olympics have their own unique atmosphere and energy. People might say it's just the same as any other competition, but don't kid yourself. There's a hunger for victory.","By nature, I was a little guy with big legs - a stocky lad.","I've started spending more of my time studying, trying to improve my IQ by reading and writing.

Sister Betty refused to live her life as a victim.","Grass-roots work is not flashy, and rarely celebrated on the national media level, but that is where change begins.","My mother didn't set out to surround us with white students or colleagues. My mother just sought a quality education. People have these expectations of who they think you should be. And I say it's because they don't really understand Malcolm X - or his wife.","We have been shaken by the deaths of Eric Garner, Michael Brown, Trayvon Martin, and Tamir Rice - shaken, but not sufficiently unsettled. We must contextualize those losses, force our neighbors to become so deeply disturbed by what has occurred that they, too, are inspired to act to change the system.","My father, in 1952, just in his 20s, my father became the chief spokesman for the Nation of Islam. From 1952 to 1959, there were four temples. My father was responsible and credited for having maximized this membership. From four temples to 50 temples, there was so much work involved.","My mother witnessed the martyrdom of her husband, Hajj Malik Shabazz, Malcolm X, on Sunday, February 21, 1965, at the Audubon Ballroom in New York City. My older sisters, Attallah, Qubilah and I were seated with our mother up front and stage right.","Betty Shabazz was the wife of a man who challenged a government that was historically unjust. She was harassed and placed under surveillance by the Nation of Islam (NOI), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).","After graduating high school, Betty attended the Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute in Birmingham, Alabama, the alma mater of both her parents. My mother relocated to New York because she refused to accept the oppressive racism of the Jim Crow south.","It is our family's hope that the true legacy and context of Malcolm X's life continues to be shared with people from all walks of life in a positive manner that helps promote the goals and ideals for which Malcolm X so passionately advocated.","We were raised very colour blind. I had gone to school and to camp for so long with white people, I think I was like 15 years old before I realised I was black.","Everyone wants me to be this political person... I'm not Malcolm X.","Of course I was in love with my father as a child. He was Daddy, and our house came alive in a special way whenever he walked through the door. He'd romp and play with us; my sisters and I would literally squeal with excitement when Daddy came home.","I don't know that there is a, quote, 'hip-hop lifestyle.' I think the music responds to complex social issues and injustices; I think it also raises complex social questions."],"Im Dong-Hyun":["When I look down the range at the target all I can do is try to distinguish between the different colors.","Archery is not a sport for everyone. The equipment costs a lot, and it is not easy for everyone to find a place to play. It is perhaps similar to golf, but of course there are more golf courses than archery fields.","I try not to push myself too hard, but I also need to perform and earn the results.","For me, seeing the target and not seeing the target doesn't make any difference.","If I couldn't see the colors, now that would be a problem.","Archery requires very sensitive muscles.","I used to play football at school, and I enjoyed really physical sports, but I now try to avoid any sports that might build up different muscles. That might have a negative impact on my archery.","I had a strong desire to become an archer from the very first time I tried it. I forgot my other ambitions.

Wigs, killer heels, Pilates, even fillers - whatever works for you, honey.","Life is too short not to have pasta, steak, and butter.","There is a lot of noise out there. I don't want to follow the trend - I want to create the trend.","Eliminating the things you love is not wellness. Wellness feeds your soul and makes you feel good.","I was studying political science; I was adamant that I was going to follow in my father's footsteps.","On a Friday night in 1983, I was in a taxi in New York riding home from dinner with friends. A drunk driver ran a red light and hit the cab, and I was thrown toward the glass partition. I tried to duck, but my face hit the glass, and the impact fractured my cheekbone, my eye socket, my collarbone and several ribs.","That is something that my mother instilled in me at a very young age - to know my self-worth. And I have had times again and again in the fashion industry where all of that was tested and I rose to the occasion because I was told that I am worthy and I should be able to walk away from something that is not worthy of me.","At the end of the day, my legacy will not be modelling but my cosmetics line.","People get numbed when they see picture after picture, year in and year out, of people starving.","Change makes you find your calling, your legacy, and God's divine plan for your life. Don't run from it.","The women I gravitate to are the ones who defy convention and reinvent themselves - hence, they reinvent the world around them.","My mother was an activist; so was my father. They came from a generation of young Somalis who were actively involved in getting independence for Somalia in 1960.","It's really not a good idea to forecast or double guess the fates; you will always be fooled.","We all want what every girl wants: to look fabulous while we're out there ruling the world.","Intelligence is sexy. Don't play dumb, especially young girls. Don't play dumb. And let people see that you are intelligent.","Modeling gave me so many experiences, like traveling and being exposed to global cultures, but the most valuable lesson has been working with designers who truly are visionaries in their field.","I'll be truly happy when we're not counting the number of ethnically diverse models on a fashion runway or campaign, when having a representation of the entire human race is the norm and not an exception.","There is no age better than another. The commitment to give of yourself and the knowledge that the time is right are what's important.","I was admittedly comfortable with Iman Cosmetics being identified as a beauty brand that filled the gap for black women because it was deeply personal for me.","I suffer from low self-esteem. I had horrible self-esteem growing up. You really have to save yourself because the critic within you will eat you up. It's not the outside world - it's your interior life, that critic within you, that you have to silence.","There are highlights when you become irreplaceable as a model, like when you become a muse to designers. They look at you differently; you're not a coat hanger for hire.","My looks have changed. I have laugh lines - not wrinkles.","The difference between rearing a child in your 20s and one in your 50s is one of patience.","When everyone is telling you, 'You're so beautiful, there's nobody like you,' you begin to think it's true. But of course there is nobody like you.","We all have friends and loved ones who say 60's the new 30. No. Sixty's the new 60.","At the end of the day, a 34B doesn't give you self-esteem.","I believe the universe has great plans for us. When you are young, you don't learn that.","Nobody has ever said to me that I was pretty, 'til I met Peter Beard.","I am the face of a refugee. I was once a refugee. I was with my family in exile.","I like to get up around 5:30 or six - that's my favorite time of day. My family is still asleep, and the office is still closed, so I can start my day slowly.","I didn't start exercising until the end of my modeling career. When you're young, you eat and drink what you want and stay up all night and still look good.","My ritual is cooking. I find it therapeutic. It comes naturally to me. I can read a recipe and won't have to look at it again.","I would rather Google other people than Google myself.","I vowed to myself when I got married that I would cook every night. I find it very therapeutic.","As I always said: I fell in with David Jones. I did not fall in love with David Bowie.","Bowie is just a persona. He's a singer, an entertainer. David Jones is a man I met.","People called me 'Iman the black model'. In my country, we're all black, so nobody called somebody else black. It was foreign to my ears.","I wasn't a major in political science for nothing, so I understood the politics of beauty and the politics of race when it comes to the fashion industry.","When my daughter Zulekha was born, I was at the pinnacle of my working life as a model, and I pulled myself in two trying to cope with being both a mother and a career girl.","I'm lucky in some ways in that I really don't need more than five or so hours of sleep.","Mrs. Obama is not a great beauty. But she is so interesting-looking - so bright. That will always take you farther.","I was born in Somalia, which is in East Africa. My parents started with nothing: poor, poor, poor. They eloped, which was unheard of in my country, when my father was 17 and my mother was 14.","One afternoon, on my way to the campus - I was majoring in political science at Nairobi University - a photographer by the name of Peter Beard stopped me in the street and asked me if I'd ever been photographed.","I was not considered beautiful at all. Really. And this is what all models say. But I'm still not considered that beautiful in my country. I don't know the beauty ideal where I come from - but it's not me.","I have no intention of ever writing beauty tips on how to make an African-American nose look slimmer or Asian eyes look bigger. That's degrading. Asian eyes are what's beautiful about you and what makes you different.","The day you settle for less is the day you will get less.","We are very private, so we decided from early on that we will keep the press and editors and everybody out of our house.","I have been a muse to Mr. Saint-Laurent, Valentino, Calvin Klein, Donna Karan, Versace.","I am so far more secure and more grounded and more know who I am than when I was in my 20s.","I did not want to get involved with a rock star. No way. It is not a sane thing to do.","My father... gave me a positive connection with men because he is a gentleman.","I have a certain manner of speech that is unique to me. I tried once to have my staff tweet for me, and it was a disaster! People knew right away that it wasn't me.","On my 50th birthday in 2005, my discount-wielding AARP card came in the mail. I hurled it in the trash, put on something fabulous, and had a decadent meal. Just the thought of putting it in my wallet felt like a concession.","Granted, I've changed internally as I've gotten older - I take it easy, I know when to stop and take care of myself, I laugh much more and with my belly and soul - but this comes from the confidence and acceptance that comes with maturity.","I can enjoy what I'm engaged in and be fully present rather than planning my answers to questions while someone else is speaking or thinking about my next appointment while my current engagement is still in in progress.","I'm a very political person, and I think things through clearly, even when I was 18 years old.","I don't look like a white woman. I look Somali.","When I was in high school,we were, like, 4,000 or 5,000 students, and 50 girls - and I didn't have a date for my prom. My father paid my cousin to take me.","I started the cosmetics in 1994 after I stopped modeling, out of my frustration as a woman of color not finding what I needed.","People talk about the miracle of birth. No. There's the miracle of conception. I did IVF, but nothing happened. So I began to think of adoption, and then I got pregnant. It was definitely a miracle.","I was never a practicing Muslim. But I do consider myself a Muslim.","After the bones mended, my left eye was smaller than my right, and my eyebrow never grew back. But you know what? Big deal. I think I became beautiful after the accident. I became kinder, more aware. I gained respect for other people.","Italian was my first foreign language. I speak it better than English.","I beg you, don't use the verb, 'discover', I hate it. What does it mean, that I didn't exist before?","You want a career? Do that first. You don't want to have kids? Then don't. You don't want to get married? Then don't. But once you do something, you've got to know that there is compromise.","We never wore burkas because Somalis had our own culture.","I'm always criticised by other Somalis and Muslims for what I'm doing as a model and married to a white man and all that.","I was under 18, and to leave Kenya to come to the United States, to get a passport, you had to be 18. So I lied and said I was 19 to get the passport, because otherwise, I had to have permission from my parents, and my parents would never have let me come.","We never do Valentine's dinner, because everybody, they look. On Valentine's, imagine me and David going to a restaurant! Like, everybody's going to say, 'Did they talk? Did they hold hands?' Twenty years. We've been married twenty years!","I was a very nerdy child. I never fit in, so I became laboriously studious.","I had never seen 'Vogue.' I didn't read fashion magazines, I read 'Time' and 'Newsweek.'","I would go to cosmetics counters and buy two or three foundations and powders, and then go home and mix them before I came up with something suitable for my undertones.","My given name was Zahra, which is the 'flower of the desert.' I don't look anything like the flower of the desert. My name was changed by my grandfather to Iman, which means 'have faith.' And it meant to have faith that a daughter would come.","I speak five languages besides mine. I went to school in Egypt because girls weren't allowed to go to school in Saudi Arabia. It's very restricting, especially for girls; we're not allowed to go anywhere.","I arrive in New York on October 15, 1975. On my own, by the way.","I'm against a signature look, as that can be very outdating. But having said that, I also know my best qualities, so I'm not going to foolhardily give away my power.","I keep on 5 to 10 pounds above my jeans weight, as the ultimate no-filler-needed refresher, and buy a size up on jeans.","I've always said if what I'm going to create doesn't look good on everybody, I'm not going to do it.","I wanted a bronzer so I could look like I just came from Ibiza everyday.","I have a 15-year-old daughter who thinks that I always had this self confidence that I have now at the age of 60. And I always tell her that what she is going through - the low self-esteem as a teenager - that is a right of passage.","I don't do anything by myself. I have a whole crew to get me ready every day.","I believe in glamour. I am in favor of a little vanity. I don't rely on just my genes.","I thought at 46 years old, I've been removed from the fashion industry for 10 years. I couldn't possibly write a model's book. That's for a 20-year-old. But I could say what I want to say without chastising the industry.","I was raised to treat my body as a temple, but even as a little girl, I had a major issue with self-esteem. I thought there was something wrong with the temple.","There are some people who have helped to advance me and other girls, but the fashion industry is always behind popular culture. They think they understand the zeitgeist. They don't know anything about the zeitgeist.","I don't love eating meat. I really only like chicken and fish.","I tell all my younger friends, 'Don't be afraid of change. That is when you truly see what your destiny is.'","Multicultural markets are nuanced but not alien.","The people who are the most successful in life are not stopped by fear.","When I started modeling, they tried to pay black models less than they paid Caucasian models. I turned down those jobs because I knew what I was worth.","When I lived in Egypt, we always wore kaftans. I had cashmere kaftans from Halston. You put on a kaftan in your backyard, and it's like you're in Ibiza.","The truth was I felt ugly growing up. I only really started feeling comfortable in myself when I was 40.","I can't stand my legs, for a start, and you rarely see me in skirts."],"Imani Hakim":["I owe my success to my two families. If my father hadn't been willing to make sacrifices for me, I would have never won the role on 'Everybody Hates Chris'. I like working with my television family, too. We have a lot of love for each other.","I decided that I wanted to be an actress at the age of 7. This is something I've always known.","I was a big fan of Raven Symone, when 'That's So Raven' was out. I used to say, 'Oh my God, that should be my show!'","When people say, 'If you could do anything else, what would you do?' I would be an actress. That's something that I would do - I can't see myself doing anything else.","I just would like to be challenged. I want to push myself to the limit, and constantly challenge myself and grow as an artist. That's where I want to go. Explore different things, different characters, in film, and just everything!"],"Imelda Marcos":["Win or lose, we go shopping after the election.","Life is not a matter of place, things or comfort; rather, it concerns the basic human rights of family, country, justice and human dignity.","I love everybody. One of the great things about me is that I have a very positive attitude.","People say I'm extravagant because I want to be surrounded by beauty. But tell me, who wants to be surrounded by garbage?","They went into my closets looking for skeletons, but thank God, all they found were shoes, beautiful shoes.","I will come up with a project that will wipe out poverty in the Philippines in two years. I want to remove the people from economic crisis by using the Marcos wealth. Long after I'm gone, people will remember me for building them homes and roads and hospitals and giving them food.","It is shallow people who think beauty is frivolous or excessive. If you are bringing beauty and god, you are enriching the country. Rice feeds the body, books feed the mind, beauty feeds the soul. It is one thing I can really be proud of and stand tall in the world.","I always say you can never be extravagant with beauty. Beauty is God made real. Beauty is life.","If you know how much you've got, you probably haven't got much.","Doesn't the fight for survival also justify swindle and theft? In self defence, anything goes.","The Marcos era was the golden time for the Philippines. We had the lowest crime rate in the world in Manila and real development then. At last, people are starting to understand this.","I have never been a material girl. My father always told me never to love anything that cannot love you back.","I am First Lady by accident. I was not elected by the people but here I am.","Filipinos want beauty. I have to look beautiful so that the poor Filipinos will have a star to look at from their slums.","I really had no great love for shoes. I was a working First Lady; I was always in canvas shoes. I did nurture the shoes industry of the Philippines, and so every time there was a shoe fair, I would receive a pair of shoes as a token of gratitude.","They've listed my name in the dictionary - 'Imeldific' is used to mean ostentatious extravagance... But the truth will prevail.","I did not have three thousand pairs of shoes, I had one thousand and sixty.","The problems with First Ladies is that you have to set the standard. My role is to be both star and slave.","Continuous persecution of widows and orphans is a crime. Even the Bible says there is a specific place in hell for those who oppress widows.","My dreams were always small and puny. All I ever needed was a little house with a little picket fence by the sea. Little did I know that I would live in Malacanang Palace for 20 years and visit all the major palaces of mankind. And then also meet ordinary citizens and the leaders of superpowers.","I get so tired listening to one million dollars here, one million dollars there, it's so petty.","God is love. I have loved. Therefore, I will go to heaven.","I hate ugliness. You know I'm allergic to ugliness.","I have a different way of thinking. I think synergistically. I'm not linear in thinking, I'm not very logical.","If you know how rich you are, you are not rich. But me, I am not aware of the extent of my wealth. That's how rich we are.","It's the rich you can terrorize. The poor have nothing to lose.","My husband does not like me to give interviews because I say too much. No talk, no trouble.","Never dress down for the poor. They won't respect you for it. They want their First Lady to look like a million dollars.","They call me corrupt, frivolous. I am not at all privileged. Maybe the only privileged thing is my face. And corrupt? God! I would not look like this if I am corrupt. Some ugliness would settle down on my system.","We practically own everything in the Philippines.","When they see me holding fish, they can see that I am comfortable with kings as well as with paupers.","My dreams have become puny with the reality my life has become.","I was no Marie Antoinette. I was not born to nobility, but I had a human right to nobility.","Filipinos don't wallow in what is miserable and ugly. They recycle the bad into things of beauty.","I hardly can sleep. I feel that my target now is really to save Mother Earth for humanity. And it's doable.","The Reagans were dear friends for many years, even when he was governor of California. Nancy appreciated a lot of Philippine-made things.","Ferdinand was a gold trader. He was a lawyer for mining companies. When he entered politics in l949, he had tons and tons of gold. When Bill Gates was a college dropout, Ferdinand already possessed billions of dollars and tons of gold. It wasn't stolen.","I beg Osama to stop warring. He is a Muslim, and Islam means peace. Nobody wins in a war... I wish I were tapped in the problem about Iraq. I knew Saddam enough that I could have talked him into surrendering. But it's too late.","The only rich person is a person who is rich in spirit. I have no money deposit. I have only beauty deposit.","The problem of the world today is the people talk on and on about democracy, freedom, justice. But I don't give a damn about democracy if I am worried about survival.","The Philippines is a terrible name, coming from Spain. Phillip II was the father of the inquisition, who I believe died of syphilis. It is my great regret that we didn't change the name of our country.","You know, not even your British Queen is called just Elizabeth - she's Elizabeth the Second. There's only one Imelda."],"Imelda May":["People expect you to change when you become a mother, and of course my priorities changed when I had Violet. She's number one in my life and the best thing that ever happened to me, but I still have fun. I am still myself, but that is made out to seem like I am rebelling against motherhood.","I love to have no plans. It is amazing where your day can turn when you have no plans: meeting people or just going to a little pub on the side of the road.","I'm not saying that women shouldn't pursue careers, but if it is going to be equal in the workplace, it should certainly pan out to be a little bit more equal in the home, too.","Up-tempo or slow tempo, I don't feel that one is better than the other.","Ooooh, I love Nashville! It seems like everywhere you walk, there's great music coming out of every wall.","For me, rockabilly is very, very exciting music. It's electric and kind of wild, you know? It's 'make your hairs stand up on the back of your neck' kind of music.","I never miss a vote; I think that's the power of the people. A lot of people fought and died for us to have votes, for women to have votes in particular - your vote is your one weapon.","Ireland and America, music-wise, are very closely related. The Irish came over with their fiddles in hand, and you can hear it in the bluegrass and rockabilly. I love it when music from different countries combine.","I started singing in church with my sister Maria when I was four, and I've been pretty much singing ever since. There's never been anything else for me to do.","I've used a stylist twice, and that was when I didn't have time to go shopping or pick up an outfit for a photo shoot. I think you should dress yourself, have fun with it - it's only clothes.","Don't lie - when you are 105 years of age - on your deathbed, thinking, 'I should have done a few things!' I would like to think I tried as much as I could.","I was brought up with beautiful music - Nat King Cole and Glen Miller from my dad, and my mum loved Judy Garland and Doris Day - brilliant stuff. Through my brothers and sisters I heard David Bowie and The Specials, The Carpenters, Meatloaf and The Rolling Stones.","'Love Tattoo' I recorded without a record company. I'd gotten turned down by the record companies - they said they didn't get me, which is fine, I suppose.","I don't do grey. I like my colour, my style.","If you ask me, rockabilly has had a raw deal for far too long. People never shunned the blues or jazz the way they do rockabilly. But it's the original punk-rock, and it changed the way people looked at music for ever.","At school, I'd refuse to take part in biology lessons when animals were being dissected. One time, the teacher announced that we would be gassing worms. So I ran around the room, gathered up all the worms and set them free in the fields. I just loved animals and couldn't bear the thought of them suffering.","When I'm writing, I mean what I'm saying - there's a lot of me in each song.","I remember once doing a gig in Ireland, and there was a woman jumping around and screaming, 'I don't know what this is but I love it!' I thought that was a nice compliment.","I don't think the music that I do is nostalgic in any way; I don't think about going back to nice, old-fashioned music. I'm certainly influenced by old music, but I want to bring it slap-bang up to today.","I am not musically educated yet. I don't read - I make my own language that works for myself. But I play by ear.","I was one of those annoying kids that loves singing and entertaining.","I believe in God.","When I tell people that I lost my baby weight through breastfeeding, they think I'm exaggerating. But it was brilliant for that. It is great for bonding with your baby. It is hard when no one else can feed her, but it was worth it for me. I loved it.","I think I'd like to be one of those eccentric 80-year-old women.","I never co-write. I've tried it before, and I just can't do it.","I like to escape; I like to write when I go on a walk - I'm kind of very fairy that way. I get inspired by the wind. Or when I daydream, that's when I write.","I enjoy music so much; it's such a passion in my life, and I hope that comes across.","My parents never told me to get a real job. They always said, 'Go for it! If this is what you want to do, work hard.' They were always very supportive.","I don't see why women have to get naked to sell an album. It's crazy.","I love the shape of '50s fashion: the clothes are very flattering; they let you out in the right places. I love high heels, too, as I'm only five foot three, although I always tell people I'm five foot five.","You have to change your life for yourself, and it's about the fun of getting there - sitting in the tour van, breaking down on the side of the road, you know, having a laugh with the guys in the band, making mistakes with nobody watching.","I was brought up with old-fashioned values. I wasn't allowed to have a boyfriend until I finished school. I wasn't allowed to wear make-up: the nuns would scrub your face if they saw it.","I got my first leopard print coat when I was 15. I nearly got beat up, but I was happy with it.","When I was a teenager, I had a record company after me. They wanted me to be a pop act. They said they wanted me to be the next Sonia. I was 16 at the time. I said, 'No thank you.'","I couldn't think of anything worse than hating your own music and having to play it every night. It would be a nightmare.","I don't tend to set out on huge world domination goals or have anything in mind. I just like to play. I like to gig a lot; I like to write music.","I started gigging when I was about 16, and I was way too young to be in the clubs.","Music rules a lot of my life - I was bitten by the bug young.","I went to a Catholic all-girls school, and we would play cassettes of music we liked, and when it was my turn, they would laugh at my choices. I would play Billie Holliday, Elmore James and Howlin' Wolf, but it was fine; if I had to listen to their choices, they had to listen to mine.","I love punk rock, The Clash, The Ramones, The Cramps. I love where it all came from, and music for my ears now, it has to have that same electricity, adrenaline and danger.","I'm not filthy rich! I'm not as rich as people think. It's funny, isn't it?","I'm on the road earning my money. I didn't get any million pound record deals. Not unless you're Jedward! I'm doing very well, but I still have a mortgage to pay off. So I'm on the road.","Music was always part of my life - my mother says I came out singing. I wanted to be Gene Kelly - or Judy Garland.","I'm a normal consumer but try to do the best I can. I try to buy locally, and I mostly avoid supermarkets.","I'm a big believer in 'pick yourself up, dust yourself off, and start again.'","I got a great kick being in the Warner Bros. studios - that was really cool. I kept singing the 'Looney Tunes' theme song all day. I'm sure they haven't heard that one before.","In my head, I consider 'No Turning Back' my 'dipping the toe in the water' album. It was mostly covers of favorite songs, and there were three originals in there. So, it feels like it was just my album to see what the temperature of the water was.","In a way, I'm lucky that I was never classically trained and never went to a music college. I'm just from a normal working class family and happened to get obsessed with music as a teenager.","One thing that did get me into a lot of different types of music was when I was very young, the local record store went out of business and they were selling off all the vinyl. I remember going in - I was probably 16 or 17 and I'd just gotten a record player as a present. It was like hitting the jackpot: all these records for $3 apiece.","I'm lucky to come from a very musical family. If you put a record on and turn the volume up, there's a pretty good chance you'll have a lot of people dancing very quickly.","I love festivals in that people seem to let their hair down more. I love that people run from stage to stage. I love going as a performer because you get to see band that you wouldn't necessarily go see.","I worry about people who sell out to chase fame because when they get it, it might not be so satisfying.","I can talk a lot and not reveal anything; I would make a great politician.","I love people with strong convictions, because we are living in a very PC world. You can't crack a joke without it being in the headlines.","I'm the youngest of five - three girls and two boys. There was one record player for the seven of us. It was good for me, because I got to hear everyone else's music.","When I heard Elvis and his 'Sun Sessions,' I went mad for it. I was about thirteen.","I lost a boyfriend over Elmore James. You know that moment when you send mixtapes at fifteen? He sent me pop hits, and I sent him Elmore James, and I never heard from him again.","I never got formal training in music. I would just sit with my ear to the speaker and my hand on the needle. I'd listen to Wanda Jackson and think, 'How did she do that?,' and lift the needle and try it myself.","There have never been so many women in the music industry, but they're doing ballads and pop. Where's the new Joan Jetts and the Wanda Jacksons and the Debbie Harrys, all these strong women? I wanna be the woman that rocks.","I couldn't live on the singing at first, so I worked as a cleaner, in a launderette, in a garage, face painting and doing the windows of shops at Christmas, 'cause I had been to art college.","I'm sorry, but Juicy Couture tracksuits and Ugg boots don't move me in any way, shape or form. I refuse to wear them. Modern fashion doesn't appeal to me; the 1950s were better in every way, don't you think?","Everybody told me that if I insisted on doing rockabilly music, I'd never have a chance of selling any records. In fact, I lost count of how many people told me to ditch it all together, in favour, I guess, of sounding like everybody else.","In 2008, I was in a London park when I came across a fledgling crow that had fallen from the top of an oak tree. A woman happened to be passing, and she said that she rescued animals, so she invited me back to her house. It turned out she was the wife of Jeff Beck. Jeff was there, and we ended up jamming together.","I'd watch old movies with Judy Garland, Shirley Temple and Bette Davis and long to be part of that glamorous world. A lot of that glamour is gone now. In my own small way, I hope I'm bringing some of it back. But it would be great if I could inspire women to dress up.","I'm in no hurry to get old. But when I do, I'll be out to enjoy every last minute. I see myself at 90 in some nursing home, waving my walking stick about as I jive to Gene Vincent records.","I would love to work with Leonard Cohen, Tom Waits, B.B. King. I'd love to do something with Arctic Monkeys, Miles Kane, and The Last Shadow Puppets. If I got a call from Juliette Lewis or PJ Harvey, or Chrissie Hynde, that'd be a thrill.","I had a big time punk-rock phase and psychobilly phase. I used to go mad for the Guana Batz.","I tried to be a goth for a while. I'd pour baby powder on my face and paint my lips black, but that didn't last long. I thought I looked cool at the time. But then you look back and wonder, 'Why did anyone let me out of the house looking like that?'","I'm not comparing myself at all to him, but I like the idea that Ernest Hemingway always wrote about certain things he knew, he knew the ins and outs, back to fronts of what he was talking about. I love that as an inspiration for myself, to keep it true to what you know.","American audiences are great. They get what I am doing, but as my band will tell you, nowhere tops the Irish audience. They are just brilliant. They are very open, but the Americans and Spanish come a close second.","The Spanish and the American audiences are lunatics. They are very passionate and, like the Irish, they don't have as many inhibitions. If you are playing somewhere like Austria or Sweden, it takes them a little while to come out of themselves.","I have no big career plan. It is better for me that way.","I always loved the bad girls in the movies. I loved Bette Davis; I loved Katherine Hepburn. I loved Ava Gardner.","I'm not a feminist that hates men by any means.","I know exactly what it's like to not have a penny. I know exactly what it's like trying to get a job. I know exactly what it's like having bloody one tin of Ambrosia left in the cupboard. But I know I can survive.","I love to cook. I love having friends over and family. I am definitely a feeder - I feed everybody. I am jumping around the kitchen like a crazy woman.","I was from a tough neighborhood, and we didn't have a lot of money, but my dad worked hard, and my mom is good at budgeting things. That made me appreciate things.","I love to look back, but I don't want my music to be nostalgic. I want it to have the same vibrancy that the music I love had when it came out. I'm trying to get that electricity.","With great artists like Elvis, sometimes the songs weren't the greatest thing about him. When I tried to perform some of the songs, I noticed some of the tunes weren't all that brilliant, but it was the performance that sold them.","I even sang once at the opening of a supermarket. You name it, I've done it.","I wash my face and put moisturiser on; I've never had a facial, and I don't get my hair or my nails done. I just do it all myself.","Thrashing about on stage is my exercise for the day!"],"Imelda Staunton":["Children should always be brave and do something about bullying. It's not okay to stand by and let it happen. Bullies thrive off secrecy. Children should tell someone if they see someone being bullied.","Chaotic people often have chaotic lives, and I think they create that. But if you try and have an inner peace and a positive attitude, I think you attract that.","Looking back, there is nothing wrong with that peace, love and equality that the hippies espoused. In many ways, we have regressed because they were into organic food, back to nature, make love not war, be good to all men, share and share alike - which is what many are talking about now.","You can only do your best. That's all you can do. And if it isn't good enough, it isn't good enough.","At the time of Woodstock, I was just 13, but I used to see these exotic hippy creatures and I did look on with envy. How could you not? In an ideal world, I would have loved to have been a hippy - but I might have been a bit strait-laced. It was my fantasy.","You read about poor people having Botox go wrong and you think: 'Well, what the bloody hell were you doing?' Why would you inject yourself with poison? And why are we spending so much time looking at ourselves? I just don't get it.","A lot of film stars are just playing themselves in different frocks.","Both my parents had heart problems: my mother had type 2 diabetes, and my father had a stroke.","We all must support the arts, as it is our culture. It makes us better people. It makes us happy; it gives us empathy and shows us how to live. It is so important.","I've always liked new writing.","I worked in rep for six years, then I came to London and to the National Theatre. What's better than that?","If you're at an award ceremony, you're against your mates.","Agents and producers have to get you into a box to accommodate their limited imaginations.","Look at Judi Dench, who's brilliant in whatever bloody job she does.","I adore Bette Davis and Vivien Leigh, but more because they were good actresses. That's what makes me interested in them, that they didn't present themselves as idols; they were just doing their jobs.","Fortunately my career has never been about how I look, it's about how I can be.","Her death has had a huge effect on me. It felt like a big hole appeared on my left side - apparently your left side is your mother - which I thought could never be filled. Now I think what you have to do is fill it with yourself because your mother is part of you. I'm easing into that space, using it and being comforted by it.","I don't feel the need for religion. But I went on a yoga retreat last year and I do believe slightly in the karma thing and just being good and true unto yourself. And I slightly believe that you can attract good and bad to you.","Having a child makes you strong and gives you chutzpah. It relaxed my attitude to the job; my center of focus shifted, which I think is very helpful, because even if you're not a very indulgent actor you spend a lot of time thinking about yourself. I don't think that is particularly healthy.","A lot of me is very up, and you have to have light and shade. They are both important and you have to be able to balance them. You have to admit that sadness is part of you and that it enriches you. I use it in my work.","You could say I'm a character actress. Or maybe a character actress who does peculiar, interesting lead roles. Does that make sense?","The one good thing is that I get a lot more good scripts coming through my letterbox. 'Vera Drake' raised my profile in one way, and then 'Harry Potter' in another.","To me, it's really not about how I look - it's about who I can be. It is my job to bring the character to life and my duty to fit into the jigsaw in that story.","You could say I'm a character actress. Or maybe a character actress who does peculiar, interesting lead roles.","I was brought up a Catholic, so I take no pleasure in guilt.","I think the first 10 years of my daughter's life were my mother's happiest, because she could finally have carefree time with a kid.","I never wanted for anything. We went to Ireland for holidays every year. I was 14 when we first went to Italy. My mum was determined I was going to go to a good school. My mum was an absolute grafter. A real grafter. I got my work ethic from her.","I've always tried to fight against, 'Oh, who's that small funny actress? Let's get her.'","Drama school introduced me to a world I had no idea about. I wasn't brought up in a literary household at all.","We're in a world that celebrates things: success, beauty, money. And I reckon that's really about 4 per cent of the world. The rest of us are just getting on with it.","I don't think it's that I don't like Sondheim. It's that I find it really... I don't know how to describe it. Doing it is the most extraordinary thing. Because it's like Shakespeare times 100 with singing. It's that satisfying - and that demanding.","For everyday clothes, I love North Face and Rohan, and for smarter options, I like Whistles and Agnes b on Marylebone High Street.","I've fallen over on stage a couple of times, but I've only ever bruised my ego.","I start the day with either Radio 3 or Radio 4. I don't watch any daytime television at all.","There are lots of wonderful actors doing animated films these days, but I prefer it when you can't recognise them - it means they've really become the character.","We're all unique as actors. To yourself, you are unique. You have to think, 'I'm me. I'm not going to bunch myself with other people.' Agents and producers have to get you into a box to accommodate their limited imaginations.","I am a character actress. Well, let's say, I am a leading character actress who does interesting, odd parts.","You can be very famous without being a great actress, and that's not good for me."],"Immaculee Ilibagiza":["Rwanda can be a paradise again, but it will take the love of the entire world to heal my homeland. And that's as it should be, for what happened in Rwanda happened to us all - humanity was wounded by the genocide.","When you start to see another human being as less than you, it's a danger.","To me, I think justice is part of forgiving, if it is well done with love.","I love the American dream. I feel this is the place I was supposed to be in. It's beautiful. I love it.","I believe that we can heal Rwanda - and our world - by healing one heart at a time.","The power of forgiveness is huge; it is really big, and it can save this world.","Forgiving the men who killed my parents and brother was a process, a journey into deeper and deeper prayer."],"Immanuel Kant":["Science is organized knowledge. Wisdom is organized life.","Two things awe me most, the starry sky above me and the moral law within me.","In law a man is guilty when he violates the rights of others. In ethics he is guilty if he only thinks of doing so.","Thoughts without content are empty, intuitions without concepts are blind.","Live your life as though your every act were to become a universal law.","Morality is not the doctrine of how we may make ourselves happy, but how we may make ourselves worthy of happiness.","It is beyond a doubt that all our knowledge begins with experience.","To be is to do.","If man makes himself a worm he must not complain when he is trodden on.","I had therefore to remove knowledge, in order to make room for belief.","Experience without theory is blind, but theory without experience is mere intellectual play.","All our knowledge begins with the senses, proceeds then to the understanding, and ends with reason. There is nothing higher than reason.","Always recognize that human individuals are ends, and do not use them as means to your end.","May you live your life as if the maxim of your actions were to become universal law.","Ingratitude is the essence of vileness.","It is not God's will merely that we should be happy, but that we should make ourselves happy.","All the interests of my reason, speculative as well as practical, combine in the three following questions: 1. What can I know? 2. What ought I to do? 3. What may I hope?","Act that your principle of action might safely be made a law for the whole world.","He who is cruel to animals becomes hard also in his dealings with men. We can judge the heart of a man by his treatment of animals.","From such crooked wood as that which man is made of, nothing straight can be fashioned.","Metaphysics is a dark ocean without shores or lighthouse, strewn with many a philosophic wreck.","Religion is the recognition of all our duties as divine commands.","It is not necessary that whilst I live I live happily; but it is necessary that so long as I live I should live honourably.","The only objects of practical reason are therefore those of good and evil. For by the former is meant an object necessarily desired according to a principle of reason; by the latter one necessarily shunned, also according to a principle of reason.","By a lie, a man... annihilates his dignity as a man.","Immaturity is the incapacity to use one's intelligence without the guidance of another.","Happiness is not an ideal of reason, but of imagination.","What can I know? What ought I to do? What can I hope?","Even philosophers will praise war as ennobling mankind, forgetting the Greek who said: 'War is bad in that it begets more evil than it kills.'","So act that your principle of action might safely be made a law for the whole world.","Seek not the favor of the multitude; it is seldom got by honest and lawful means. But seek the testimony of few; and number not voices, but weigh them.","Out of timber so crooked as that from which man is made nothing entirely straight can be carved.","But although all our knowledge begins with experience, it does not follow that it arises from experience.","A categorical imperative would be one which represented an action as objectively necessary in itself, without reference to any other purpose.","All thought must, directly or indirectly, by way of certain characters, relate ultimately to intuitions, and therefore, with us, to sensibility, because in no other way can an object be given to us.","Intuition and concepts constitute... the elements of all our knowledge, so that neither concepts without an intuition in some way corresponding to them, nor intuition without concepts, can yield knowledge.","Nothing is divine but what is agreeable to reason."],"Immanuel Velikovsky":["When I was a child of six or seven my father would show me the chapter in the prophet Isaiah where the name Immanuel is found; more than once he spoke to me of the faith he put in me.","On the day I was born, or possibly on one of the following days, my father went on a walk in the forested hills and thought of a name for me. His first son was called Daniel, and Samuel in memory of one of his forefathers.","My first name - I have no middle name - was chosen by my father, as he told me, on that solitary walk in the forested hills. He selected it from a verse of the seventh chapter of Isaiah; there was no Immanuel among our ancestors known to him.","My father felt that his world of ideas was too liberal for traditional rabbinical teachings, and he looked for a chance to find a way in life.","My earliest memory is dreamlike: in a small orchard or garden I am carried on the arm, I believe, of my father; there was a group of grown-ups, my mother among them, and the group was slowly walking in the orchard, it seems toward the house.","It is difficult to describe in short the enthusiasm and devotion provoked by and given to my research. We lived almost in poverty. I used pencils, two for a nickel, and could not buy a fountain pen, when I lost mine."],"Imogen Cunningham":["When you do portraits professionally it's not a desire, it's for money.","I was invited to photograph Hollywood. They asked me what I would like to photograph. I said, Ugly men.","I turn people into human beings by not making them into gods.","I was brought up on art. My father thought I had a great hand at art and sent me to art school. But he did not want me to become a photographer.","I don't resent anything.","I think San Francisco is the best place in the whole world for an easy life.","Anybody is influenced by where and how he lives.","Well, I turn people into human beings by not making them into gods.","I never stopped photographing. There were a couple of years when I didn't have a darkroom, but that didn't stop me from photographing.","I was poor. When you're poor you work, and when you're rich you expect somebody to hand it to you. So I think being reasonably poor is very good for people.","When People magazine called me, I did the job on Ansel. I'm older than Ansel and he has to mind me.","I don't love the world. I think Jupiter should have hit us.","Everybody who does anything for the public can be criticized. There's always someone who doesn't like it.","I don't know what love means.","Some people say to me, Isn't it too bad that people discovered you so late? I never thought that.","I don't talk about success. I don't know what it is. Wait until I'm dead.","I became kind of a drop-out in science after I came back to America. I wanted to photograph.","Get it out of your historic head.","It's silly to keep people alive who have a terrible disease.","I don't think there's any such thing as teaching people photography, other than influencing them a little. People have to be their own learners. They have to have a certain talent.","I'd never kill myself for a man. I wouldn't do it for anybody.","My mind is vacant on names, but I know him as well as anything. When I need names they drop out of my head; when I don't need them they drop back.","I told the students that whatever they did in class was for the wastebasket.","I hate big models.","When people ask me silly questions about my private life, I just say, I don't discuss that.","Oh, you ask me, what is the greatest torture of a person who does portraits for a living? I could fill several volumes with nice nasty stories. I don't know.","A woman said to me when she first sat down, You're photographing the wrong side of my face. I said, Oh, is there one?","You see, I became kind of a drop-out in science after I came back to America.","When I need names they drop out of my head; when I don't need them they drop back.","There are certain things you don't discuss with Ansel, especially if you don't agree."],"Imogen Heap":["It's been so amazing. I've always struggled with this barrier that I felt like I'd had up until blogging came along. Just one comment from somebody really sparks something in me. It doesn't need to be this huge war between me and the listeners anymore. I really thrive on that.","Some people think electronic music is cold, but I think that has more to do with the people listening than the actual music itself.","My songs have a lot going on in them -they're packed with sounds. When I have only three or four minutes to capture something, I guess I can't stand the idea of any bar going unloved.","I never had any social life, just played the piano and studied, studied, studied.","I'm interested in creating a little sound world for songs, really crafting it, building it, and making it like a little doll's house with little things inside it, staircases and rooms and everything kind of relates to everything else. I've never seen it as drums, bass, guitar and vocals in very separate spaces.","Even though the popularity and the fanbase is much much greater, and more people have heard about me through things like the Grammys and the Ivors and touring and word of mouth, it doesn't reflect in the sales of the record and doesn't go into my pocket.","So many venues are owned by these various different ticketing and promoting people, and they're all in bed with one another. It's no secret over here.","My biggest asset is not cash - it's a large, growing, devout fanbase.","It may come as a surprise, but Frou Frou was really like a kind of little holiday from my own work. Guy and I, we have always worked together, and then over the years, it became clear that we wanted to do a whole album together. It was very organic and spontaneous - just one of those wonderful things that happens.","Most of the time, the lyrics are kind of like my secret messages to my friends or my boyfriend or my mom or my dad. I would never tell them that these songs are about them or which specific lyric is about somebody. Often, when I sit down to write a lyric, it is in the heat of the moment, and something has just happened.","I just love crafting and shaping sounds. Actually, many of the sounds that I work with start off as organic instruments - guitar, piano, clarinet, etc. But I do love the rigidity of electronic drums.","There was this song I was working on called 'Swing.' It was almost finished, but there was something missing, and I couldn't for the life of me figure it out. And then this little piece of information - this little tweet - came to the forefront of my mind.","Living in the U.K., there is no way to know whether anyone in India likes my music, but I was surprised to see people singing along while I performed in Pune.","I'm never gonna go into a studio and work for a whole year non-stop. Just every day on my own in the studio working, it's just too damn hard.","Once I actually get in the studio and I start working, I'm fine, but it's just getting there and these hours of torment with myself and self doubt, thinking 'I'm useless' and 'Who am I, conning myself into thinking I can do it again.'","I get so fed up with the making of an album taking over my life - it's all I can think about or talk about. You find yourself in a rut and lacking inspiration and it's hard to get out of that because I'm working alone in the studio.","My grand plan is that I can master having a better life by making sure I have a regular flow of songs. Then I can give myself time to tour or celebrate or write a film score.","On YouTube you can tell what countries are watching and I've definitely noted a strong Australian following. You can plan your tours around where the love is on Twitter and YouTube - before, you couldn't tell.","Leaving the record companies tweaked something inside me and I realised I don't have to deal with labels to make something happen. If I want to meet someone, I don't have to go through the label - I'll just go to them. I took my life in my hands and social media has just helped me do that more.","I'll meet someone on the street and blurt out my most intimate details. I think everybody secretly - or not so secretly - wants to be understood, and I just want to connect, you know?","Twitter helps me connect to the people who help make my music, or the cycle of an album, complete. Without them experiencing the music, it doesn't really exist, so it doesn't make sense to not involve them.","I feel like I've grown up a bit. I'm a bit more confident, and I've been reading more, and I've had a little more time to myself. I went on this writing trip to gather my thoughts about where and who I am in this world, and why we're all here.","There's this idea of a star, and this person is very aloof and writes all the music, and they don't talk to anyone unless they go through the record label. And I always felt very uncomfortable about that.","I'm very lazy when it comes to making the original sound. I don't go through amplifiers and different compressors and signal parts. I just grab something, whether its an old guitar or a children's toy that happens to be lying around, and record it straight into the computer.","When I was 12, I went to boarding school, where I discovered the computer, which meant I no longer had to write something down and get someone to play it, I could just type it into the computer and hear it back.","If the night's right and the people are right, of course I want to be out, I want to be socializing. I don't want to be in my studio 24 hours a day for the whole rest of my life.","I think the biggest part of a good party is the host and then going around making sure nobody's left alone and knows enough about the people in the room to know who to introduce to whom.","I do really silly dancing. I love dancing, but I'm not cool when I dance. It's not about my moves, it's not about how cool I am, it's not about how slick I look on the dance floor, it's about having a great time."],"Imogen Poots":["You collect people to take with you. Some people change, other people don't... it's wonderful because I've met some incredible friends.","Seriously, I don't think there's any right way to do anything apart from if you're just being you; then it's a sincere situation.","I'm lucky in that I have close friends and family and my agent to advise me.","I can scare myself like a pro.","I don't think anything's ever simple. Everyone's just trying to understand each other, and whether that's because you're in a relationship or because you're meeting their friends or because their meeting your brother or whatever it is, nothing like that is ever smooth running.","I do think 'All Is by My Side' is the type of film I'm the most happiest.","I love America a lot. I really do.","San Francisco, coolest place ever.","If I'm really honest, I'm not a huge fan of scary films.","I'm not a huge fan of scary movies, but I love doing them because your character arc gets condensed, and everything is elevated, and so you kind of have this amazing opportunity to go in many different places.","I do admit to being slightly in love with Christopher Walken.","I find the aristocratic parts of London so unattractive and angular; the architecture is so white and gated. But in New York, it's different - even uptown it's really grand, and there's no real segregation there. It's all mixed up.","You can tell when someone is putting on a role. If someone really believes in what they're saying, it's quite hard to find cracks.","With 'That Awkward Moment', you could argue I'm just playing the girlfriend of Zac Efron, but the director was such a creative force and let me make her my own. I loved being part of something that felt so relevant and fresh.","I love my real mom and dad; I love them both equally.","It's kind of funny, with all of the different outlets that come from acting that you could try, I would love to direct and kind of be involved in art direction, too.","I really love the '90s. I love the music from then for sure, and to go back to New York then would be a really wonderful thing.","If a role has been too one-dimensional, I have turned it down.","You have to think about what you want to do. There is nothing to say that you should study from the age of 20 to 23. I learnt more on a film set at 17 than in the classroom.","I love art, but not in a cliched, luvvie way.","I never personalize anything because I think that can be dangerous. For me, the best way is - this may sound pretentious - but it's to breathe the character and get into the psychology of it.","I still try to be a feminist in some tiny way.","It is a difficult one, as you get scripts where women are just objects.","There's a lot of interviews now where nobody seems to talk about anything. Like it's illegal. But it can be fun if you stay involved. Like most conversations.","'Fright Night' I can just about deal with. Because the original is such a 1980s extravaganza. Which is a good thing. Obviously. But something like 'The Others' or anything psychological: I'm no good with that. I don't like it when there's space for me to use my imagination.","My dad moved to London in his early 20s and didn't really go back. So the irony is I've spent lots and lots of time in Ireland, but not with my dad. I've shot films in Belfast, where he's from. And I've shot in Dun Laoghaire. Which is great. And I've shot in Dublin.","The business is so international now; you'll be working on an American film, and you'll start chatting to someone, and it's like: 'Oh, you're English, too.'","I'm a big Johnny Cash girl. And I love singers like Laura Marling and Joanna Newsom.","I was about 14 when I started with a theater group; it was like a stage group on the weekends alongside school. And it was run by a group of guys who'd been to drama school themselves in London. So they introduced us to techniques that they'd learn about, and they kind of informed us about improvisation and screenwriting and all of that stuff.","There is more for women in terms of character roles now. Judi Dench and Maggie Smith have constantly changed over the years and challenged themselves with different roles. That's impressive.","Unfortunately, Poots is the name that I've been graced with for my life, but it's not short for anything - apart from Imogen Poots.","I don't think I've ever met any single person who has been vulgar. But you know, you learn along the way that some people are going to be very generous, and other people... It's just not innate within them. Sometimes I think you just have to decide if you're going to stand up and get on with it or if you're going to be crushed and threatened.","I'd say a good couple of my closest male friends are directors.","You've got these big studio films and these tiny independent films now. It's very much either/or. With the independent films, it's always a beautiful risk - it might never be seen. With the studio films, you're conforming to the formula of what's always been in place.","I do think 'All Is by My Side' is the type of film I'm the most happiest. You know, I'm figuring it out. I did just move to New York, so I have to pay my rent.","I generally try and have great days, because I feel very lucky to be doing what I'm doing.","I was very aware of Jeff Buckley. My brother actually bought me The Mamas And The Papas and Jeff Buckley for my birthday when I was in my early teens."],"Imogene Coca":["The trouble with most comedians who try to do satire is that they are essentially brash, noisy and indelicate people who have to use a sledge hammer to smash a butterfly.","I never thought of myself in comedy at all... I loved going to the theatre and seeing people wearing beautiful clothes come down the staircase and start to dance."],"Imran Amed":["I love nothing better than immersing myself in different street cultures; exploring all those neighbourhoods in Tokyo was quite amazing, or visiting Morocco to see an Inditex factory.","Although he's no longer with us, Steve Jobs is still inspirational to me, as he managed to find the balance between right brain/left-brain thinking that is crucial to building a creative technology business.","Know your target audience. Always keep them at the forefront of your mind. Understand their lifestyle and what they are looking for. Gather their feedback and use it to tailor your approach. The voice of the consumer is an essential input into the development of any fashion business or blog.","Even back in elementary school, I was a leader, but a leader who didn't know how to channel my leadership skills in a constructive way. When I was younger, it probably came out as being more of a bossy little kid.","Fashion is always seen as somewhat frivolous and self-indulgent. And I think people on the inside maybe don't see or understand how exciting and diverse a business it is.","Fashion is not art. Fashion is a business that requires discipline and attention to detail and very organized systems of logistics and operations and processes. But even with the most smoothly oiled machine to manage the business, without creativity, fashion could not exist.","One cabbie chastened me by saying that the fashion industry was doing harm to young people, who are trying to live up to an unrealistic ideal. It prompted me to make body image and diversity key issues on 'The Business of Fashion.'","Frankly, I don't understand the monthly magazines that continue to publish news that is two months old and which has already been reported on ad nauseam online, including on their own websites.","Digital has really made the fashion industry a lot more transparent. So people can see and understand how the industry really works, and participate in an industry that was very inaccessible to people. The only thing that people used to see before was the end product. Anyone can participate in it now.","When you come through a business education, a lot of what they teach you is to make decisions through analysis, and logic and rationale, and I'm a big believer in that. But I also believe in the power of instinct. The truth is you're never going to have a perfect answer or view of how it is going to work.","Fashion is an industry of action, not discussion.","It's not like I ever sat in my room and said I was going to start a media company and become an editor in chief. It was never my dream. It was something that just happened.","Most of my ideas come from drawing patterns across conversations I have with different types of people - technology investors, young fashion design students, a CEO. This variety is stimulating and offers many different perspectives on the things I am thinking about.","Growing up in Canada, I used to love a walk in the early morning, when the streets are quiet and the sun was shining. Walking in the morning is still very refreshing... and if I can, I will walk to my first meeting or appointment.","Education was something my parents always put a lot of emphasis on. It was naturally in me, and my sister is equally driven. She is a paediatric endocrinologist.","In the daytime, I was studying at school and in the evenings, I was a stage kid. I was trained in theatre and public speaking. I was a really active kid.","A whole series of events pushed me towards meditation, and now it's become such an integral part of the way I manage myself. It's a tool for me; when you're an entrepreneur, and you're pulled in every direction, it is wonderful to have this discipline.","The most fascinating part is how fashion just attracts all these social rejects, if you will, from around the world, encourages individuality. They're the people who make the industry tick.","For someone who comes from my business background, getting fashion people aligned around certain things can be a challenge. In a way, the industry is so forward-looking. And yet, sometimes people in fashion are not open to change.","One of my closest friends was a half-black, half-Jewish girl. Another good friend had a shaved head... but I was also friends with jocks. I was a 'floater,' I guess you could say.","I'm regularly speaking at London Business School and Harvard Business School. They're the next generation of leaders in the fashion industry.","I realised I had to work in something creative, but with a business and global element. And that I had to do it while I was still young and had an appetite for risk.","I usually have eight to 10 meetings a day and travel 150 days a year..._It sounds crazy, but I wouldn't have it any other way.","My parents landed in Calgary in December 1974, straight from Nairobi. They were immigrants, like many people coming to build a better life. My mom was five months pregnant with me when they landed.","I always wanted to do creative things, but I was really interested in entrepreneurship. My family comes from a very entrepreneurial culture, so business was always something I was interested in.","I could have probably built a great career in management consulting, but one of the insights that I had early on is that just because you're good at something doesn't mean that you should continue to do it. Somewhere in my heart of hearts I knew it wasn't what I wanted to do.","As I began to take risks, leaving my very comfortable and secure job and taking this first leap into fashion, every subsequent risk became easier to take because I began to see the kind of opportunity and excitement that risk-taking offered.","Fashion for a long time was very elitist and difficult to get access to. The access I can now provide to my readers live from fashion shows with my iPhone was never, ever possible before.","Look at the way sports, music and film have become driving forces of popular culture. Fashion is the fourth pillar.","There's a side of fashion that's very analytical and data-oriented and methodical, but there's also a side of it that's just like magic. You can't quite put your finger on it, and you can't quite describe or prescribe a formula for how to get that magic exactly, but when you feel it and when you see it,you know that's what it is. It's magic.","I've always had an affinity for the fashion industry - I've always been drawn to it. But I grew up in Calgary in Canada, which, being a fairly isolated city, is not particularly known for having anything to do with fashion.","I had long had an instinct about there being a role for me in a creative industry. Maybe I didn't listen to that voice as much earlier on, but when it had become a deafening sound in my head I realised I had to go and explore it.","Combining technology and fashion shouldn't be about PR gimmicks - they should genuinely enhance the experience of buying, owning and experiencing a luxury product.","I'm not a designer, nor do I fancy myself a designer.","One person I find fascinating is J.Crew's Mickey Drexler. I would love to get into that brain and see how it works.","Not every brand needs to be on every social platform. Brands should have a very strategic objective, whether it's marketing or commercial. The biggest mistake a brand can make is to be on a social platform without a plan or the resources to manage it.","I have always been drawn to fashion from an aesthetic and consumer standpoint. I honestly never thought that I could take my business training and apply it here. I worked in retail and was into fashion. It was something I liked, and people trusted my opinion.","The power structures in fashion used to be limited to western Europe and the States. That's changing.","Leaving all the glamour and air-kissing aside, at the end of the day, fashion is about operations and getting things done. The best way to be successful, therefore, is to learn from the people who do it best.","As much as technology has made me so much more efficient, enabling me to run a small but global company from where I happen to be, at times it feels like the technology is running me, as opposed to the other way round.","I have met with hundreds of young fashion designers, hundreds of fashion startups, hundreds of CEOs and business leaders. All I do is get to ask questions of professionals in the industry. I learn from every conversation. It is the best education I could have.","You might call me an accidental entrepreneur.","The most amazing thing about Karl Lagerfeld is that no matter what you ask him, you will always get an interesting answer. We even exchanged notes about ponytails.","Not everyone can be successful selling fashion at $25,000 for a wedding outfit. Certain designers are able to do that. And there is only a certain amount of consumers who can do that. The real opportunity is in that $25 garment.","My advice to owners of fashion brands is that you have to give digital a seat at the board table. A lot of brands treat digital strategy as something on the side.","I focus on projects I am passionate about and only work with people I respect. Without these supportive teams, partners and clients, I could never work on so many things. I am fortunate that they see the value in the multiplicity of my work and how it all comes together in a kind of virtuous cycle.","The way the media tends to cover fashion is as this superfluous, vacuous industry. They focus on models and shows, but behind all that is a massive global industry."],"Imran Khan":["Win or lose today I am proud of the way my boys have played in the tournament.","It's more important to try to do something for the crores of poor people of my country.","A country that relies on aid? Death is better than that. It stops you from achieving your potential, just as colonialism did.","There can only be democracy when money is not allowed to be spent in Politics.","Spirituality does two things for you. One, you are forced to become more selfless, two, you trust to providence. The opposite of a spiritual man is a materialist. If I was a materialist I would be making lots of money doing endorsements, doing cricket commentary. I have no interest in that.","But I don't need to use politics as a way of making money.","I believed in myself. I never imagined myself as just an ordinary player.","The team which handles the pressure best, carries the day.","I have always believed that one should not be scared of losing, I think that really is the key.","Colonialism deprives you of your self-esteem and to get it back you have to fight to redress the balance.","I have fruit trees. Cows for fresh milk, yoghurt. My own wheat. I'm basically self-sufficient.","I feel an independent accountability commission should audit all government services.","I am basically a private person.","What I perceive, is above all justice, where everyone has the same law.","And when the pressure was on us, the team handled it very well. One has to learn to play well under pressure.","You don't kill your way to peace.","They do not understand Islam, and I think that is one area where perhaps I hope one day I will play a role in actually making people understand what we perceive Islam to be.","The team that is going to win is the one that does its homework the best by studying its opponents.","Personally I don't think solving corruption is such a big problem.","During my 21 years of playing cricket, I have never been approached by anyone or offered a bribe.","Cricket is a pressure game, and when it comes to an India-Pakistan match the pressure is doubled.","I don't know about whether I thought I would make it this big.","In most of Pakistan it is a feudal country. People are very scared and oppressed by authority. But when you move to these wilder areas, they are not so easily suppressed.","But having set myself these goals, I had to work really hard to achieve them.","Just give it everything you've got and bowl as fast as possible.","In Pakistan politics is hereditary.","At the moment we have a ruling class that has one law and the people the other.","The future of Indo-Pak cricket will depend on how the peace process goes.","In fact the experience at Oxford has really helped me later in life.","So for us any gain we had in election, one vote that we got, was a win.","People didn't wasn't the People's party to come in to power again, so they saw NS a viable alternative not us, because everyone knew we were not ready.","What most people didn't realize in the Western countries is that here its not a question of having supporters, its a question of getting these votes to the polling stations.","I did not lose this election, or had a bad result compared with what we might have got because of Islam.","If one area I felt it was a tough election was I couldn't see my young son and I couldn't see my wife a lot, but apart from that for her also it was an experience.","One is actually the democracy here, you know, people are, people assume that this election means that there is democracy in Pakistan. There is no democracy.","I wanted to be an outstanding player, that was my ambition.","But ultimately it comes down to how the team performs on the day.","Pakistan needs to have decentralisation and a good local government system.","If your house is burning, wouldn't you try and put out the fire?","The war on terror is the most insane and immoral war of all time. The Americans are doing what they did in Vietnam, bombing villages. But how can a civilised nation do this? How can you can eliminate suspects, their wives, their children, their families, their neighbours? How can you justify this?","Cross-cultural marriage is difficult, especially when one person has to live in another country. But I thought there was a very good chance of it working because people grow together if they have a common passion.","Because I'm anti-war, I've been called pro-Taliban.","Terrorism is you winning hearts and minds of people.","I want to have a president in the U.S. who tries to win the hearts and minds of the Muslim world.","When I came into politics I always thought there was a possibility I would be killed.","I am called an Islamic fundamentalist by Rushdie. My critics in Pakistan say I am a Zionist agent. I must be doing something right.","The Westoxified Pakistanis have been selling their souls and killing their own people for a few million dollars.","These so-called extremists in Pakistan should be brought into the mainstream; if you marginalize them, you radicalize them."],"Imre Kertesz":["What I discovered in Auschwitz is the human condition, the end point of a great adventure, where the European traveler arrived after his two-thousand-year-old moral and cultural history.","The Holocaust survivor who knows Auschwitz through the experience of suffering observes it all from the perspective assigned to him. He keeps silent or gives interviews to the Spielberg Foundation, he accepts the compensation payments promised him after a fifty-year delay, or, if he is prominent, he makes a speech in the Swedish Academy.","If the world is an objective reality that exists independently of us, then humans themselves, even in their own eyes, are nothing more than objects, and their life stories merely a series of disconnected historical accidents, which they may wonder at, but which they themselves have nothing to do with.","No one in my family wrote. And there was no real introduction. I suppose I somehow blundered into it when I was about six or seven years old. I was asked what present I would like, and, without knowing why, I responded that I would like a journal. It was a beautiful journal - so beautiful that I didn't want to sully it.","If there is such a thing as freedom, then there is no fate.","When we write about Auschwitz, we must know that Auschwitz, in a certain sense at least, suspended literature. One can only write a black novel about Auschwitz or - you should excuse the expression - a cheap serial, which begins in Auschwitz and is still not over.","In a democracy, you have to find a market niche, make sure a novel is 'interesting' and 'spectacular.' That may be the toughest censorship of all.","I have not changed my opinion that the Holocaust is a trauma of European civilization.","I was interned in Auschwitz for one year. I didn't bring back anything, except for a few jokes, and that filled me with shame. Then again, I didn't know what to do with this fresh experience. For this experience was no literary awakening, no occasion for professional or artistic introspection.","Modern life is organised so that you benefit at the expense of the other, and the most extreme example of that is a camp.","I think a man turns into a writer by editing his own texts.","Writing changed my life. It has an existential dimension, and that's the same for every writer. Every artist has a moment of awakening, of happening upon an idea that grabs hold of you, regardless of whether you are a painter or a writer.","It is often said of me - some intend it as a compliment, others as a complaint - that I write about a single subject: the Holocaust. I have no quarrel with that. Why shouldn't I accept, with certain qualifications, the place assigned to me on the shelves of libraries?","A book is either autobiography or a novel.","A good autobiography is like a document: a mirror of the age on which people can 'depend.' In a novel, by contrast, it's not the facts that matter, but precisely what you add to the facts.","The world of fiction is a sovereign world that comes to life in the author's head and follows the rules of art, of literature. And that is the major difference that is reflected in the form of the work, in its language and its plot. An author invents every aspect of a fiction, every detail.","I am no historian, but Hungary is a country which has never known democracy - and by that, I mean not a democratic political system, but an organic process which has mobilised the entire country's society. In the case of Hungary, this development was blocked by the growth of the Ottoman empire in the 16th century.","I came from two harsh dictatorships, Nazi and Stalinist. I never thought of becoming a writer as such, yet in a lucid moment, I recognised what I had to do."],"Imre Lakatos":["The clash between Popper and Kuhn is not about a mere technical point in epistemology.","If even in science there is no a way of judging a theory but by assessing the number, faith and vocal energy of its supporters, then this must be even more so in the social sciences: truth lies in power.","Einstein's results again turned the tables and now very few philosophers or scientists still think that scientific knowledge is, or can be, proven knowledge.","Philosophy of science without history of science is empty; history of science without philosophy of science is blind.","Blind commitment to a theory is not an intellectual virtue: it is an intellectual crime.","Indeed, this epistemological theory of the relation between theory and experiment differs sharply from the epistemological theory of naive falsificationism.","It would be wrong to assume that one must stay with a research programme until it has exhausted all its heuristic power, that one must not introduce a rival programme before everybody agrees that the point of degeneration has probably been reached.","Our empirical criterion for a series of theories is that it should produce new facts. The idea of growth and the concept of empirical character are soldered into one.","Research programmes, besides their negative heuristic, are also characterized by their positive heuristic.","The classical example of a successful research programme is Newton's gravitational theory: possibly the most successful research programme ever.","The positive heuristic of the programme saves the scientist from becoming confused by the ocean of anomalies.","There is no falsification before the emergence of a better theory."],"Imtiaz Ali":["I think I am a travel junkie, and I have never enjoyed anything else in my life more than travelling and going to places.","When you write a story, it just flows and you don't control it. It's subconscious.","The physical journey in my films is indicative of the internal journey that my characters take.","I was complexed and awkward that I was good for nothing and was always lying. I would lie to my school friends that I was a stud in my colony and to my colony friends that I was a stud in the school cricket and football teams, though I was in no team.","Through travel, you discover a new aspect to your personality. You discover things which you wouldn't seated in the confines of your home.","My father did irrigation jobs, and I would sometimes accompany him, and that gave me a taste of what was going on in the innards of India.","Coming from a middle class background, travel was always considered a luxury then, even if it meant going to a relative's place or a religious shrine.","Dilip Kumar was the only Bollywood hero who could make a girl shiver just by looking at her. If you don't believe it, ask your mom!","'Love Aaj Kal' is not really a road movie, but it does involve some travel.","I was interested in theatre and media and came to Mumbai to get a job. I imagined that the film industry would be a white building with producers sitting in different rooms, and you could walk in and meet them, and they would interview you and select you.","Anything I wanted to do and achieve has not been influential in my life, but my failures have.","I'm a big foodie. Hyderabadi cuisine is amazing, and the kind of mutton dishes available at some restaurants in the Old City is incredible.","I feel whatever an actor does on screen is something the actor 'does,' and what the director can do is to tell, talk or instruct. So, all the credit for an actor's performance goes to the actor alone.","I'm not the 'look at me' kind of a person. I do not like showing off in public or written about.","I just write characters, and somehow they happen to be a boy and a girl. When the story is put together, and their characters interwoven, they do end up together somehow.","I myself got married at a very young age. It has always intrigued me because marriage is very synthetic in an otherwise natural world.","I come from a middle class background. I have travelled a lot by trains and have lived in the world. It is a world I cannot get away from; I would not even want to.","I want to direct what I feel is interesting - not what is supposed to be my zone.","I have always tried to make profitable films because people's offices shut down if films fail, and I will do everything to avoid that.","I'm not educated about cinema or genres.","The film industry has been extremely welcoming to me. It's an industry which is biased to what they think is talent. If they think you can bring value to cinema, they'll support you.","I want all my films to look distinctly different, like some other directors I admire. But in a way, I can't really take myself completely out of the movies I make.","Especially on unexpected journeys, you have time; you can figure certain deeper things out, like who you are and what you want. That's why I enjoy journeys.","I try to travel as much as I can... I'm always looking for a reason to.","I enjoy scenes in films, which do not have the pressure of the story so much... and it flows. I've tried to go in that direction.","My job is to tell a story, and the decisions about the casting have to be honest.","The story of 'Highway' is completely about travel. It is about the fascination of travel to an extent that I don't want to even reach the destination and also being away from society gives you a certain view of the society, so that was the intention of the film.","Usually, you lose interest in a story beyond a certain point. But with 'Highway,' there was something very subtle, yet something very influential. I intended 'Highway' to be the first film that I ever made. Didn't happen.","All the conscious decisions that I have taken in my life have never borne fruit. Not even come close! So, I am just very happy not planning.","I think 'Rockstar' is more dear to me than any of my other films.","Sometimes I don't know whether a movie has been shot on film or in digital when I watch it in the theatres.","If a person wants to enjoy attention, he will create situations to get it.","I used to love Kapil Dev and, like any schoolboy, wanted to become a cricketer till I started dreaming of making movies.","I am a keen observer of my own films; I also try to discover myself through the movies I make.","I was called to audition for a play when I was very young, following which I continued to act as well as write and direct. When I moved to Delhi and joined Hindu College, theatre became a very big part of my life.","I enjoy looking beyond the obvious and look at the stories happening all around me - you kind of formulate things in your mind and get excited about them.","Expenditure can't really guarantee a great experience. I don't even like shopping; I've never bought stuff for myself, and everything I wear are gifts from my brothers, friends and people."],"Ina Garten":["I try to greet my friends with a drink in my hand, a warm smile on my face, and great music in the background, because that's what gets a dinner party off to a fun start.","Instead of going out to dinner, buy good food. Cooking at home shows such affection. In a bad economy, it's more important to make yourself feel good.","Take one flower that you like and get lots of them. And don't try to 'arrange' them. It's surprisingly hard to do a flower arrangement the way a florist does one. Instead, bunch them all together or put them in a series of small vases all down the table.","I like almonds as a snack - keeps your energy up but doesn't fill you up.","I've taught myself how to use good, fresh ingredients and to prepare them as simply as possible by cooking only to enhance their intrinsic flavors.","Grilled cheese and tomato soup is the ultimate comfort meal.","I love to take something ordinary and make it really special.","Creme Brulee is the ultimate 'guy' dessert. Make it and he'll follow you anywhere.","My extravagance is my garden - it's the first thing I look at every morning when I wake up. It gives me so much pleasure.","In the summer you want fresh, light and sort of quick things; in winter you want things that are comforting, so your body really tells you you want to go towards potatoes, apples, fennel, things that are warm and comforting. And loin of pork.","The thing about all my food is that everything is a remembered flavor. Maybe it's something I had as a child or maybe it's something I had in Milan, but I want it to taste better than you ever thought.","When I wrote 'Barefoot in Paris,' I wanted to make simple recipes that you could make at home that tasted like French classics.","People have more fun if they don't eat so much they have to be taken home in an ambulance.","I always like to have flowers on the table. I think they make it look special.","I always have music. I love it to be very upbeat. When you're having drinks, I like something like Cesaria Evora. During dinner, I like the much more traditional - old Frank Sinatra and things like that.","They say that gardens look better when they are created by loving gardeners rather than by landscapers, because the garden is more tended to and cared for. The same thing goes for cooking. I only cook for people I love.","I've lived in the Hamptons since 1978, when I first bought my store Barefoot Contessa.","I absolutely adore Thanksgiving. It's the only holiday I insist on making myself.","My mother would never let me in the kitchen. I always wanted to cook, but I was never allowed to. Her view of the world was, 'Cooking is my job, and studying is your job.' I think, in retrospect, she didn't like the chaos. She was very orderly. It had to be her way.","I measure everything, because I always think that if I've spent so much time making sure this recipe was exactly the way I want it, why would I want to throw things into a pot?","I'm really a scientist. I follow recipes exactly - until I decide not to. And then I'll follow something else exactly. I may decide I could turn this peach tart into a plum tart, but if I'm following a recipe, I follow it exactly.","I use other cookbooks for inspiration. I must say I tend to cook from my own cookbooks for parties.","The most important thing for having a party is that the hostess is having fun. I'm very organized. I make a plan for absolutely everything. I never have anything that has to be cooked while the guests are there. The only thing I might have to do is take something out of the oven and carve it.","I don't like sitting at a table that's too large, where everyone is too far apart. That's a party killer.","The most overrated tool: a pasta maker. Why make it when you can buy it? It's a lot of work!","I love Alton Brown's show 'Good Eats,' about the chemistry of food. It's really thoughtful.","If you think about a Thanksgiving dinner, it's really like making a large chicken.","I time everything. I'm a scientist at heart.","Never let 'em see you sweat. Guests feel guilty if they think you've worked too hard to make dinner for them - which of course you have!","The dirty little secret is that I grew up in a household where there were no carbohydrates allowed, ever. No cookies, no bread, no potatoes, no rice. My mother was very extreme in terms of what she served. Since I left home more than 40 years ago, I've been making it right for myself.","You don't have to do everything from scratch. Nobody wants to make puff pastry!","I worked for the Office of Management and Budget in the White House, on nuclear energy policy. But I decided it would be much more fun to have a specialty food store, so I left Washington D.C. and moved to the Hamptons. And how glad I am that I did!","If it's a cocktail party, I generally make five or six different things, and I try to choose recipes that feel like a meal: a chicken thing, a fish or shrimp thing, maybe two vegetable things, and I think it's fun to end the cocktail party with a sweet thing.","I learned that the hardest party to pull off successfully is Saturday night dinner. This meal is expected to be elaborate: appetizers, first course, dinner, dessert, and coffee. People arrive at 7:30 or 8 p.m. and stay for hours - definitely past my bedtime - and they all go home exhausted.","My favorite fall or winter lunch is big steaming bowls of soup. I usually invite people for around 12:30 and have two hearty soups like shrimp corn chowder and lentil sausage soup, which can be made a day or two ahead.","There's something really wonderful about a party where you help yourself. Of course, first you get what you really want. But 'family style' service also really encourages people to connect with one another."],"Ina May Gaskin":["The best a health care system can do is to equip itself to meet the needs of each individual woman and birth. Those needs run the gamut from undisturbed home birth to planned cesarean section.","It's very rare to see an undisturbed birth in a modern U.S. teaching hospital, but when you see a woman who isn't frightened, who's giving birth without interference, you stand back in awe and realize how little needed you are except in the rare circumstance.","If birth matters, midwives matter. In Europe, there are hospitals where the cesarean rate is less than 10%, and you'll find midwives in these hospitals, you'll see a lot less re-admissions with infections and complications, and you'll see a lot less injury to mothers.","We midwives and physicians have a lot to teach each other.","I had to learn not to let anyone push me around, to be brave and to say things I knew might make people mad.","It's good to laugh at times that feel inappropriate.","I dreaded having a boring life when I grew up. And I certainly can't complain about being bored.","I know of no country in the world that has passed a law specifically denying a woman's right to choose where she intends to give birth."],"Inara George":["Obviously Hall & Oates wasn't overlooked by the masses in terms of the record sales.","I think a show is for fun, and the thing about playing live is that you make mistakes, and that's what's sort of exciting about it.","There's a certain attitude to Los Angeles.","I was raised in Topanga Canyon. It's an eclectic community up in the Santa Monica mountains. A lot of musicians lived there - Joni Mitchell, Neil Young - as well as artists and craftspeople.","I have three older brothers, and we all have different combinations of parents. My father was the best man at my mom's first wedding! And my brother's mother - my dad's first wife - is the sister to my mom's first husband's second wife. So my brothers are both stepcousins and stepbrothers. It's very '70s rock.","I do think that I can sing, though I actually like voices I can't imitate."],"Inbee Park":["Whenever I'd go to restaurants, the main chef came out and was cooking for me, and he's asking me how the food is. I get, like, VIP service, so it's weird.","I feel the happiest when I'm at the golf course. And I feel calm when I'm on the golf course. I think I'm just a much better person when I'm on the golf course.","I think I'm really good at forgetting about golf when I'm off the golf course.","Talking to my mental coach definitely helps. I talk to her every week. Yeah, I mean, she's been helping me a lot, too.","Outside the golf course, I feel the pressure, and I feel what everybody else is feeling. But on the golf course, it's just the golf ball and clubs. And when I have that, it just puts a lot of pressure off of me. It just makes me very calm looking at it, yeah.","As a person, to inspire some young girls and give them something to look at and give them something to play for, I think is such a great position to be in. I'm glad that I can follow all of the great Korean players' footsteps.","When I'm off the golf course, I feel the pressure, but I try to concentrate on the golf course.","Sometimes, all the interviews, those are the toughest thing for me, but once you really start to do it a lot and start to get used to it, I can find some fun in those parts, too. Because playing golf is the easiest thing for me, and that's something I'm so used to; that's why it was always easy.","This is what I love to do. And if pressure is something that comes with playing good golf, that's something a professional golfer has to handle.","Wanting more majors, wanting more wins, almost feels like I think I'm being too greedy.","I have a mental coach in Korea, and I talk to her every week before the tournament, during the tournament and try to talk to her and try to get a little bit of the pressure off.","There are calm Korean players and not calm. There are calm Western players.","I just like to stay a little quiet and just do my own thing. If I win a little more, I think I'll get a little bit more attention.","I feel pressure, but my emotions just don't show that much in my face.","I just love playing in major championships.","I experienced American golf courses when I was younger and played a lot of USGA and AJGA tournaments.","The first win came very quick, and I didn't know what it meant to win a major championship. I was a teenager, I was very young. I didn't know what I was doing. I just needed some time to get settled in on the tour."],"India Arie":["When I perform, I'm just very much just being myself.","Our food choices show up on our body.","When it comes down to the song writing, I'm just very slow - very slow. Because the songs are about my life, so I'm doing emotional work on myself.","Between '06 and '09, I dealt with pain by eating. And I was like, 'Oh, crap, eating makes you gain weight!'","Listening to 'Songs in the Key of Life' always puts me in a good mood.","It's important to have a place where you can recharge. Everybody's is different, but I do think it should entail quiet because it needs to be where you hear your spirit most clearly. For me, that's the prayer room in my apartment. And since my home is 700 square feet, I mean the coat closet near the front door.","Just like the air you breathe or the water you drink, music shapes you. The trouble is, most people don't use it to spread love and healing. But I think music can make a social contribution if you're responsible with it.","For the first ten years of my career, I felt suffocated. People constantly stood over me while I tried to create. And in 2009, I hit rock bottom. I couldn't find myself because I was looking to be defined by the music industry or by being number one on the Billboard charts.","So many people have been abused. It's not rare; it's a very common human experience, and we survive.","I was born in love with music. My mother is a singer. Many of my aunts and uncles on my mother's side are musical. My grandparents sang and played blues piano. It's literally in my blood.","To spread love, healing, peace, and joy is my mission in life - and so I speak up.","I am on an album with theater icon Billy Porter called the 'Soul of Richard Rodgers.' Our duet is called 'Carefully Taught.'","It's not my place to say how Zoe Saldana perceives herself, and I can't say how anybody else perceives her, either. I see her as a black person of Hispanic origin, but I don't even know what that really means, because I don't know anything about race and Hispanic culture.","Your soul is between you and God.","Nina Simone sacrificed so much to be as bold as she was about being black and about being female in an era where that could have cost her life.","I loved her music and the fact that she was a classically trained pianist and that her voice was so unique, but what made Nina Simone my hero is that I had never seen anyone in the public eye who looked anything like me at all, ever.","I'm really judgmental, especially about things that I feel make my life harder.","What I love about Stevie Wonder is the way he makes people feel. He's one of the best examples of how music can heal.","I've never said anything that I didn't want to say on a record, ever.","In my opinion, you just have to make the music. Make the music and work as hard as you can to get it out there.","I'm kind of like a folk singer mixed with soul, but I feel like if you really are a lover of hip-hop music, make the beat banging as possible and then put the message in so that people get the honey with the medicine.","In hindsight, I feel like I made the right decision to choose production that would get played on black radio.","Joe Sample was one of my heroes. I met him at the Curacao Jazz festival, and I fanned out like he was the Beatles!","What I love about Christmas music is it stays around every year and comes back.","You deal with what comes to you. If it's something you don't like, you deal with it the best you can. If it's something that you love, you rise to the occasion.","Sound is energy, and that energy resonates with your energy. And it gives you a certain feeling.","I've been trying to arrive at a person who is self-defined and able to make my own mistakes rather than having other people make them for me.","If we can just focus our attention where it matters, we can effect change.","I am really excited to be partnering with Palmer's Cocoa Butter Formula. Aside from being a longtime fan of their products, they're a family business with a strong ethical foundation, and that makes us a great match.","I didn't even listen to Bob Marley until I was 17.","I like Brandy a lot. She's a vocal prodigy.","I think anyone who is ever on TV is a role model for somebody.","I like being a role model - people have told me that I am a role model for empowered women, but I don't see myself that way.","I'm not just making rhymes and making melodies. I'm expressing my true life force, energy.","Everybody has their own path. I got mine.","Just to keep myself balanced, I do things like yoga and meditation.","The thing that makes me feel most alive is knowing that there's something that I have to do that I'm afraid of.","Saying things on paper that I would never, ever say, and saying things to myself, admitting things to myself, about myself and my personality, just putting it on paper, is how I deal with emotional pain.","I feel like I'm always gonna sing and write songs because it's me.","Neo-soul is really less about a sound than it is about a look, in my opinion.","I wouldn't be back in my 20s for anything.","I don't really consider myself a teacher. I think - like, I have opinions like everyone else, and I just share my opinions.","One of the things that helped me to be confident is to be the kind of musician that I respect. I always liked musicians who wrote their own songs, and so I started writing my own songs.","There's a difference in being opinionated and judgmental; I'm still trying to figure out what that fine line is - I think we are all.","When someone is themselves through their music, it's soul music. James Taylor is soul music to me 'cause it's just him talking about him. It doesn't have anything to do with black or growing up in the church; it's where it comes from. It's just soul music.","I know that I pray a lot, and I take time for myself.","I write about my experiences, so a lot of times, I do write about people.","I always pray when I write songs that my spirit guides, or whoever is with me, inspiring me, would let me speak the truth.","At 16, I started really loving country music, and Collin Raye just had the most amazing ballads!","Everything in my music has always been emotionally and spiritually motivated... But after I started doing yoga, the place where I came from changed drastically.","I always loved music, but I didn't know if I could be the kind of artist that makes a difference.","In Denver, all we really had was pop radio, so I grew up on all that late '70s pop stuff - Billy Joel, James Taylor, Lionel Richie, Elton John, Steve Miller and Toto. Great love songs and really hooky and melodic music - I have all of that stuff in my heart.","Music lives in my mother - she's played in bands in Detroit and toured and did the whole thing. So I have somebody who's done it all to just talk to. And we write songs together.","If I don't have the right clothes, I feel weird walking out; I don't feel comfortable in what I have on. I have different colors that I want to wear on different days because it makes me feel different.","Even when it doesn't look good, it's always good. Even the worst thing, there's always something good that comes out of it. I've learned that.","If I were not a black artist but I was still singing, playing guitar, and singing ballads that are spiritual and cerebral, I'd be easier to market because people accept that from white female singer-songwriters faster.","I always felt like - I mean, I was told, really - I couldn't go too far with the productions because it didn't appeal to black radio. It wasn't until I decided I was going to do what I wanted to do or I was going to quit that I empowered myself. I took my power back.","In this era, soul is not a sound or a color: it's an intention.","That's the kind of music I want SoulBird to represent: music with intelligence and heart, music that moves people in their souls and their bodies. Music with wings.","I do believe in prophecy.","Songs like 'Peaceful World' and songs that are responsible with their lyrics and talk about love and harmony can take the forefront and do something for real.","I've always wanted my music to serve a certain purpose.","'Open Door' was a world music project and bilingual. It was in Hebrew and English, and it's great. I do think it's really beautiful. But it's very emotional and very dark - in a good way.","It was challenging getting myself into the mindset to lose the weight. Once I got there, the weight dropped off quickly.","I had been on what seemed to be a hiatus to the outside world, but I was actually working very hard on my health, my emotional health, and my business.","Could a person really make a social contribution through music consciously? I mean, beyond making a person happy to hear the song and more making a social contribution consciously through your music? For me, Stevie Wonder is the paragon of that. And I didn't want to be Stevie Wonder, but I did want to do what he does.","I'm in show business, and I'm an entertainer, but I also see myself as an artist doing social and spiritual work.","It took me almost wanting to retire to realize that you need to ask for what you need. Everybody needs something different, but whatever it is you need, you need to ask for it and figure out how to get it.","Now that I have better producer chops, a country album is something I want to do one day. I don't know who's going to put it out. But when I do, I don't think people will call it 'country music.' They'll probably call it 'neo-soul.'","The thought crossed my mind about not wanting to alienate my fan base, but I don't know what would alienate them or bring them in, so I decided not to think about it.","I made a conscious decision when I was recording 'Acoustic Soul' to - and this is one of my mantras - follow the music and let the chips fall where they may.","I don't want the world to get any worse. I want to make it better.","For me, the healing process starts with graciousness and forgiveness.","I know the things I say go out of my own mouth and into my own ears.","The subconscious doesn't distinguish sarcasm and jokes. It just accepts what it hears. That's the power of words.","I've spent my entire life trying to figure out why I was different than everybody else. Why is my voice so deep? Why am I so muscular?","Nobody looked like me when I was growing up. None of the kids were as big as me, or as serious as me, or listened to the same music.","When I was growing up, I only saw really brown people on 'The Cosby Show,' and they were rich, and their parents were doctors. It wasn't like my home."],"India de Beaufort":["My personal style is ever changing.","School was rough for me. I was a good student in middle school, but high school wasn't so fun. I still pulled through, though! I excelled in art, fashion, history and English literature - anything creative. Math and science I struggled a bit more in.","Every trend in my high school was terrible! I used to wear my hair in a tight bun and let two long pieces hang in the front. I'd also wear really dark eyeliner and bright pink eyeshadow. For some reason, my friends and I thought it was really fashionable to wear a short tie with our uniforms.","I always knew I wanted to work in entertainment, but I actually really wanted to be a singer more than an actress.","My dream evening is wearing my sweatpants, eating something delicious and watching TV with my boyfriend.","My style is quite clean, vintage, and almost French in a way.","It's fun to be an actor and dress up, but I'm happy being me and just loving accepting my personal style.","I'm a big fan of people like Rachel Bilson and Kate Bosworth. I think they're so chic and have this cool edgy-rocker feel. For about a month I tried to do that, but what I realized is that I can't be anything other than what I am.","I had no interest in being an actress what so ever, and when I was about 14 or 15, I was signed to a company in England. They owned a children's TV show which they put me in as a singer, and I was on the show for three years, and I left the show when I was 18 and started looking for a record contract.","You're a smaller fish in the U.S. There's just so many more TV shows, and actors, and actresses. Where as in the U.K. you're in a much smaller market there.","I have a sewing machine that I adore, and I spend a lot of time sitting in front of it when I'm not working. And any excuse to paint or draw or do something artistic with my hands really gets me going. Definitely aspiring.","Ballyhoo is for your classic girl, who is fun and fearless. This is for the girl who is not afraid to dress fun.","High school is the time to find yourself and to explore with fashion and create your own identity."],"Indiana Evans":["I admire Cate Blanchett as an actor: that's my ultimate goal. To be as good as she is!","I had been watching 'Home and Away' for quite a while, so joining the cast was quite weird. The show is so fast-paced, and at first it was overwhelming, but at the same time was quite laid back.","When you do a remake, there's a lot of pressure because people always love the original.","I have always been ambitious about getting a U.S. role, and if ever there is some frustration, it is still encouraging to get close to big roles because it implies there is somewhere to go.","I've always thought Juliette Lewis was great.","You have to remember I've been working with adults since I was 12 - they were my peers, and it has an effect, for sure."],"Indira Gandhi":["Forgiveness is a virtue of the brave.","There are two kinds of people, those who do the work and those who take the credit. Try to be in the first group; there is less competition there.","Winning or losing of the election is less important than strengthening the country.","You cannot shake hands with a clenched fist.","I have lived a long life, and I am proud that I spend the whole of my life in the service of my people. I am only proud of this and nothing else. I shall continue to serve until my last breath, and when I die, I can say, that every drop of my blood will invigorate India and strengthen it.","People tend to forget their duties but remember their rights.","Martyrdom does not end something, it only a beginning.","My father was a statesman, I am a political woman. My father was a saint. I am not.","The power to question is the basis of all human progress.","I have already reached out to the janata, and I am only trying to acquaint myself with people's problems.","There is not love where there is no will.","You must learn to be still in the midst of activity and to be vibrantly alive in repose.","We have to prove to the disinherited majority of the world that ecology and conservation will not work against their interest but will bring an improvement in their lives.","I do not like carving the world into segments; we are one world.","One must beware of ministers who can do nothing without money, and those who want to do everything with money.","Have a bias toward action - let's see something happen now. You can break that big plan into small steps and take the first step right away.","A nation' s strength ultimately consists in what it can do on its own, and not in what it can borrow from others.","If I die a violent death, as some fear and a few are plotting, I know that the violence will be in the thought and the action of the assassins, not in my dying.","If I see something dirty or untidy, I have to clean it up.","I am not a person to be pressured - by anybody or any nation.","Even if I died in the service of the nation, I would be proud of it. Every drop of my blood... will contribute to the growth of this nation and to make it strong and dynamic.","The environmental problems of developing countries are not the side effects of excessive industrialisation but reflect the inadequacy of development.","The collective judgment of the electorate must be respected.","We do not wish to impoverish the environment any further, and yet we cannot for a moment forget the grim poverty of large numbers of people. Are not poverty and need the greatest polluters?","I think basically I'm lazy, but I have a housewife's mentality when I go about my job.","There exists no politician in India daring enough to attempt to explain to the masses that cows can be eaten.","All the people who fought for freedom were my heroes. I mean, that was the sort of story I liked reading... freedom struggles and so on.","I'm certainly not a workaholic.","Happiness is a state of mind, you know. I don't think you are permanently happy. One is happy about certain things and not so happy about others.","I am frequently attacked.","I was happy to be with my parents. I didn't see very much of them, so I was very happy when my father was there and out of jail.","All my games were political games; I was, like Joan of Arc, perpetually being burned at the stake.","Wearing khadi was a badge of honour. It was something one was proud to do.","I don't think my father was my mentor.","My son had nothing to do with policy or decision making, nor did I discuss the elections or any other matter with him.","I've never turned to anybody for advice and counsel. Even when I was a very small child, I had to stand on my feet because of the circumstances of those times, and somehow, the circumstances have remained more or less the same. I have to take my own decisions.","This is why we feel that democracy's important: because democracy allows you to have small explosions and therefore avoid the bigger explosions.","The people have nothing to fear of me; people have never feared me.","There are grave misgivings that the discussion on ecology may be designed to distract attention from the problems of war and poverty.","On the one hand, the rich look askance at our continuing poverty - on the other, they warn us against their own methods."],"Indira Varma":["I like how small you can be on TV.","I love theater. I also love radio. I love language.","I don't want to be an absent mother. Otherwise, why have children?","I depend on good editors and a good director.","An actor matures with experiences, and the more the emotions he/she has been through, the greater the intensity of performances.","Youth is beautiful.","I've love the challenge of doing something new. Bollywood is magical."],"Indra Devi":["Yoga is a way to freedom. By its constant practice, we can free ourselves from fear, anguish and loneliness.","Like water which can clearly mirror the sky and the trees only so long as its surface is undisturbed, the mind can only reflect the true image of the Self when it is tranquil and wholly relaxed.","Yoga is an art and science of living.","We must keep both our femininity and our strength.","Freedom is living without chains.","We've got our own daylight to get bad thoughts away, and we talk with that light - our star in our heart. We take away what's unimportant.","Laughter drives shouting away.","Yoga means union, in all its significances and dimensions.","Men have to descend from their pedestal and learn how to be more broadminded and spiritual.","We women must listen to our inner voice. It is easier for women to do this as they are not afraid to say what they feel.","Women must not shout back when their husbands come home and shout at them for any reason.","Tell your husbands any bad news when everything is calm, not just as they come through the door.","I do not belong to any religion. Everything is between God and myself."],"Indra Nooyi":["Leadership is hard to define and good leadership even harder. But if you can get people to follow you to the ends of the earth, you are a great leader.","As a leader, I am tough on myself and I raise the standard for everybody; however, I am very caring because I want people to excel at what they are doing so that they can aspire to be me in the future.","To be a CEO is a calling. You should not do it because it is a job. It is a calling, and you have got to be involved in it with your head, heart and hands. Your heart has got to be in the job; you got to love what you do; it consumes you. And if you are not willing to get into the CEO job that way, there is no point getting into it.","Most companies target women as end users, but few are effectively utilizing female employees when it comes to innovating for female consumers. When women are empowered in the design and innovation process, the likelihood of success in the marketplace improves by 144%!","I play the guitar when I want to relax. But to play the guitar, you cut the nails. So one day, I'll cut the nails off.","Just because you are CEO, don't think you have landed. You must continually increase your learning, the way you think, and the way you approach the organization. I've never forgotten that.","When you assume negative intent, you're angry. If you take away that anger and assume positive intent, you will be amazed. Your emotional quotient goes up because you are no longer almost random in your response.","At the end of the day, don't forget that you're a person, don't forget you're a mother, don't forget you're a wife, don't forget you're a daughter.","In 1994, when I came to PepsiCo, there were really three businesses. They were soft drinks, which included both bottling and the concentrate company. There were salted snacks - Frito Lay. And restaurants where we had, we all talk of them, Pizza Hut, KFC and a whole bunch of casual dining chains.","I pick up the details that drive the organization insane. But sweating the details is more important than anything else.","I think innovation as a discipline needs to go back and get rethought and revived. There are so many models to talk about innovation, there are so many typologies of innovation, and you have to find a good innovation metric that truly captures the innovation performance of a company.","Do you remember campaigns like 'Keep America beautiful'? What about 'Buckle up'? I believe we need an approach like this to attack obesity. Let's be a good industry that does 100% of what it possibly can - not grudgingly, but willingly.","My father was an absolutely wonderful human being. From him I learned to always assume positive intent. Whatever anybody says or does, assume positive intent.","The one thing I have learned as a CEO is that leadership at various levels is vastly different. When I was leading a function or a business, there were certain demands and requirements to be a leader. As you move up the organization, the requirements for leading that organization don't grow vertically; they grow exponentially.","The distance between number one and number two is always a constant. If you want to improve the organization, you have to improve yourself and the organization gets pulled up with you. That is a big lesson. I cannot just expect the organization to improve if I don't improve myself and lift the organization, because that distance is a constant.","When it comes to women, there has been a tendency to define women in sports in the context of their relationships - they watch games because their husbands watch. They're interested because their kids play a sport. They buy tickets to a sporting event because it's a way to spend time with family.","Every year in consulting is like three years in the corporate world because you have multiple clients, multiple issues - you grow so much.","PepsiCo did not have a woman in the senior ranks, nor a foreign-born person who was willing to think differently.","I asked my parents for permission to study in America and they were so sure that I wouldn't get in and get a scholarship that they encouraged me to try. So I applied to Yale and got an excellent scholarship. I then worked for the Boston Consulting Group for six and half years.","I'm very honest - brutally honest. I always look at things from their point of view as well as mine. And I know when to walk away.","Is Naked Juice a beverage, or is it a snack? I think we can liquefy snacks or snackify liquids.","When I came to America in 1978, I was a huge sports fan - the problem was, my sport was cricket. Shockingly enough, no one wanted to talk cricket with me!","Before blogs, it was all about physical presence. We used to send out videos and audiotapes to communicate. Blogging and the Internet allow us to engage in a lot more real time conversations as opposed to a one-way dump of information or a message.","Lots are written about how 'she shows up at board meetings in the saree.' My God, I have never worn a saree to board meetings; people play it out in different ways. I think I have never shied away from the fact that I am an Indian, and I don't intend to, but you can be at home with both cultures.","BlogHer is an incredibly important conference because it really taps into the power of women. It gives women an ability to do what they do - take care of the home, go to work - and, at the same time, spread their power through the power of the digital world.","By five or six, when the heels start to hurt, I kick off my shoes and walk bare feet. But that's not a big deal. Nobody else is at the office at that time, and as for singing loudly, I don't sing loudly. I might hum a tune at times when I am thinking about something, but that's all fine.","Companies the size of PepsiCo is like running a little republic, there is no question about it. The only difference is that I don't have to worry about the media hounding me every day, on every word that I say. I have a board of directors that runs the country in the interest of the stake holders.","Blogging and the Internet allow us to engage in a lot more real time conversations as opposed to a one-way dump of information or a message.","When I grew up there was no web, blogging or tweeting. In fact, where I grew up there was not even television! I met a lot of my friends in school and in college, and they are still my friends today.","I grew up in a Hindu household but went to a Roman Catholic school. I grew up with a mother who said, 'I'll arrange a marriage for you at 18,' but she also said that we could achieve anything we put our minds to an encourage us to dream of becoming prime minister or president.","There will never be a replacement for that ongoing physical contact. But I don't think blogging is meant to replace the face-to-face of friendships and meetings. Blogging is a way to keep in touch with a larger group of people on an ongoing basis, in a more efficient way.","My guilty pleasures are the websites where you can look at the fashions and see how different outfits will look. You can even take a picture of yourself and download it and play with the fashions! I love playing with these websites to see what I can learn.","Not only do we have to change the food we eat... we have to educate people about what they can eat appropriately.","When you have to do as much as women do, the Internet allows you to - from home - figure out a way to extend your reach and power in the world. It allows you to do what job you've done traditionally, and create aspirations by carrying on a job and using the Internet to amplify everything you're doing.","I don't think the deficit of the country is a Republican issue or a Democratic issue. I think it's a country issue. I don't think worrying about the reindustrialization of America is a Republican or Democratic issue.","Each and every one of us has unknowingly played a part in the obesity problem.","Slice Mango - something that, you know, is a phenomenal drink, but mango is not a flavour that is easily liked by many people in the West. People in Latin America like it. But we do a lot of Mango in India.","Anything that's done to address unemployment in terms of massive stimulus spending is going to exacerbate deficits. And anything that's done to address deficits in the short-term is going to exacerbate unemployment.","We are in a bit of a policy box and it's going to require us being willing to give up one of the two, which is it's okay to take on more deficits but lets put in some massive spending. Alternatively to say, 'we're going to go through structural unemployment for a while because we want to address deficits.'","I've been around the bend in corporations.","When I was president of the company, I said, 'Okay, I can do this - piece of cake.' Then when you are the CEO, the responsibilities multiply enormously because you worry about everything.","But the good news was that my elder sister refused to get married straight away and I couldn't get married until she did so I had the licence to go off and dream.","After PepsiCo, I do want to go to Washington. I want to give back.","I read every country's perspective on an issue. I also play many games like Bridge, Scrabble and Sudoku online.","The medical system in the United States is among the best in the world, if not the best. What if we were to make the United States a medical destination? That would bring a lot of people here because there are a lot of sick people around the world. If they can get U.S. treatment, they will take it, but now think about what that will do.","PepsiCo is a $63 billion company. Half the company is snacks, and half the company is beverages. We have a glorious snacks business and a glorious beverage business. We are extremely profitable. We are growing.","When I was a kid, I would come home from school, throw my bag, go out to play. My daughter comes home from school, throws her bag, goes to play, but sitting in front of the computer because their definition of play has changed. They don't go out to play. They play on the computer with their friends.","As a CEO of a large company, clearly we need policies in the U.S. government that are pro-business, because at the end of the day, we all work within the framework of a country's policies.","Food service is a growth area for PepsiCo.","I spent some time at a university for traditional Chinese medicine. There's a resurgence of people eating according to traditional Chinese medicine. So our challenge is, How do you marry traditional Chinese medicine with PepsiCo's products?","What I would not do is flaunt my Indianess by wearing a saree to work everyday, because it distracts from the job. So, I would not do that. When in Rome, do as the Romans do. Social events are different. If I feel comfortable in a saree for a social event, I wear it.","When I talk football with my friends, I don't talk about Tom Brady's hair. I talk about how he handles the blitz, or how he runs his offense. I talk as a fan. I don't want pink jerseys, and I don't want dumbed-down content. I want to be treated as a real fan - because I am proud to be one.","India is a country with huge potential, and it remains an attractive high priority market for PepsiCo. We believe we have only scratched the surface of long term growth opportunities that exist for PepsiCo and our partners.","I hear my own daughters talking about big companies polluting the environment, and then I realise they are talking about companies of which one I am running. But when I tell them to read the things we are doing, then they realise we are doing good things. But millennials are really a great lot."],"Ines de La Fressange":["It is true that in France, women put on less things. If they have a necklace, they don't put on earrings; if they have nail polish, they don't put on all their rings and all their bracelets.","Often something more simple would be better. Sometimes I put things together - a shirt, a sweater, a jacket - and it's too complicated. I would have worn only a v-neck sweater, it would have been better. It's not the clothes but it's how you wear them sometimes.","I had no luck when I started out as a model. I keep telling people that it's the only career in the world that you can't choose for yourself - you have to be chosen.","One thing Della Valle taught me is the power to say no if something isn't right. That mattered even over sales.","Overall when you work in fashion, you're always in a rush. You're always a little late, always in a hurry. Every single moment's important, so you never have enough time to do what you want to do. It's ridiculous.","People imagine I am always in a Bentley with pearls and diamonds and black glasses and Karl Lagerfeld next to me.","I saw a lot of haute couture all my childhood, and without knowing it I've learned from when I was a child to recognise beautiful fabrics.","I would love to live in India or in the South of France, but Roger Vivier doesn't have offices yet in New Delhi or Jaipur.","Even if you live in a tiny village, there's an Internet site. It's quite easy to find clothes, but sometimes women don't know how to mix them.","Matching shoes and bags immediately age you by 10 years.","Buying a matching blouse and skirt from the same store is a crime. A clever mix of chic and cheap hits the jackpot. Know how to mix styles and labels.","If you don't feel comfortable in a plunging sweater, skin-tight jeans and killer heels, go home and change."],"Inga Cadranel":["People who drive Jeeps are people who like to do outdoor activities.","You would never see me driving around in a sports car. I feel like you're so low and squish-able by transport trucks.","It's not that I don't want a fast car. I like the speed. I'm just not the type of person who finds a sports car a sexy car.","I like guys who drive trucks.","When we were growing up, we had all these crazy, in-your-face guys around the house. For us, it was like, 'Ugh! Actors again.'"],"Inga Muscio":["Words outlive people, institutions, civilizations. Words spur images, associations, memories, inspirations and synapse pulsations. Words send off physical resonations of thought into the nethersphere. Words hurt, soothe, inspire, demean, demand, incite, pacify, teach, romance, pervert, unite, divide. Words be powerful.","Grown-ups and children are not readily encouraged to unearth the power of words. Adults are repeatedly assured a picture is worth a thousand of them, while the playground response to almost any verbal taunt is 'Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me.' I don't beg so much as command to differ.","Love is a positive, symbiotic, reciprocal flow between two or more entities.","I dance. A lot. I work grief and sadness out of my body when I dance, and I bring in joy and rhythm.","Ancient, woman-centered words and beliefs never, like, fall off the planet. Having long done taken on a life of their own, they - like womankind - evolve, and survive. Chameleon style.","I have a really dark, rich, thick sense of humor.","I work grief and sadness out of my body when I dance, and I bring in joy and rhythm.","Abuse is the means in which violence retards love.","Describing passive violence in this culture is kinda like someone who is drowning in the middle of the ocean giving you the low-down on water. The only way you can really understand passive violence is by going somewhere far, far away from phones, news, TV, the Internet.","Passive violence can be as simple as someone honking their horn at you for not turning fast enough when the light changes. And it can be highly complex, like when your co-worker undermines all of your work relationships by spreading rumors and lies about you. That's how passive violence rolls.","I have laughter dates with myself, where I find comics on YouTube and watch them. Louis C.K. was my first laughter date a couple years ago. I'll also watch those videos of people doing idiotic things. That cracks me up."],"Inge de Bruijn":["I love to smile.","And I mean I never doubt anybody's record.","I always think it's because of you know hard work, hard training. And if Susie's training hard, you know, why can't I train hard to get a world record. I'm doing the same thing.","Yeah, that's what kind of, we get the idea a little bit yeah, because other people from different countries also try as hard as they can to get a medal or a gold medal in the Olympic Games. And you know, if they can work hard, we can work hard as well.","Well concerning the world records that I did, I think it helps a lot to me, yeah. I think it's a very individual thing because I heard some people say, like, oh I don't like it at all. But I definitely, for me it really made a big difference."],"Ingmar Bergman":["I'm very, very lazy. I love to sit in a chair and look out the window and do nothing.","I throw a spear into the darkness. That is intuition. Then I must send an army into the darkness to find the spear. That is intellect.","The individualists stare into each other's eyes and yet deny each other's existence. We walk in circles, so limited by our own anxieties that we can no longer distinguish between true and false, between the gangster's whim and the purest ideal.","The demons are innumerable, appear at the most inconvenient times, and create panic and terror. But I have learnt that if I can master the negative forces and harness them to my chariot, then they can work to my advantage.","Film as dream, film as music. No art passes our conscience in the way film does, and goes directly to our feelings, deep down into the dark rooms of our souls.","For me, the human face is the most important subject of the cinema.","I have a feeling of complete balance. The sea, the house, the loneliness, the light. Everything is clearer. Much more precise. I have the feeling that I am living on a limit, and I'm crossing that limit sometimes.","The doors between the old man today and the child are still open, wide open. I can stroll through my grandmother's house and know exactly where the pictures are, the furniture was, how it looked, the voice, the smells. I can move from my bed at night today to my childhood in less than a second.","There is something joyous about not talking.","My pictures are always part of my thinking, and my emotions, tensions, dreams, desires.","I am very much aware of my own double self. The well-known one is very under control; everything is planned and very secure. The unknown one can be very unpleasant. I think this side is responsible for all the creative work - he is in touch with the child. He is not rational; he is impulsive and extremely emotional.","If I don't create, I don't exist.","The only thing I consider appalling would be to suddenly become a vegetable and a burden on other people. A soul slowly dying out, trapped in a body in which the insides gradually sabotage me - that, I think, would be terrifying.","From an early age onward, it was said that 'Ingmar has no sense of humor.'","I am forever living in my childhood.","Aging is not uncomplicated. Creativity is an extraordinary help against destructive demons.","Writing is boring, very boring, and it takes so much patience.","I write scripts to serve as skeletons awaiting the flesh and sinew of images.","I always work with 18 friends.","I am very shy with people I don't know.","Not a day has gone by in my life when I haven't thought about death.","When we came out from the Elysee palace, there was a gigantic limousine waiting for us and four police on motorcycles. It is probably one of the few times I have experienced my fame. I thought it was so fantastic that I laughed to the point of shouting.","There hasn't been anyone with whom I can discuss my scripts. Even when the film is done, there is no one I can show it to who gives his sincere opinion. There is silence.","I was very much in love with my mother. She was a very warm and a very cold woman. When she was warm, I tried to come close to her. But she could be very cold and rejecting.","When you finish a film, you never want to see it again.","We didn't know that Mother had gone through a passionate love affair or that Father suffered from severe depression. Mother was preparing to break out of her marriage, Father threatening to take his own life.","On a personal level, there are many people who have meant a great deal to me. My father and mother were certainly of vital importance, not only in themselves but because they created a world for me to revolt against.","I hope I never get so old I get religious.","Everything is worth precisely as much as a belch, the difference being that a belch is more satisfying.","I hate to travel. I don't go anywhere.","I am autobiographical in the way a dream transforms experience and emotions all the time.","I haven't put an ounce of effort into my families. I never have.","I usually say I left puberty at 58.","I had a bad conscience until I discovered that having a bad conscience about something so gravely serious as leaving your children is an affectation, a way of achieving a little suffering that can't for a moment be equal to the suffering you've caused.","Mother was actually a great doer and organizer. All the special occasions were directed by mother.","When I'm on Faro, I'm never lonely.","I don't watch my own films very often. I become so jittery and ready to cry... and miserable. I think it's awful.","I make all my decisions on intuition.","I dream about doing a film about once a week.","We always regret that we did not ask our parents more, really get to know them while they were alive.","The anger and the creativity are so closely intertwined with me, and there's plenty of anger left.","Now I want to make it plain that 'The Virgin Spring' must be regarded as an aberration. It's touristic, a lousy imitation of Kurosawa.","When you're as chaotic as I am, you need a very firm structure in your life.","I am extremely suspicious of dreams, apparitions and visions, both in literature and in films and plays. Perhaps it's because mental excesses of this sort smack too much of being 'arranged.'","I think that for some time now I have been living with an anxiety which has had no tangible cause. It has been like having a toothache, without the conscientious dentist having been able to find anything wrong with the tooth or with the person as a whole.","I have such difficulty calming down - my stomach, my head, reality, everything. That is the reason I live in Faro.","There are so many books I want to read. Difficult books. That's what I intend to do and what I'm longing for.","Sometimes, I probably do mourn the fact that I no longer make films.","In 'The Serpent's Egg,' I created a Berlin which no one recognized, not even I.","I have always appreciated the honest brutality of the international film world. One need never doubt one's worth in the market. Mine was zero.","I was booed at the premiere of 'Miss Julie,' a remarkably stimulating experience.","If I let myself go, nothing will get done.","My education was very tough.","Life wasn't about freeing up human souls. It was about creating obedient slaves in the hierarchical construction of the society - with God at the top, then the king and then the father.","I was bloody ill-tempered when I was young.","The smallest wound or pain of the ego is examined under a microscope as if it were of eternal importance. The artist considers his isolation, his subjectivity, his individualism almost holy.","People ask what are my intentions with my films - my aims. It is a difficult and dangerous question, and I usually give an evasive answer: I try to tell the truth about the human condition, the truth as I see it. This answer seems to satisfy everyone, but it is not quite correct.","When I was young, I was extremely scared of dying. But now I think it a very, very wise arrangement. It's like a light that is extinguished. Not very much to make a fuss about.","I am normally afraid of birds and have never dreamt of any bird in my life.","If I didn't have my profession, I think I would be sitting in a nuthouse. But I have been unceasingly at work, and this has been very healthy for me. So I had no need for therapy."],"Ingrid Bergman":["A kiss is a lovely trick designed by nature to stop speech when words become superfluous.","I was the shyest human ever invented, but I had a lion inside me that wouldn't shut up!","A kiss is a secret told to the mouth instead of the ear; kisses are the messengers of love and tenderness.","Be yourself. The world worships the original.","Happiness is good health and a bad memory.","I have no regrets. I wouldn't have lived my life the way I did if I was going to worry about what people were going to say.","I remember one day sitting at the pool and suddenly the tears were streaming down my cheeks. Why was I so unhappy? I had success. I had security. But it wasn't enough. I was exploding inside.","Time is shortening. But every day that I challenge this cancer and survive is a victory for me.","Until 45 I can play a woman in love. After 55 I can play grandmothers. But between those ten years, it is difficult for an actress.","Never again! I can see no reason for marriage - ever at all. I've had it. Three times is enough.","If you took acting away from me, I'd stop breathing.","I made so many films which were more important, but the only one people ever want to talk about is that one with Bogart.","Cancer victims who don't accept their fate, who don't learn to live with it, will only destroy what little time they have left.","I have grown up alone. I've taken care of myself. I worked, earned money and was independent at 18.","It is not whether you really cry. It's whether the audience thinks you are crying.","I don't think anyone has the right to intrude in your life, but they do. I would like people to separate the actress and the woman.","I can do everything with ease on the stage, whereas in real life I feel too big and clumsy. So I didn't choose acting. It chose me.","There are advantages to being a star though - you can always get a table in a full restaurant."],"Ingrid Betancourt":["I never say no to an ice cream.","Reconciliation is a decision that you take in your heart.","The relationship with time changes when you're captive.","Living in a jungle is not something easy; it's not something that you just adapt yourself to. And I think that in my case, I didn't want to adapt.","I continue with the illusion of serving Colombia. Only God knows if it were to be from the presidency.","In captivity, one loses every way of acting over little details which satisfy the essentials of life. Everything has to be asked for: permission to go to the toilet, permission to ask a guard something, permission to talk to another hostage - to brush your teeth, use toilet paper, everything is a negotiation.","In a kidnapping, you leave behind a lot of your baggage, like arrogance and stubbornness.","You need tremendous spirituality to stop yourself falling into the abyss.","Like in every peace process, and especially in Colombia, there all kinds of problems that will come through. Not only is the process by itself very complicated but it has lots of underground complications.","In the jungle, faith also became something very real; it helped me to understand what was happening to me and changed my questions.","I don't want to be submerged by depression.","I have to forget in order to find peace in my soul and be able to forgive.","During my captivity, I felt abandoned by everyone apart from my family and supporters, because there was no part of the political spectrum that would want me released.","I continue to aspire to serve Colombia as president.","I didn't want to be a number. I didn't want to be an object.","It's not easy to talk about things that are still hurting.","The only thing I've settled in my mind is that I want to forgive, and forgiveness comes with forgetting.","I love Colombia's military. I love my country.","When you have a chain around your neck, you have to keep your head down and try to accept your fate without succumbing entirely to humiliation, without forgetting who you are.","I carry the voices of all my family within me, and they were with me there in the jungle.","After six years without seeing one, I love just seeing a smile - every smile I see gives me hope.","More than a victim, I am a survivor of a dehumanization process.","France is my home; you are my family. I am carrying all of you in my heart.","I owe everything to France.","I have shed many tears of pain and indignation.","We have to be aware of our fragilities as human beings - when we see cruelty, to understand that in certain conditions, we could be cruel, too.","You don't master your fear. You're not able to say, 'I'm not going to be scared.' But what you can do is say, 'OK, I'm very very scared, but I have to do this and this and this.'","I want to tell President Sarkozy - and through him, all the French people - that they were our support, our light.","The voice of the Holy Father was like a light.","I want to serve my country, but not necessarily in the political arena.","I was in chains all the time, 24 hours a day, for three years. I tried to wear those chains with dignity, even if I felt that it was unbearable.","I know that I have to give testimony about all the things I lived, but I need time.","I was forbidden to talk to my fellow hostages.","I had this belief that I couldn't just accept to be treated as an object. It was a problem of dignity.","In the free world, your days pass very quickly because you have so many things to do, and you're in control of your life.","We can't continue with a justice of vengeance. Peace will require us to accept a certain degree of impunity; it's inevitable.","When you lose your freedom, you are alone with your emotions and reactions... you can see, for example, the bad reactions you have in front of others or the way you could be dismissive or harsh.","I am not irresponsible.","In the jungle, every day is like the other. So you need to have a special discipline to make things different and to keep in your memory the dates and the days. And I think that's something that's very important when you are held hostage.","I think that the worst thing is realizing that mankind - that - that human beings can be so horrible to other human beings.","You are a free woman, and then you become a prisoner, and you receive all kinds of orders. Sit here, stand there. That's it. You just, you don't have the possibility of even moving to take your bag without asking for permission.","I lived for nearly seven years with the awareness that death was my everyday companion.","I think that women are peacemakers by genetics, because we are the ones who stay at home and because we are the ones who suffer with the aftermath of war.","The thing is that war is the opposite of negotiation. It's when you cannot negotiate, when you cannot talk, when you cannot reach agreements that then you have war.","In Colombia, women are a huge factor for reconciliation. I have seen many strong women advocating for negotiations. I remember when the paramilitary were active, there were women close to the paramilitary asking for negotiations.","It's easy when you have suffered to feel the link with what others have gone through.","These years after my liberation were years of reconstruction, and I think I made the right decisions... I mean, I lost everything: my life; my father died; I didn't know anything about my children.","A novel - it's also a way of attacking subjects that you cannot confront in the eye.","Sometimes you need other people to embody situations so that you can talk about things that for you are important. And I think that being able to hope for the future is what builds in us the strength to just get rid of things that, in the past, can hurt.","As a Colombian, the only way I can relate to my country is through suffering. I hope that my children and my grandchildren will relate to the beautiful country in a way that it is positive and loving.","On one hand, it seems strange that a country that has suffered so much from violence and war would be debating if they want peace or not. But in Colombia, a part of society is deeply connected with the war as a means of making a living.","Forgiveness is a very personal and intimate thing. Forgiveness is not something that you can speak for others because it includes not only your desire and will, your reflection and intellect, but also your emotions.","I studied political science at the Ecole de Sciences Politiques in Paris.","I called my party the Green Oxygen party because Colombians were choking.","At first, I didn't want to accept that I had been abducted. I kept thinking, 'Next week, I'll be freed.'","I didn't want to accept that people would forget me, that the government wouldn't do anything to negotiate our freedom. After a year, I came to understand that not only had one year passed, many more would come.","We're humans. Why always turn human attitude into political behaviours? I hate that.","Reconciliation is a national decision that has to be debated and a consensus made among Colombians.","You only can rest when have the truth, even when it's horrible."],"Ingrid Newkirk":["Every animal has his or her story, his or her thoughts, daydreams, and interests. All feel joy and love, pain and fear, as we now know beyond any shadow of a doubt. All deserve that the human animal afford them the respect of being cared for with great consideration for those interests or left in peace.","The wonderful thing is that it's so incredibly easy to be kind.","Pigeons are gentle and smart and have complex social relationships. Their hearing and vision are both excellent.","Although we have, in theory, abolished human slavery, recognized women's rights, and stopped child labor, we continue to enslave other species who, if we simply pay attention, show quite clearly that they experience parental love, pain, and the desire for freedom, just as we do.","Pigeon racing is a lousy, greedy, and often unlawful activity. One thing that it is not is kind to birds.","Ninety-five percent of the eggs produced in America come from factory-farmed birds. Even if free-range farms were hugely more humane, the sheer number of animals raised to satisfy people's desire for eggs, meat, and milk makes it impossible for us to raise them all on small, free-range farms.","Animals aren't any better equipped to survive an emergency than humans are. Few people missed the fact that after Hurricane Katrina, people died because buses and emergency shelters wouldn't allow their animals.","Perhaps measuring animal intelligence by comparing it to human intelligence isn't the best litmus test.","If we are ever to halt climate change and conserve land, water and other resources, not to mention reduce animal suffering, we must celebrate Earth Day every day - at every meal.","When it comes to having a central nervous system, and the ability to feel pain, hunger, and thirst, a rat is a pig is a dog is a boy.","Pigeons are among the most maligned urban wildlife despite the fact that human beings brought them to our shores and turned them loose in our cities - not something that they chose.","Today, I marvel at the vegan foods in the supermarket, at the cruelty-free clothing choices in stores, and at the fantastic alternatives to dissection in schools, the modern ways to test medicines without killing rabbits and beagles, the many forms of entertainment involving purely human performers.","By adopting a wonderful mutt, you'll save a life and help reduce animal homelessness while also boosting your chances of a more robust new furry friend, as mixed-breed dogs have demonstrated better health and longer life spans than their purebred cousins.","I think if you're against cruelty and you look at what happens to animals in slaughterhouses and on factory farms, you have to be completely against eating meat.","Bulls can do nothing to demand justice. They can only defend themselves as best they can in a fight with a pre-determined ending and die never knowing why they were forced to endure such a painful and prolonged death. It's up to us, as a civilized society, to call for an end to the Running of the Bulls and bullfighting.","A lot of people have culturally induced ethical blindness, but they can be cured!","Whether or not we are religious, respecting others should be seen as just as important as looking out for ourselves, yet it requires discipline to change our bad habits that cause pain to animals.","It is only human supremacy, which is as unacceptable as racism and sexism, that makes us afraid of being more inclusive.","Real nutrition comes from soybeans, almonds, rice, and other healthy vegetable sources, not from a cow's udder.","We all have prejudices to dispel: the need to get away from thinking that 'I' am important and special and 'you' are not, and the frightened mindset that tells us that certain 'others' are of no consequence.","Fortified plant-based milks are delicious and contain all the calcium, protein, and vitamin D of dairy products but with none of the cholesterol, lactose, hormones, or cruelty found in cow's milk.","All tyranny, bigotry, aggression, and cruelty are wrong, and whenever we see it, we must never be silent.","Never doubt that one person can make a difference.","Cheap meat is the problem. The answer is to replace meat recipes with vegan meals.","Since we can't count on the meat, egg, and dairy industries to protect animals from the most egregious forms of cruelty, what can we, as consumers, do? Opting out of paying someone to allow animals to die in a barn fire or at the slaughterhouse seems pretty reasonable.","PETA's campaign should be included in school curricula. If we can open children's hearts and minds to animals' needs, teach them to treat a dog or a chicken as if they feel fear and love and pain - as they do - then they will grow up to understand that we are all worthy of respect.","Most Americans, like most Japanese, view their dogs, cats, and other animal companions as family members, and rightly so.","Animal hoarding was a dirty secret until hoarders appeared on our TV screens and showed how they are compelled to collect so many dogs, cats or parrots that the animals end up in cages only inches bigger than their own bodies. For life.","It's time to face facts: Most people stop being environmentalists when they sit down to eat.","To me, it is one world, and the non-human animals bear the brunt of oppression and suffering.","At PETA, we often say that the issue of how animals are treated isn't just about them; it's about us, how we behave.","One hates to be absolute, but in my view, there is no such thing as humane meat.","There's nothing humane about the flesh of animals who have had one or two or even three improvements made in their singularly rotten lives on today's factory farms.","Being asked to support humane meat means being asked to support the suffering of animals in transport, to approve of treatment that causes them palpable fear, their bodies shaking and their eyes wide as saucers, as they are slung by their legs into crates that are slammed onto the back of a truck.","All of us in society are supposed to believe that cruelty to animals is wrong and that it is a good thing to prevent needless suffering. So if that is true, how can meat be acceptable under any but the most extraordinary circumstances, such as perhaps roasting the bird who died flying into a window?","Why go for a costly, sickly, mass-produced purebred when shelters are full of one-of-a-kind mixed breeds who are literally dying for a home?","If you like to bake with eggs, you can substitute Ener-G egg replacer, bananas, tofu, or many other ingredients. You get the hang of it quickly enough.","It's interesting that one of the definitions of the word 'human' is 'sympathetic.' More and more people are beginning to show that they understand why that is important.","Consumers of meat, eggs and dairy products might well ask what they are supporting. Do farmers care about anyone but themselves? Can't anyone see the cow for the cheese?","Cows are gentle, interesting animals.","I hope SeaWorld is exploring how, like Ringling, it can get out of the wild animal business.","U.K. citizens fleeing the Middle East and Japan have been allowed to take their animal companions with them on evacuation flights. The U.S. is not so civilized, and that's a blot on our national copybook.","It's time for the State Department to permanently change its official policy to allow all members of U.S. citizens' families - no matter what size they are or how many legs they have - to evacuate together when disaster strikes.","Every time we consume meat, eggs or dairy foods, we contribute to ecological devastation and the wasteful misuse of resources on a global scale.","Going meat-free can make a huge difference. Studies show that vegetarians are, on average, 10 to 20 pounds lighter than meat-eaters and that a vegetarian diet reduces our risk of heart disease by 40 percent and adds seven or more years to our lifespan.","Elephants have the largest brains of any mammal on the face of the Earth. They are creative, altruistic and kind.","Give your dog or cat respect, patience, understanding and love. And if you just change to one vegetarian day a week, that's a wonderful step that will save animal lives. It means you have chosen something kind instead of something cruel.","It's the 21st century. It's healthier for us, better for the environment and certainly kinder to be a vegetarian.","Perhaps one of the most important things you can do for human beings is wean them off an animal-based diet. It hardens the arteries and runs up our health-care costs. The last thing a poor person can afford is a heart attack or cancer or a stroke. And that's all linked to a meat-based diet. I think animal liberation is human liberation.","I have to think of the positive; that's how I cope.","I don't have the luxury of having a dog myself because I travel too much, but I love walking and cuddling somebody else's dog."],"Ingrid Thulin":["We worked lightly even in the heaviest parts.","Why can't people credit that he and all of us had a sense of humour?"],"Ingvar Kamprad":["We don't need flashy cars, impressive titles, uniforms, or other status symbols. We rely on our strength and our will!","If there is such a thing as good leadership, it is to give a good example. I have to do so for all the Ikea employees.","How the hell can I ask people who work for me to travel cheaply if I travel in luxury? It's a question of good leadership.","I am very proud to follow the rules of our company.","Our idea is to serve everybody, including people with little money.","My theory was that good furniture could be priced so that the man with the flat wallet would be attracted to it, would make a place for it in his spending, and could afford it.","We have always looked at taxes as a cost, just as any other cost that comes with doing business.","I see my task as serving the majority of people. The question is, how do you find out what they want, how best to serve them? My answer is to stay close to ordinary people because, at heart, I am one of them.","People say I am cheap, and I don't mind if they do.","Everything we earn we need as a reserve.","Ikea people do not drive flashy cars or stay at luxury hotels.","We have to still develop the Ikea group. We need many billions of Swiss francs to take on China or Russia.","I'm not afraid of turning 80 and I have lots of things to do. I don't have time for dying.","I'm stingy and I'm proud of the reputation.","We ought to have more women in various management positions, because women are the ones who decide almost everything in the home.","Normally, I try to get my haircut when I'm in a developing country. Last time, it was in Vietnam.","I decided that the stock market was not an option for IKEA. I knew that only a long-term perspective could secure our growth plans, and I didn't want IKEA to become dependent on financial institutions.","If we want to be cost-conscious, we should do it, not just talk about how cost-conscious we are.","When the first million came in, I felt, 'My God, now I'm really independent.' That was a fantastic experience.","It is in the nature of Smaland to be thrifty.","The company will never go to the market. We want to keep strict self-financing.","An optimised tax structure gives us the possibility of flexibility in using our assets that have already been taxed in one market. They can be used in new markets for further business development without the additional burden of double taxation.","I've paid an awful lot of lawyers to protect what I've built. I can only hope the money was well spent.","I feel many responsibilities - to our customers, to our employees, to the environment, to the world at large. But I don't want to feel responsible to investors, to outsiders with financial concerns that may differ from those of the welfare of IKEA.","I look at the money I'm about to spend on myself and ask if IKEA's customers could afford it."],"Ioan Gruffudd":["As long as you understand that you find happiness through family, friends and love, then money is just a nice bonus.","To be honest, I think that I am a bit of a singer, coming from Wales; being Welsh, we are all very proud of our singing heritage.","People in America and Hollywood are very good at pronouncing my name, to begin with. Socially, they're very adept at listening to somebody's name and repeating it, cleverly in the first couple of sentences so the name sticks to begin with.","I'm determined not to lose my name. It's who I am. It has neither aided my progress nor hampered it. It's just who I am.","There's a physicality and confidence to Americans; they're very present. That's something I enjoy being around because it rubs off on you.","Being attractive, it's not something I do consciously. It's incredibly flattering that people think I appeal to women. But that was a gift from my parents.","You're always going to be more judgmental about your own performance than anyone else.","I love doing kids' films.","Actors, to a certain extent, never grow up, you see. It's an extension of being out in the back yard with a stick, only you're being paid to do it. It's borderline madness.","I know there are some actors who are just brilliant at improvising and brilliant at just being in the moment and doing it there and then. I'm not one of those actors.","It's interesting - an actor's research is different to just historian's research. I'm looking for things that I can actually physically use in the movie.","I could do an American accent, if I were immersed in the accent, meaning if I were living back in Los Angeles and rehearsing and auditioning the whole time.","I'm really enjoying living in Los Angeles. It's a great city to live in. I'm living a very suburban domesticated lifestyle out there - a two bedroomed little bungalow with two cars, and we're just driving around, going to meetings here and there - it's lovely!","I know I'm as comfortable doing period as I am contemporary. I suppose we grow up with it in a sense, in the theater. We get to put on costumes and play a lot of period dramas or plays so we're exposed to it a little bit more I think because of our theatrical background.","I've never been around pets. I didn't have pets as a child.","As an actor, I've always said, half the audience is going to love you, half is going to hate you so just live with it. It's easier that way.","I've been brought up with the Christian faith with my family.","And I guess I have a face and a look that sort of lends itself to period costume!"],"Ion Tiriac":["Some players get over-dependable on their coaches.","I eat leftover caviar by hand, with baked potato, like peasants.","I am not Shakespeare or Hemingway, but I have written stories on tennis that were brilliant.","I have a Lamborghini Diablo. I have Mercedes 600, a 500, a 300, a 190. I have a Ferrari Testarossa, a Porsche speedster.","I don't need to impress children.","I have 18 cars, but I never had a Rolls-Royce.","I have every single Ferrari that came out. I have all the Mercedes they came out with, all the Jaguars they came out with, all the Porsches they came out with.","Me writing about tennis is like a baker baking bread."],"Ione Skye":["I fell in love with doing yoga.","Chanting was very deep for me. It was as if I remembered it. It was like a real surrender.","I like doing a challenging class because it makes me more brave in life. My perception of hardships is now completely different. I'm not whining and moaning inside as much.","Yoga is a life-saver.","My mom has always been very open, very liberal. So I grew up with that, and I can appreciate everything that she did and went through and was exposed to.","There was a time when I was in this private school and the kids were so conservative and close-minded that it was just appalling.","Young people have so many letdowns that people don't realize.","It's just amazing that there are so many prejudices even now."],"Ippy Aiona":["Growing up, I was always in the kitchen. Even in third grade, I made cooking videos called 'The Little Italian.' Very little production value, but it was good.","I may look like a laid-back Hawaiian, but I'm 240 pounds, and when I'm walking around that kitchen, you don't want to get in my way."],"Iqbal Quadir":["Rich countries have been sending aid to poor countries for the last 60 years. And, by and large, this has failed.","Just as entrepreneurs developed America, they can develop other countries, too.","A lot of technologies in the world were unusual in the beginning, and became standard. That's the beauty of bottom-up entrepreneurship and innovations.","China has an almost infinite need for energy, and frankly, the world would be better off if much of that need goes in the direction of wind power.","In America, people buy cars, and they put very little money down. They get a car, and they go to work. The work pays them a salary; the salary allows them to pay for the car over time. The car pays for itself.","Barack Obama has talked a lot about changing the way America relates to the world, and few areas are as ripe for reform as our policies on foreign aid.","During the Cold War, the U.S. instituted a policy of sending money to governments in poor countries to buy their political loyalty. While studies show that sending aid to foreign governments creates allegiance, it does not lead to economic progress.","Pakistan is riddled with problems that are rooted in the disproportionate power of the state. Aid has only boosted that power.","We should encourage governments to be sustained by citizens' taxes - that is, democracies. Democracies will be enduring allies of America.","Poor countries are poor because they are wasting their resources.","I'm motivated by creating a level playing field for the world so that the weak have a chance.","The best way poor people can come out of their poverty is to get on the global highway, not on some dirt side road.","When leaders are no longer beholden to the people who elected them, corruption results and the recruitment of extremists becomes easier.","The history of Europe over the last several centuries provides clear evidence of the transformative power of commerce.","A military or government hierarchy is anathema to the dispersed population and diverse tribes of mountainous Afghanistan.","The rapid proliferation of cell phones in Afghanistan proves that anything that adds value to people's lives spreads like brushfire - and commerce is certainly a force that could add value for Afghanis."],"Ira Gershwin":["Deep, unspeakable suffering may well be called a baptism, a regeneration, the initiation into a new state.","Old age adds to the respect due to virtue, but it takes nothing from the contempt inspired by vice; it whitens only the hair.","A song without music is a lot like H2 without the O.","One can be very happy without demanding that others agree with them.","Life is one long jubilee.","Love is sweeping the country."],"Ira Glass":["I think people who live in New York don't realize just how much time they spend talking about the subway.","I hate dream sequences in movies and T.V. shows generally for their heavy-handed symbolism and storytelling tediousness.","The radio is good for taking somebody else's experience and making you understand what it would be like. Because when you don't see someone, but you hear them talking - and, uh, that is what radio is all about - it's like when someone is talking from the heart. Everything about it conspires to take you into somebody else's world.","In radio, you have two tools. Sound and silence.","The story is a machine for empathy. In contrast to logic or reason, a story is about emotion that gets staged over a sequence of dramatic moments, so you empathize with the characters without really thinking about it too much. It is a really powerful tool for imagining yourself in other people's situations.","There is a feeling, when you listen to radio, that it's one person, and they're talking to you, and you really feel their presence as one person.","One of the things I learned as a young semiotics nerd was that if you have plot moving forward, no matter how banal the facts of it, simply the fact that the plot is rolling forward makes you wonder what's going to happen next, which creates suspense. So you can control peoples' attention simply by having things move forward in a story.","I never realized before this the emotional power of some really simple, corny tropes: people with top hats, people with batons, confetti going off, how important it is to smile.","I can only control what I can control.","A lot of broadcasting, I think, is doing a tremendous amount of preparation and trying to act like, 'Oh, this thought is just occurring to me right now' - and speaking sincerely.","Traditional broadcast media seems old-fashioned and vague to me. When I watch television news, I'm aware of what skilled journalists they are, but I find it hard because of the corny way they present it.","Just when did I get to the point when staying at a hotel wasn't fun?","You'd think that radio was around long enough that someone would have coined a word for staring into space.","Any story hits you harder if the person delivering it doesn't sound like some news robot but in fact sounds like a real person having the reactions a real person would.","I don't go looking for stories with the idea of wrongness in my head, no. But the fact is, a lot of great stories hinge on people being wrong.","I'm not a go-in-for-the-kill kind of interviewer. It's a great thing to me, that kind of interviewer, but I'm not it. It doesn't play to my strengths at all. I like to interview people who are interested in telling their story and tell it as truthfully as they can.","Honestly, I find the analysis of dreams is one of the dullest things. I say this as a therapist kid. I find them deeply uninteresting, as a window to the soul.","When I was a bad writer, I would consciously imitate other NPR writers who I thought were wonderful. I suppose that everyone's artistic practice is different. But I collaborate and sometimes don't agree at all with my collaborators' opinions. It forces you to understand why you don't agree with something: what's the fight you're picking.","If you want somebody to tell you a story, one of the most easiest and effective ways is if you're telling them a story.","Semiotics is really interested in the questions like, what keeps you watching something, what keeps you - you know, what keeps you listening to a story on the radio? Like, what keeps you turning the pages in a book? What's the pleasure of it that's moving you forward, that's pulling you in and grabbing you and pulling you forward?","In most daily journalism, you only fact-check something if it seems a little fishy.","Where radio is different than fiction is that even mediocre fiction needs purpose, a driving question.","I suppose I shouldn't go around admitting I speak untruths on the radio.","It's not a terribly original thing to say, but I love Raymond Carver. For one thing, he's fun to read out loud.","But you can make good radio, interesting radio, great radio even, without an urgent question, a burning issue at stake.","In some theoretical way I know that a half-million people hear the show. But in a day-to-day way, there's not much evidence of it.","We're Jews, my family, and Jews break down into two distinct subcultures: book Jews and money Jews. We were money Jews.","But sadly, one of the problems with being on public radio is that people tend to think you're being sincere all the time.","I think good radio often uses the techniques of fiction: characters, scenes, a big urgent emotional question. And as in the best fiction, tone counts for a lot.","One reason I do the live shows - and the monthly speeches at public radio stations - is to remind myself that people hear the show, that it has an audience, that it exists in the world. It's so easy to forget that.","When I say something untrue on the air, I mean for it to be transparently untrue. I assume people know when I'm just saying something for effect. Or to be funny.","I am mostly a pretty worried person. In conversations, I am always worried about what to say.","I don't tweet because I don't need another creative venue. I don't need another form for self-expression. I don't need another way to get my thoughts out to people. I have one. I'm good.","I don't take care of my voice at all, which is one reason that I sound as bad as I do.","I don't own a radio. I listen to everything through apps or on my iPhone. And then I download the shows I like. Shows like 'Fresh Air', 'Radiolab', 'Snap Judgement', all those shows.","I feel like in an interview situation, it's a kind of intimacy that I can understand and handle - versus in real life, when I'm much more of a bumbler and have a hard time.","I just have a harder time, I think, feeling close to people without self consciousness.","I think one of the reasons that I got so good at it, as somebody making radio stories, is that on the radio I can actually - I can understand what's happening in the interview and can make a connection in a way that makes sense.","I think the name of the show, 'This American Life' - we named it that just because it seemed like it made the thing feel big. But we don't think about whether it's an American story or not. We happen to be Americans. I think for the stories to work, they have to be universal.","I have a pit bull. He's a rescue. He's adorable.","I have been shocked at the number of people who don't watch television.","I've actually done events at radio stations where I feel like I've had to give a little talk in behalf of television as a medium.","I didn't watch T.V. from the time I was 18 'til my mid-30s. And then I got a T.V. to watch 'The Sopranos.' I realized, 'Oh, T.V. is really interesting.'","It's rare for me to read any fiction. I almost only read nonfiction. I don't believe in guilty pleasures, I only believe in pleasures. People who call reading detective fiction or eating dessert a guilty pleasure make me want to puke.","Harry Potter to me is a bore. His talent arrives as a gift; he's chosen. Who can identify with that? But Hermione - she's working harder than anyone, she's half outsider, right? Half Muggle. She shouldn't be there at all. It's so unfair that Harry's the star of the books, given how hard she worked to get her powers.","I don't read novels, but my semiotics study influenced everything about the way I read and edit and write.","I'm in production year round. I work long hours. I have a dog and a wife. There's not a lot of available time for consuming any culture: T.V., movies, books. When I read, it's generally magazines, newspapers and web sites.","I'm not a natural storyteller at all. If anything, I'm a natural interviewer, a natural listener, but I'm not a natural storyteller.","When I was in college, I was a semiotics major, which is this hopelessly pretentious body of French literary theory.","I am such a do-goody, people-pleasing kid - or I was - I don't think I've ever been fired, not even from an ice cream shop, magician for kids' parties, not even in my early jobs in radio.","I read the newspaper, but I live in my own little bubble.","Honestly, like, I'm a superfan of the 'New York Times,' but I know nothing about how they put it together, and I really don't care.","I was a temp secretary for a long time, and I went at it with a passion, and I tried to do a nice job in all my jobs.","I eat the same breakfast and lunch every day, both at my desk. I employ no time-saving tricks at all.","I don't think I'm better than everyone else at anything, but I am very quick at organizing a big mass of interview tape into a structure.","When I started 'This American Life', one of the reactions I got was, 'When is the adult going to show up who will host the show?' At some point, people just got used to it.","I'll meet listeners who tell me what a great voice I have. But I don't have a great voice for radio. My voice is the utterly normal voice, but sheer repetition has made them think it's OK. Mick Jagger once was asked, 'What makes a hit song? He said, 'Repetition.'","In general in New York, we all eat like kings. Insane quality, mind-blowing variety, at all price ranges.","I like excess. And giant M&M's.","Not owning a car anymore, I feel like I'm barely an American. I miss it. And I barely ever get to listen to the radio in the car, which is the best place for radio.","I'm a cliche.","I didn't have any particular talent for fiction. I took a class in college.","I don't know how to read. I get all my news from Jon Stewart every day.","For me to do a story, something has to happen to someone. It's a story in the way you learn what a story is in third grade, where there is a person, and things happen to them, and then something big happens, and they realize something new.","I don't meet many people who are talking about shows on Showtime.","The Flash could do everything twice as fast. Except you never saw him think twice as fast or speak twice as fast. Could he do math faster than the other superheroes? Could he compute the tip for the bill twice as fast?","'Smallville' is like a Domino's pizza. While you're eating, you're thinking, 'This is good, and it reminds me of pizza, but there's not enough flavor in each bite.' That's the feeling you have the entire time with 'Smallville' - that it's just about to be good, but it never is.","I was a semiotics major at Brown, and there's this idea that stories are better, books are better, and movies are better if they cocked you off your axis and you were completely disoriented and you'd really have to rethink everything. Nobody has that experience, actually.","The TiVo is really an amazing machine. Like everyone who has one, I totally recommend it. Just as everyone who's married will tell you to get married, and everyone who has a baby tells you to have a baby, everyone who owns a TiVo will tell you to get a TiVo, and they'll say things like 'Your life will be completely different.' It's true.","Writing is just very difficult. I'm an adequate performer. And I think I have a special talent as an editor. Editing is what I do best.","I liked the people at Brown, while I really disliked most of the fellow students I had met at Northwestern.","Radio is more powerful the closer we mimic the way we actually speak to each other. That's why Howard Stern is such a great radio talent. People on his show are actually speaking to each other. You might not like what they're saying, but they're real conversations.","It's tricky, performing the show live. Because when you're in a big auditorium, in front of 700 people, the natural tendency is to want to talk louder. You want to project.","I think good radio often uses the techniques of fiction: characters, scenes, a big urgent emotional question. And as in the best fiction, tone counts for a lot. But a lot of effective and interesting radio is based on one character who reacts to the world.","I suppose I shouldn't go around admitting I speak untruths on the radio. When I say something untrue on the air, I mean for it to be transparently untrue. I assume people know when I'm just saying something for effect. Or to be funny.","Radio is for driving.","I love traveling. But I haven't had big, transformative experiences while on the road. When I go out on the road, it's to go out and get a story or do a promotional event.","I was a freelancer all through my 20s and was very slow to get good at what I did.","I only got interested in radio once I talked my way into an internship at NPR's headquarters in Washington, D.C. in 1978, never having heard the network on the air.","The atheist market is a very overlooked and powerful market, it turns out.","My first job on the radio was writing jokes for a Baltimore DJ called Johnny Walker, who was sort of a '70s era shock jock who all the teenage boys listened to in my school.","I'm a reporter - if I don't interview someone, I don't have much to say, and I definitely can't just sit down and knock out 800 words on any subject you give me.","The pledge drive has everything going against it as broadcasting. It's repetitive. It's ad-libbed by people who can't ad-lib. It's about asking for money, which is something nobody wants to hear, even from their own relatives.","There is a kind of structure for a story that was peculiarly compelling for the radio. I thought I had invented it atom-by-atom sitting in an editing booth in Washington on M Street when I was in my 20s. Then I found out that it is one of the oldest forms of telling a story - it was the structure of a sermon.","Reporters tend to find in others what they are suited to find, so there is a whole school of reporting where they are cynical about the world, and everything reinforces that. Whereas I tend to be optimistic and be amused by people and like them, even rather bad people.","People are generally forced to change. We don't want to change, and then something absolutely forces us to realize that what we are doing isn't working or that our picture of the world is wrong. We fail. So we change.","Like, radio is closer to a Tumblr, or a blog, or Twitter, than it is to television, I think.","The flakier your mission, the fiercer you have to be on the business side.","I'm trying to make perfect moments. And those generate meaning. If you go deep enough in how to make a moment, very quickly you come to how narrative works - to what we are as a species, how we've come up with telling stories in scenes and images.","Unless you work for '60 Minutes', your life is: You do stories about things, and nothing happens as a result.","I feel like, in general in my work life, my main goal has been to just be in a situation where I'm not bored with my job. That's been the entire principle. Got my wish.","When you're working in public radio, you don't have any money to advertise.","At some point, all comics have to go out and be retail salesmen doing door-to-door. And this idea of somebody who totally knows their craft having to get up for free in front of a crowd to work out some stuff they're thinking in their head, still, after as much success as you can get, is really interesting.","I'm a big Penn & Teller fan. But I myself was never very good; I was a teenage magician who performed at kids' parties. I can still perform a vanish, credibly, and I still, in special circumstances, will make a balloon animal.","Like most people in radio - and in magic - I'm not cool. I know people who are hip, and I can feel distance between them and me.","I remember that in Baltimore, where I grew up, we would drive by the radio station and tower of WBAL, and I would try to picture the people inside and what they did there.","I'm just not very funny.","I started out doing production work on promos, stuff like that. I didn't think it was cool to be working for NPR. I didn't need anything to be cool. I just wanted something to do that would be interesting. It was fun. I didn't think of it as anything else but fun.","It took, for me, a long time to develop this idea of what to do on the radio. But from the beginning of my time in radio, I had pretty non-traditional tasks.","I think stories get better the more people try to amuse themselves.","I wish somebody had given me the news that ideas don't just fall on your head like fairy dust. You have to treat that like a job. You have to spend hours each day, where you're just like, 'This is the part of the day when I'm looking for an idea.'","I've read the poker books, but at this point, everybody who's playing has read the poker books. I feel like I'm knowledgeable enough to understand what's going on in the game, and I understand why I suck. And I'm not sure if I'll ever rise beyond that to the level where I don't suck.","Honestly, I am so ignorant of how dance works that I can't even imagine a story that you would want to tell through movement.","Any story that I can consider worth telling is one that you could tell in words.","You get into this situation, performing for T.V., where you have to speak with utter sincerity. It's just like the radio. You have to say it like you mean it, even though the thing you're saying is actually planned out.","I've never so appreciated what actors do and how strange it is.","I feel like dance, by its nature, goes so easily to grand and beautiful.","When you're learning, especially to write, unless you're some incredibly gifted writer, a young Malcom Gladwell, say, you need to be imitating people. You need to be imitating how they make their work, how they structure it, how they design the pieces. It gives you chops; it gives you moves.","Honestly, there are so many things about structuring a story for film and telling a story for film that are really different from doing radio.","Generally the aesthetics of broadcast journalism seem to me to be incredibly primitive.","Starting in the 1970s, American cars started to lose market share to foreign cars. It was clear what was happening - these better-made foreign car companies were encroaching on the U.S., and the U.S. car makers had less than half of their own country's market.","If you date one woman a year, times 10 years, and that's 10 women.","Grease and starch just always win over protein. In food as in so many things. Look around you, that's what our whole country is based on. It's amazing that Michael Jordan can be an iconic figure because he's basically just protein."],"Ira Glasser":["You will be pleased to know I stand obediently for the national anthem, though of course I would defend your right to remain seated should you so decide.","The notion of religious liberty is that you cannot be forced to participate in a religious ceremony that's not of your choosing simply because you're out-voted."],"Ira Hayes":["I am not a hero but the brave men who died deserved this honor.","The real heroes were my good buddies who died during the battles.","No one ever complains about a speech being too short!","I was sick. I guess I was about to crack up thinking about all my good buddies. They were better men than me and they're not coming back. Much less back to the White House, like me."],"Ira Levin":["Before that I wanted to be a magazine illustrator - I probably would have painted Gothic scenes.","I finally did work out a very good relationship with my father, but it was rough growing up. We had a lot of conflict, and I think it surfaced in many of my works.","I didn't send back any of the royalty checks."],"Ira Sachs":["There's a lot of things lost in the Digital Age.","Fighting bitterness can be a full-time job.","My father moved out to Park City in in the mid-'70s and lived in a Winnebago behind a hippie joint called Utah Coal & Lumber that was one of only two or three restaurants at that time. Park City was a sleepy little mining town, with not a condo in sight.","You can only begin to share life well when you think well of yourself.","Seeing the road show of 'A Chorus Line' in 1977 at the Orpheum Theater in downtown Memphis was a life-changing event for me: there were gay people, on the stage, and they all lived in New York.","One of the biggest things that happens to many people when they have kids is that you suddenly realize that you're not going to last forever. You know there is another generation who are the heroes of their own stories, and that is humbling.","New York grabbed me too hard, as did adulthood.","Most simply but profoundly, I chose to live an honest life, which I think as a gay person is not a given.","All of my films have been autobiographical - it's all I've got to go on.","What's interesting to me is the distinction between my old life and my present life.","Capturing intimacy is pretty much the only thing I'm interested in. That's what excites me and what I find beautiful in movies personally - that almost obscene sense that we shouldn't be this close to these people. I find that very inviting and meaningful as an audience member.","I've been hiding crucial events in my life since I was 13.","I'm not interested in a film about deceit anymore. I think I was always invested in deceit on some level. But it no longer compels me the way it did for so many years.","I always think of my films within the context of where aesthetics meet economics. That's the nature of making art - not being naive about what is possible and getting what you need to tell the story you want to tell.","For me, every film is actually a form of documentary.","I've always been interested in how the individual comes to know and accept him or herself, which I think has been hard for me.","As a gay person, my life has been marginalized.","Everything encourages you not to tell stories of gay lives. There is no economy yet for that kind of cinema.","As independent filmmakers, we are actually deeply dependent on each other. The Spirit Awards are a public expression of those bonds, the intricate set of relationships and histories that we filmmakers depend on to make our most personal work.","I got into filmmaking in order to tell very personal stories, and in this day and age, the opportunity seems all the more precious.","Without community events like NewFest, I don't think we'd have a queer cinema in America.","My films might have been queer - because I was - but they were not gay.","Being an artist is in part an act of rupture.","I could not - and I still cannot - see a sustainable career as a filmmaker in which I focus fully on our gay stories.","I came to N.Y.C. in 1988 and got very involved with Act Up. I also started making movies, including two very gay shorts, 'Vaudeville' and 'Lady.' It was the height of the AIDS epidemic, and New York City was both dying and very alive at the same time.","I grew up in the 1960s in Memphis, and my father was a member of the American Civil Liberties Union. I was born three years before Martin Luther King was killed, and I think that history of civil action was something that I had in my blood.","Music Box has proven itself in a few short years to be a cutting edge distributor with a sophisticated understanding of both the market and cinema.","Intimacy is something to be cherished, and intimacy is not something to be afraid of.","I grew up thinking there was something called 'independent film,' which I wouldn't necessarily have had access to if there wasn't Sundance.","For gay people, we learned about our lives in secrecy and a lot of fear.","I think it's interesting: What is the generational effect of the experience of being a gay person in America? For my generation, it was very difficult.","It's easy to make a film, but it's hard to make a career of being a filmmaker.","I realize I have strength as an artist and professional by embracing my difference instead of what makes me the same.","Everyone wants to belong, and everyone needs to belong in order to make a career on some level.","By 15, I was lucky enough to find the theater.","By 1988, I was living in New York myself.","'How to Survive a Plague' is history-telling at its best. It's a film I'll show my two children, now toddlers, when they are old enough to understand. It's a movie that I cannot forget.","You can understand why good publicists go on to run distribution companies: because the creativity involved is complex and nuanced.","I find the stuff that is exciting to me are the films coming out of Taiwan and Iran and France. So I have the feeling I'm not making the films that American distributors want to make.","I've been close to two or three couples, gay and straight, who have been together for 45 years.","Every film is hard to fund.","You can be aware of the passing of time without being nostalgic.","All history is defined by shifting modes of reality and time and how things change. That's what I love about cinema. It changes in the moment.","I like a film that makes the audience feel like they are in the middle of life as it is moving, and in a way, they are catching up. They are thrown into things.","I have been very influenced by the director Maurice Pialat, who I continue to be in conversation and conflict with and get inspiration from.","I think there's a fear of difference in American cinema.","A lot of what I think I do as a director is try to give everything over to the actor. So I disappear.","I don't think I'd ever start making a film until I had both the intimacy with the subject and the distance to make it live in a certain way.","What I loved about 'Goodfellas' is that it's a film about bad behavior - but told with great energy and without judgment - but it doesn't actually shy away from the consequences of that behavior in the characters' lives, which I think is similar in 'Keep the Lights On.'","As a filmmaker, you realize that places have character based on their history as much as a face does or an actor does.","I've made four films about the destructive nature of relationships, of secrets and lies, and I think I'm no longer interested in that subject - which is a wonderful relief.","I don't rehearse with my actors... the first rehearsal is the first time we turn the camera on... Sydney Pollack never rehearsed his actors, and I found out that's allowed... so you film reactions; you don't create them.","Why do people stay in relationships that are tough from almost the very beginning?","I started making movies in the early '90s, a few years after I discovered 'the cinema' during a three month stay in Paris during which I watched 100s of films.","Secrets make for good drama, and revealing the hidden truths and contradictions of life is, for me, one of the most exciting aspects of making movies.","I always hope that people feel less alone when they see a movie that I make. That some part of the story played out on the big screen will resonate for individuals in the audience in a way that gives them comfort.","Every time you make a film, you create a world. You make decisions about sets and costumes, and you create a universe connected to reality, but not reality itself.","Suspense films are often based on communication problems, and that affects all of the plot points. It almost gives it kind of a fable feeling.","Movies are romantic fantasies.","As I've gotten less righteous, less pedagogic, I have become more loving of the artificiality, the art form, the imitation of life in film.","I remember being a teenager and seeing Seymour Cassel across a crowded room and being incredibly star struck, and not having the courage to say, 'Hello.'","I conveniently was not accepted to film school, which I applied to in 1987, and so I decided I would become a filmmaker instead of a student."],"Ireland Baldwin":["I love walks, hiking, exploring and being on the beach.","I went through a lot in middle school, and you always try so many different looks and try to be so many different people. I finally realized I'm awkward, I'm lanky, and I'm going to embrace it - make fun of myself and just laugh.","I imagine how hard it might be to walk down the runway. Me in heels is, like, deforesting the forest, knocking trees, completely 'timber!'","Life's too short not to have fun with what you wear.","There are Katy-Perry-in-concert-type pieces that I look at and am like, 'This dress has a hundred cupcakes on it - I want it!' My mom will always talk me down.","When I was young, I'd fight everyone who insisted I'd be an actress. I'd say, 'No way. I'm going to be a veterinarian. I'm going to work at Wetzel's Pretzels.'","I've learned to treat celebrities as equals and just kind of meet them and admire their work, but I definitely could not breathe when I met Johnny Depp and James Franco.","I want to be an inspirational model. I want people to look at me and say, 'Wow, she looks healthy.'","I have received nasty e-mails, messages on Twitter and ridiculous comments, not only about my size, but my family.","Even when I get to the point where I am acting and performing, where I want to be with my career, I'm never going to think of anyone as lower than me. Everyone's the celebrity of their own life, you know?"],"Irena Sendler":["People can be only divided into good or bad; their race, religion, nationality don't matter.","Every child saved with my help and the help of all the wonderful secret messengers, who today are no longer living, is the justification of my existence on this earth, and not a title to glory.","The term 'hero' irritates me greatly."],"Irene Dunne":["You see I found I didn't have to act to be happy.","Years ago the public used to hound me but now I can go shopping in peace.","So being two different people in one day unnerved me to no end.","I'll leave the swearing to the Jane Fondas.","I always believed in my characters. I lived them.","But friends invited me to a private screening of Emmanuelle and said I'd learn a few things. But I know all the swear words. I just don't use them. So I declined.","And yet I think The White Cliffs of Dover one of my best films.","A woman needs a man like a fish needs a bicycle."],"Irene Joliot-Curie":["Each emission of an alpha or beta ray accompanies the transmutation of an atom; the energy communicated to these rays comes from inside the atom.","The time necessary for the disappearance of half the atoms, called the half-life, is a fundamental characteristic of each radio-element; according to the substance, the value of the half-life varies between a fraction of a second and millions of years.","It was at the beginning of 1934 while working on the emission of these positive electrons that we noticed a fundamental difference between that transmutation and all the others so far produced; all the reactions of nuclear chemistry induced were instantaneous phenomena, explosions.","We have shown that it is possible to create a radioactivity characterized by the emission of positive or negative electrons in boron and magnesium by bombardment with alpha rays."],"Irene Peter":["Just because everything is different doesn't mean anything has changed.","Today, if you are not confused, you are not thinking clearly.","Anyone who thinks there's safety in numbers hasn't looked at the stock market pages.","Always be sincere, even when you don't mean it.","Ignorance is no excuse, it's the real thing.","To make crime unprofitable, let the government run it."],"Irene Rosenfeld":["The most important role of a leader is to set a clear direction, be transparent about how to get there and to stay the course.","It's fair to characterise me as competitive and determined, but anyone who works with me will attest to the fact I believe very strongly in the notion of servant leadership.","Parenting is one of the best management training programs there is.","I talk a lot about taking risks, and then I follow that up very quickly by saying, 'Take prudent risks.'","Mom was a housewife; Dad was an accountant. They taught me a lot about the value of working hard.","Major organizational changes create uncertainty.","Our emerging workforce is not interested in command-and-control leadership. They don't want to do things because I said so; they want to do things because they want to do them.","I truly believe that the combination of a strong top line together with a strong bottom line is what makes for a sustainable business.","Major organizational changes create uncertainty. But the point is to move quickly - faster than you are comfortable - because in hindsight, you will always wish you had made changes even sooner.","I've received many good pieces of advice throughout my life.","I am very excited and delighted to be an important part of the development of corporate America.","Sports have always been a really important part of how I energize myself, as well as how I relax. I spend a lot of my spare time with my family playing tennis, biking and rollerblading.","Do what in your heart you know is right. It is easy to get caught up in your ambitions, but no job is worth not being true to yourself.","People need to know that what they're doing is making a difference and that their leaders notice and appreciate their efforts.","I think my father was somewhat disappointed in not having had a son, and in that way I was the nearest thing he had.","Exposure to a diversity of disciplines has been exceptionally helpful to me.","Even in developing markets, we're seeing the growth of digital communication is proceeding at a very rapid pace.","There's no question that consumers are looking for value today.","I think all of us are multitasking a little more today than we used to or than we would like to. And I think that the issue of work-life balance is a critical issue for every company around the world.","I believe very strongly in the value of having a diverse team around me that comes from very different backgrounds and different points of view.","I've always challenged myself and the people who work with me to take new approaches to traditional business challenges, to push the envelope and constantly ask whether our sacred cows are still producing great milk.","You can't play it safe if you want to get ahead.","I hate to see people frustrated or leave a company for an opportunity they could easily have had at their current company if they had only asked.","When investors, particularly investment bankers, talk about splitting up companies, there's a lot of discussion about multiple expansion, and the reality is multiple expansion is an outcome, not a strategy.","People vote with their hearts, not their heads.","During a transformation, it's understandable to be hesitant about moving too fast, especially at the outset.","How you manage change can make all the difference.","Endorphins are a very powerful thing.","I think my very best piece of advice is be yourself.","I grew up in business at a time where there weren't very many female role models, and so in the early days, we wore little bow ties like the guys, and we talked about the Army even though we weren't in the Army. And the reality was that wasn't the right way to approach the business world.","I've done more travel than I need to in my lifetime.","Leaders tend to focus on 'what to do,' but the real issue is more often 'how to do it.'"],"Irina Shayk":["Nothing is better than going home to family and eating good food and relaxing.","What I've never understood is why some women use plastic surgery to make themselves more attractive to men. The most beautiful woman is someone who's happy and is always smiling.","I believe in eating what I like and sweating it out in the gym.","I'm always sad to leave paradise, but I leave behind the hopes of coming again soon.","When it comes to lingerie, there are no rules. I feel the sexiest when I'm myself, no hair, no makeup.","All women have insecurities and bad times. What counts is how you overcome them.","Mutual respect is very important in a relationship, and since my work is part of my life, he would have to respect it.","Sometimes I wake up and think I look horrible. And sometimes I see a strong woman.","I think whatever dress you wear, people will criticise you. Different people have different opinions.","I love high heels from the age of 10! Short skirts and then high heels. My classmates used to make fun of me. Like, 'Ooh, she's so skinny and she's wearing high heels.' But I just wore what I like, and I didn't care about people's opinions, the same as I don't care now.","Nothing is easy, and as far as my modelling career goes, the path to the top has been long and difficult, but that's what makes it special. I always look back to remind myself where I've come from.","I love traveling. I hate jet lag, but I love, love, love, love traveling, to meet new people, to try different foods because I'm a big foodie.","I started playing piano age six. I was also singing in the choir, so my mum put me into music school. I went to study there for seven years, but it was not my passion. I quit because I wanted to study marketing. But I can still play piano.","My father used to be a fisherman, so it always makes me feel close to him when I am there on the water catching my dinner.","A lot of people think that to make it as a model you just need to be pretty and slim, but they're wrong. There's a lot of hard work involved. You have to be very focused, know what kind of work you're aiming for.","My ideal man is faithful, honest, and a gentleman who knows how to treat women.","I travel around the world, and there are so many beautiful girls, but that's not going to make you a supermodel. You have to have something more than just a pretty face.","I spend time doing cardio because it makes me feel good.","If you're with someone, it's because you're moving in the same direction, and you both are looking for the same thing. Both of you have to share the same concept of what a relationship means.","Use coconut oil; it is one of the best moisturizers. Use it right after the shower on wet skin and then wipe it off with a towel.","When I grew up, my role model was my grandma because she's just the best.","I think success is very hard work, so, you know, if you work hard and you have some success, you have to give up something.","The only art I have is a Polaroid from Peter Beard from his book. I shot with him four years ago, and he did a special Polaroid for me, so I consider it a piece of art.","I'm Russian: I'm into men, diamonds, and caviar.","In Russia, we eat a lot of heavy food like potatoes and lots of meat. I can't eat one apple or a salad a day. You wouldn't want to come talk to me if I don't eat. I have to eat, or I am in a really bad mood.","Don't forget to eat a lot of greens and fish oil pills. Those are two of the best things to keep your skin glowing.","If you want to eat chocolate or cakes, you have to eat it in the morning, for breakfast or lunch - don't eat it in the night.","I always had a short bob with bangs, and I hated it. My mum would always say, 'A short hair cut is always the way to go for you.' I had it for fourteen years!","While I can always use a break from the gym, I like to swim and dive to keep myself feeling good.","Both should share the same concept of what a relationship means and the same energy to believe in a monogamous relationship.","In the morning, I always use a cube of ice on my face - it gives me a natural lift.","I believe women should be independent and have their own life. But I also think that when a couple decides to have a family, things change because you need to live in unison.","When I was growing up in Russia, my grandmothers would cook the best pancakes in the world, the best meatballs, the best dumplings.","I love fast food, but you have to try to eat healthy.","I hate morning workout; I'm a night person more. But it's good to work out in the mornings because then you can have all day free.","Money is not important to me. What makes me feel successful is making the people I love happy.","My favorite spot is the Maldives. Since I travel so much for work, I like to go to places that are very secluded and quiet.","I'm very smart, and I have a great team of people around me investing my money. I'm not buying gold - yet.","I started my career as a swimsuit model. My first big break in America was 2007, 'Sports Illustrated' Swimsuit Issue.","For my body, I like high-waisted jeans because they make your leg look longer and hides this extra thing on my stomach. You can eat extra food with it because it hides, and I like to tuck in my t-shirts.","Of course I prefer to be with someone, but with the right someone.","It's very simple. You have to be faithful to your other half and not have secrets. That's my rule.","I don't believe in men who make us feel unhappy, because they're boys, not men.","I'm not a fan of soccer, for sure not.","I was noticed by a person from a local model agency, and he proposed that I participate in a beauty contest Miss Chelyabinsk.","I never thought of a career of as a model, and it was a total surprise for me when I won the contest and became Miss Chelyabinsk. Then I started modelling in Paris.","My father was dark skinned because he was Tatar. Sometimes Tatars can look Brazilian.","I get my light eyes from my mother.","After school, my sister and I helped our mom in the garden. We grew potatoes, cucumbers, tomatoes - not for fun, but to eat.","Actually, I wanted to become a journalist, but no matter who I imagined myself to be in the future, somehow I was sure: I would leave my hometown. I felt it was my destiny.","I think a woman feels ugly when she's got the wrong man at her side.","I've felt ugly and insecure.","I was born and raised in a small village, and I didn't even think I was especially pretty.","At 14, I'd have given my left arm to be a boy: I thought I was horrible and that no-one would ever find me attractive.","Relationships are hard, so you have to know what type of man you want by your side and what their values are, what is important in his life.","I love honest men, and a I love a man who is loyal to women.","I am trying to concentrate on books. You know, I love Dostoevsky; he's my favourite writer.","I feel like woman was brought to this world to have family and kids.","I don't know how many kids I am going to have, but definitely I am one of those women who wants to have family and kids.","I would love to play a crazy Russian spy, run with a gun. That's something I would love to do.","Stay away from the sun and remember the skin on a woman's neck, hands and face is sensitive and ages easily, so apply a high SPF sunscreen on those areas.","Of course I want to have a family, but there's a right time for everything. When my time comes, it will happen.","I'm really grateful to my fans - to all the people who support me.","I would never do 'Playboy.'","Yes, I am a lingerie model, but I have class.","I think of myself as a cover girl. But I would never do some kind of cheesy magazine.","I'm in hotel rooms most of the time, and it can be hard to find a hotel with a nice gym. It was important for me to have a workout I could do in my room.","I'm a model, but I love to eat.","Sometimes when I'm on set, I keep eating, and people are like, 'You really eat that?' I'm like, 'Yes, I do.'","I do boxing; I do a little jiu jitsu, which I am obsessed with.","Try not to eat after 7 P.M. Try to stay away from heavy food in the night, like hamburgers and chicken nuggets. Eat that stuff in the morning or early afternoon.","If you are in a relationship, it has to be a good one. If it isn't, it's best to just leave it.","It doesn't matter if you're small, big, or fit: if you go in front of the camera and deliver and say, 'Oh my God, I look amazing,' and just be sure about yourself, everything will be perfect.","To be half-naked for a Greek mythology movie, it's a piece of art. You know, there's nothing vulgar in there.","I'm a woman who is very confident with the body, with my body.","Even if you have some extra kilos, you don't need to kill yourself for that; you just have to look at yourself as a positive.","I started modelling quite late, at 20. In this industry, girls start when they're barely even 14 or 15.","Of course, nothing just falls into your lap - to get where I am now, I've worked hard.","I don't care what people think about me. I really don't.","In my business, you should be very strong in mind. You have to be sure about yourself and about your work and your career, and you have to be strong inside because so many people come around and try to say bad things about you.","I hate wearing makeup because I am just too lazy to take it off at night.","I am really bad with cleaning my closet.","I don't spend a lot of money on clothes, which is weird because I am a fashion model, but when it comes to the new collections coming out, I am just praying designers send it to me for free.","Boys never liked me at school. They made fun of me 'cos I had dark skin.","You can't break Russian people, you know? 'Cos we're made in cold snow. We're very resistant.","You have to invest the money in a certain thing, because, you know, at 40, I want to enjoy my life. So I do a lot of investments. Apartments back in Russia and New York. It's a good thing to do.","This is my favorite area in New York - the West Village is the heart of New York. I could never move somewhere else.","You can't wear only one dress and be so safe. You have to risk; that's how you learn about yourself.","We will all be gone one day. Not as a negative thing - as a positive thing, too, you know, and we should leave something behind ourselves.","I love Japan; it's very special.","Just for you to know, people, models, are very smart. We're investing money in the right way, and, you know, a modeling job I'm taking as a businesswoman. So it's not fun for me; it's work.","I'm just collecting gold presents, which is more fun, actually, than buying gold.","My mom, she's a great cook. You know, pirogue, borscht. I love borscht, and I love Pilemeni, meat dumplings.","I don't cook. I love to eat. I love to go to the restaurants.","You have to love your body, respect it, and treat it well.","The 'Hercules' role just kind of came to me, but I had a lot of fun trying something new.","I really love to play 'Moonlight Sonata' by Beethoven. I can still read music, but I need to practise more. The way your fingers move - it's something that comes from memory. I love music.","I couldn't speak any English when I first left Russia, and Intimissimi taught me everything. The team was like a family to me - they showed me how to model and how to stay in shape. They really believed in me.","My father died when I was 14, and my mother juggled two jobs so she could make sure my sister and I were OK.","You can't just dream about what you want and leave things to chance. You have to get it yourself.","My personal memories of the brand go way back to the time when I was a teenager. L'Oreal make-up felt like a real luxury for me, and I remember dreaming of purchasing a L'Oreal lipstick.","To me, being worth it means being independent and carving your own path. The L'Oreal woman is worth it because she wants to be.","When I was a teenager, I experimented a lot with hair colour, and the result was just awful.","Every year is beautiful, and I try to appreciate each moment in my career, but 30 was definitely one of my best.","You can see designers and fashion people bringing in older girls to do their shows - I'm not even afraid to say 'older.'","I think family is our reason for being. I was lucky to be born into a very close-knit family.","I would definitely like to start a family because it's the most important thing in the world and what you should take care of, along with your friends and the people you love.","I don't think there's a perfect time to have kids. I think first you have to find the perfect person.","I love seeing lingerie on the runway, but I personally think it's best to save it for the bedroom!","I'm from a very small village in the middle of nowhere, four hours by airplane from Moscow. Yemanzhelinsk - you wouldn't find it on the map. Don't even try it. It's super, super tiny.","I hadn't planned to be a model. It just happened by pure chance. I went to a beauty school with my sister, and I got discovered pretty late. I was discovered when I was 20-21.","I hate jet lag, but I love, love, love, love traveling - to meet new people, to try different foods because I'm a big foodie. I love food, even though people think models don't eat. We do eat.","I hate cardio; I hate to go for a run. I hate physical things. But Jiu Jitsu is fun because its self-defence and you get some good cardio.","I love food - I am never on a diet - I swear to God!"],"Iris Apfel":["Great personal style is an extreme curiosity about yourself.","My father told me once not to expect anything from anybody so I wouldn't be disappointed. If somebody was nice and did nice things for me, I should be overjoyed, but I shouldn't go through life expecting it, which is very good advice.","I'm a hopeless romantic. I buy things because I fall in love with them. I never buy anything just because it's valuable.","When you don't dress like everybody else, you don't have to think like everybody else.","Oh my God, I'm a walking advertisement for discounted shopping.","The world is not black and white; there are lots of shades of grey. There are good things and bad things in every era, and I think it's kind of very blindfolded to say one era was wonderful, as it was wonderful, but there were a lot of bad things as well.","I don't expect to find inspiration. It just sort of comes. Sometimes you step on a bug and you get inspired.","If you don't learn constantly, you don't grow, and you will wither. Too many people wither on the vine. Sure, it gets a little harder as you get older, but new experiences and new challenges keep it fresh.","You can change the look of an outfit so easily by changing the kind of jewellery you wear. If you have a basic outfit on - a black sweater and skirt or a simple black dress - you can go from the office to a cocktail party at night just by changing your jewellery. It helps if you change your shoes as well.","You have to push yourself when you're older because it's very easy to fall into the trap. You start to fall apart - you just have to do your best to paste yourself together. I think doing things and being active is very important. When your mind is busy, you don't hurt so much.","Aging gracefully is about no heavy makeup, and not too much powder because it gets into the wrinkles, and, you know, to not get turtle eyelids and to not try to look young.","I am not a fashionista, and I don't dress up. Usually if I'm at home, where I am now, I'm wearing a robe.","You learn as you grow up, if you're intelligent - or even three-quarter witted - that there's no free lunch. You pay for things in various ways. Living, loving, everything else is a matter of the same principles: you learn to work with what you have.","I don't happen to approve of plastic surgery. I think God put plastic surgeons on this earth for good reasons - people get burned or people might have a nose like Pinocchio and that has to be fixed. But to just chop yourself up to look a few years younger? You could come out looking like a Picasso picture.","Self-exploration is very painful, but unless you do that, you will never know who you are and who you want to be.","There's different shopping in Paris than there is at a bazaar in Istanbul, but they're all wonderful.","I'm a practical person. Most fashion people live in the clouds, and they're full of it. I live like a human being - or, I try to - and I have to be intelligent; I have to be practical. I'm a great believer in common sense, and the older I get, I see that common sense is not that common.","Fashion and interior design are one and the same.","Colour can raise the dead.","I think people try so hard to learn everything that they miss all the wonderful essentials. There is so much mystery in life that you should leave a mystery.","Coco Chanel once said that what makes a woman look old is trying desperately to look young. Why should one be ashamed to be 84? Why do you have to say that you're 52? Nobody's going to believe you anyway, so why be such a fool? It's nice that you got to be so old. It's a blessing.","I mix everything up. A museum curator once said to me that there is a great jazz component to the way I do things because good jazz is improvisation and draws elements from all different cultures. And that's the way I do everything - the way I dress and decorate.","You can't try to be somebody you're not; that's not style. If someone says, 'Buy this - you'll be stylish,' you won't be stylish because you won't be you. You have to learn who you are first, and that's painful.","My look is either very baroque or very Zen - everything in between makes me itch.","Nothing I ever did I expected to do. It just kind of happened.","I never had to look for confidence because I just wore what I wanted to wear. I would never wear anything to offend my husband or my mother, but outside of that, I always figured, I hope I'm not a rebel, and I hope everybody liked it. And if they didn't like it, it really was not going to disturb me because it was their problem, not mine.","Throughout history, clothes represented who you were; they are a great vehicle for explaining who you are. During the Ching dynasty, for example, what you wore and how it was made reflected your status in society. People could literally read your clothes like a book, just by its color and how it was embroidered.","Being well-dressed is a wonderful thing, but I don't think it should be life threatening.","I'm not a pretty person. I don't like pretty, so I don't feel badly. Most of the world is not with me, but I don't care.","Nobody is original anymore. Nobody has any original style.","I'm from New York. My grandparents were settlers of Long Island City. When they came here, there was no bridge, and they had to hire a boat across the river. They had a farm, and my grandmother had to go once a week to Manhattan to buy provisions - very primitive.","I don't do very much for beauty. I use very simple things on my skin. I haven't got time. I would always get facials and then come home laden with product, and pay a lot of money and never use it. Anyway, one day a dermatologist told me to use Cetaphil to clean my face and as a moisturizer, and that's what I do.","It's better to be happy than to be well-dressed.","People with a lot of money don't dress as well as people who have to make do, who have to be inventive. Those are the people who are always more interestingly dressed, I think. Everything I do, I do with gut instinct. If I think too much, it won't come out right.","I have ideas that I think might be amusing, and I try them, and if they look right, I carry them out, and if they don't, I throw them out and try something else. I don't agonize about it.","I'm not out to preach. I just live my own life. I'm very happy if I can help somebody - that's wonderful. But it's up to them what they want to think about it or what they want to take away; it's their business, not mine.","I was never a fan of Chanel. I liked it on other people. Some other people. All the ladies who were too plump and busty looked like little sausages.","I love high-end designers, but a head-to-toe designer look for me is extremely boring. I've always mixed it up.","Just because you get to a certain number doesn't mean you have to roll up into a ball and wait for the grim reaper. We were put on this earth to do something! If you stop using your brain, at any age, it is going to stop working. It's like if you stop using your hand, it will atrophy. I think doing nothing is a curse.","I swear on everything holy I do not know what's on the Internet about me.","I had the good fortune to be able to take a course with Margaret Mead. I had a fabulous art course, where it was explained to me that nothing exists in a vacuum, that everything is a result of the period in which it's done - the economics, the sociology, the politics, all sewn together. That was a very important lesson.","My mother was a big influence; she was exceedingly chic, completely dressed in a completely different manner than I did. I was a child of the Depression, so she taught me all about accessories, and I always tell everybody she worships at the altar of the accessory.","The White House is the people's house. When you do historical restoration, that must be what it is.","I'd rather go to a flea market than just about anything. It's the process I like - the same with getting dressed. If I've got someplace to be, I'll spend more time getting dressed than I spent at the actual event. Sometimes. Even in my own closet, I love to dig and search and find.","I don't get dressed up every day. I'm very busy. I get really annoyed when people talk about me as a 'fashionista.' I get dressed up when I have to go out. Most of the time, I'm running around in jeans.","I go out in New York, and I think, boy, you can look at someone and pretty much determine their zip code. Everyone seems to want to conform. I wonder, are they all just button-pressers, on the Internet all day long? I don't know.","Being an individual takes effort. Most people are pretty lazy. And that's OK! I mean, there are more important things than fashion. If it's going to stress you out to have a sense of style, don't do it. The important thing is to be comfortable so you can get on with your life.","I think people should express themselves more and not just buy what's in. While it can be very beautiful, and it may suit you perfectly, I'm sure it doesn't suit everyone in the same way. I like people who express themselves and are more individualistic.","I still have the dress I wore on the first date with my husband, which was more than 66 years ago. I still have it, and it still fits.","In America, it has been proven that the bulk of spending money is in the hands of women between 60 and 80, so it's so stupid. The people who do have the time and money to shop are either retired or empty-nesters.","I think some people like me because I'm different. I don't think like everybody else. People are so tied up in the worst parts of technology these days. They live a life pressing buttons. They don't use their imaginations.","Shock can kill you. Shock is terrible. But what you've got to do is live in the present, which is what I have always done.","There was Pauline de Rothschild, who I thought was very fabulous, and Millicent Rogers, the Standard Oil heiress, very chic, very clever, very original. I admired both those women very much. And I had a great example with my mother, who was extremely chic.","I was in art school since I was five years old. I've always been to art school. Everything that's happened to me, nothing's been planned. I've never had a business plan. I just kind of fell into it, and I liked it, and I took a chance. I took a lot of chances in my life.","I used to love to create outfits, and I still do - I just don't have the time. How can you wear one thing and never wear it again? Even my wedding dress - I had a dress made that I could wear again. I'm a child of the depression, so I'm very, very practical.","Understated jewellery is not for me. It's too itsy-bitsy. My husband is lucky, as I've never had a yen for real jewels.","I live in the Dark Ages, the 17th century. Actually, I would have loved to be in Paris in the early 20th century when the Ballets Russes were there and Chanel was designing.","I had a very brilliant father who was not only intellectual, but was street-smart and very curious to boot. The day I found out that he didn't know everything, I grew up. It was a shock. I just thought that the man was the end-all of everything, and he knew the answer to everything. Then I found out I'd have to find out my own answers.","I like to improvise.","Creativity is down the tube. And people give a lot of lip service to individuality. I know they all appreciate it, but they all say they would like to do it, but they don't want to work at it, and it doesn't come out of the sky.","I think people have to sharpen their eyes and look. I always feel like a big sponge: I feel like I learn lots of things by osmosis, and I feel that I'm always absorbing. I mean, when people say, 'What is your inspiration?' I could throw up. I mean, I'm inspired by the fact I get up in the morning. And I'm still here.","I get very involved with my things, and they are not standard equipment.","I just roll with the punches.","Technologically, I live in the 17th century; I don't have a computer, I don't have any of that stuff. I don't look at the Internet, although I know people tell me I'm all over it. Somebody told me they Googled me, and they said I was mentioned two million times, some stupid thing... but who cares?","Technology is a wonderful thing, but I think it's violently misused.","I've never seen anything like the way some young people behave. They go out on a date, and they're sitting opposite each other at a table, and they're not looking at each other, and they text each other as though they're deaf-mutes. It's insane.","Clothes are not frippery. Properly done, they can be an art form.","Fashion really is women's liberation in a lot of ways. Look at how many women in this country are depressed about how they look and how they think they have to look! It's really sad. And it's not about money.","I always tell people I'm very large in Uzbekistan.","I wasn't interested at all in doing a documentary. I was not a public figure.","I don't look at Instagram. I don't have much to do with social media.","People say, 'You have inspired me, you've given me courage...' They've gone so far as to say, 'You've changed my life!' And I would come back and say to my husband, 'I can't understand it - what kind of poor little life did she have if I had to come and change it?'","In my view, you can't go to the future if you haven't come from the past.","You can be born with the talent to be an opera star, but you've got to work and practice it.","I call myself a geriatric starlet.","I absolutely consider fashion a form of art. Of course, there is some fashion that is not art at all - it's utilitarian, made for the purpose of covering up. And there are a lot of people out there who put a lot of effort into looking awful. But there are also people putting the same amount of energy into making bad art.","We did major work at the White House. But what people often don't understand is that when you do a historic restoration, you can't just do whatever you want. You work alongside the fine-arts commission and are obliged to create a replica of the past, as close as humanly possible. It's a historic institution, not a showhouse.","I never buy what someone says is 'in' or a 'must-have.' I buy what makes me happy.","You don't find out who you are unless you work at it.","The fashion industry has done itself in by neglecting the 60- to 80-year-old market. They have the time and the economic resources. They want to go shopping.","Fashion has this youth mania. But 70-year-old ladies don't have 18-year-old bodies, and 18-year-olds don't have a 70-year-old's dollars.","I hate being asked how I met my husband and very personal questions like that. I don't like that. People are too nosey. Intelligent questions I like, but sometimes people ask such silly, dopey ones.","I was always known in my industry, and I always enjoyed a modicum of popularity.","I'm happy. I give thanks every morning that I can get up, that I still have my husband with me. I'm extremely grateful. After all, how many 93-year-old cover girls do you know?","Anything that's feathery-looking, I love.","I've always loved to help people, young people in particular.","I'm not a collector of clothes. I've got clothes to wear.","I didn't have children, but I never wanted children."],"Iris Chang":["I have certainly amassed many historical research gathering skills.","Whatever is not commonly seen is condemned as alien.","There isn't much in the way of pure communist spirit, because the whole nation seems to be engaged in capitalistic enterprises. Much of the country still operates under government control.","Your first duty as a writer is to write to please yourself. And you have no duty towards anyone else.","There are now hundreds of thousands of new engineers that are being trained in China. If people start finding themselves losing their jobs, not to the Chinese here but because China has become such a dominant force - then there could very well be a backlash.","We have to keep in mind that it's not just about the numbers of people who died; it's also the manner which many of these victims met their deaths.","Almost all people have this potential for evil, which would be unleashed only under certain dangerous social circumstances.","Of course, in the United States, which at the time was a very young country, there were also class distinctions. They weren't as pronounced, but they quickly evolved as well.","There isn't much discussion of ruling class in America even in Boston, probably one of the most class-conscious cities in the country?","It was clear that the special interest groups in California really wanted the Chinese to be shut out of the country, because that was where the racial tension was the greatest.","Somebody who was born in this country who visited China would later face difficulty getting back in to the USA. We have to keep in mind that the struggles of the Chinese against these exclusion laws really laid down the foundations of civil rights law.","Racism is always there underneath, but usually it is exploited in these times of economic crisis, and it's hard to find out when one slides into another.","It's much more difficult to work on a broad subject than on a specific one, because even if it's hard to find the information, if you look hard enough for something specific you will find it, and you will discover things that you wouldn't have thought of before.","When you take something extremely broad, then it is not a work of expansion or work of compression. It's hard because you have to decide what to throw out.","The worst... was what the Pakistani soldiers did to the Bengali women after their failed rebellion.","The whole story of the comfort women, the system of forced sexual slavery, the medical experiments of Unit 731, is not something that is in the US psyche. That is changing because many books are coming out.","If the conditions were right there could be great acceptance. Often it is only when they pose an economic or political threat that it turns really ugly.","When the Chinese first came to San Francisco, they were actually welcomed by the mayor and they had special ceremonies for them-again this is when their colony was very small, only a few Chinese.","They probably do have an Asian Barbie.","Now, most of the new immigrants coming to this country are from Asia as opposed to Europe.","There is also an epidemic of infertility in this country. There are more women who have put off child-bearing in favor of their professional lives. For them, the only way they are going to have a family is to adopt from China.","It's a wonderful thing to see a segment of our population that is open and eager to learn more about Chinese culture. It has filtered into the mainstream. You see credit-card ads on TV with white couples and Chinese babies.","It is very difficult to hang onto the relics of history.","Often, what you see in the media is driven by economic forces.","I have to finish this book tour of almost 30 cities.","After working as a journalist I went to a writing program at Johns Hopkins. It was interesting because it was neither journalistic nor historical, but it emphasized writing style, and afterwards I was asked to write my first book.","I received an honorary doctorate for my work. Maybe one of these works is considered the equivalent of a Ph.D.","I may attempt a novel. I think that no matter what you write, it requires being honest with oneself, and you have to pull yourself out of the whirlwind of daily life.","I don't mind solitude. I love talking to other people, but I do need my space.","For some reason, I seem to be bothered whenever I see acts of injustice and assaults on people's civil liberties. I imagine what I write in the future will follow in that vein. Whether it's fiction or non-fiction."],"Iris Dement":["My guitar is really tempermental. I don't give up on it though, I'm close to my guitar!","And I've been walking 'round with memories way too long.","Some guy refuses to fight and we call that the sin, but he's standing up for what he believes in and that seems pretty damned American to me.","Making the record was tons of fun, the most fun I've ever had.","Writing, overall, has never been what I'd call fun. It's fulfilling. It doesn't come real easy for me.","I don't know what other people are like, I haven't been able to crawl inside anybody else.","Maybe I spent more time dwelling on emotions than some people, and maybe that's why I ended up writing.","I don't describe myself as a Christian or religious, but I like to think that how I live my life is honest.","Turn off the TV and start digging around for information that's not from a corporation trying to make money.","I honestly don't listen to a lot of music - I spend so much time working at my own music.","I've always written about things that cause me to feel something.","Most of the music you hear on the radio today is developed for making money. It doesn't feel true or honest. You can feel it in the music.","This is how it has been since time began: If you want to make something really worthwhile and true, then you have to suffer for it.","I never set out to write songs about the world around me... it just kind of came about as a result of paying more attention to things.","I was mainly influenced by the Carter Family, Jimmie Rodgers, Loretta Lynn, Merle Haggard, and others like Bob Dylan, Johnny Cash.","For a long time I was interested in being a social worker. In a lot of ways I feel that that's all my music is, trying to help people.","If something bothers me, it bothers me for a long time until I find a way to work it out. Music provided me with a means of working things out.","I've always been aware of having feelings that were pretty intense at times. I imagine most people have had that, or they wouldn't be human."],"Iris Johansen":["I was just as voracious a writer as I was a reader.","The greatest compliment a writer can be given is that a story and character hold a reader spellbound. I'm caught up in the story writing and I miss a good deal of sleep thinking about it and working out the plot points.","Writers are always critical of themselves and I'm no exception. I always feel that maybe I could have done better.","I am more of a suspense writer. A mystery writer solves mysteries. I am a 'high suspense' writer.","Mystery writing involves solving a puzzle, but 'high suspense' writing is a situation whereby the writer thrusts the hero/heroine into high drama.","I write 'by the seat of my pants.' I love to do research. I am inspired by contemporary writers and contemporary events. I live in the real world.","After the children grew up, I began to focus on my writing. My first books were part of a trilogy... The 'Wind Dance' trilogy."],"Iris Murdoch":["We live in a fantasy world, a world of illusion. The great task in life is to find reality.","Happiness is a matter of one's most ordinary and everyday mode of consciousness being busy and lively and unconcerned with self.","Falling out of love is chiefly a matter of forgetting how charming someone is.","Art is the final cunning of the human soul which would rather do anything than face the gods.","We can only learn to love by loving.","The priesthood is a marriage. People often start by falling in love, and they go on for years without realizing that love must change into some other love which is so unlike it that it can hardly be recognized as love at all.","Perhaps misguided moral passion is better than confused indifference.","Moralistic is not moral. And as for truth - well, it's like brown - it's not in the spectrum. Truth is so generic.","In philosophy if you aren't moving at a snail's pace you aren't moving at all.","Anything that consoles is fake.","Philosophy! Empty thinking by ignorant conceited men who think they can digest without eating!","No love is entirely without worth, even when the frivolous calls to the frivolous and the base to the base.","People from a planet without flowers would think we must be mad with joy the whole time to have such things about us.","The cry of equality pulls everyone down.","Perhaps when distant people on other planets pick up some wavelength of ours all they hear is a continuous scream.","Love is the difficult realization that something other than oneself is real.","Literature could be said to be a sort of disciplined technique for arousing certain emotions.","Every man needs two women: a quiet home-maker, and a thrilling nymph.","I daresay anything can be made holy by being sincerely worshipped.","Falling out of love is very enlightening. For a short while you see the world with new eyes.","There is no substitute for the comfort supplied by the utterly taken-for-granted relationship.","He was a sociologist; he had got into an intellectual muddle early on in life and never managed to get out.","Between saying and doing, many a pair of shoes is worn out.","The absolute yearning of one human body for another particular body and its indifference to substitutes is one of life's major mysteries.","In almost every marriage there is a selfish and an unselfish partner. A pattern is set up and soon becomes inflexible, of one person always making the demands and one person always giving way.","All art is a struggle to be, in a particular sort of way, virtuous.","I see myself as Rhoda, not Mary Tyler Moore.","Writing is like getting married. One should never commit oneself until one is amazed at one's luck.","Only lies and evil come from letting people off.","Being good is just a matter of temperament in the end.","A bad review is even less important than whether it is raining in Patagonia.","Human affairs are not serious, but they have to be taken seriously.","The notion that one will not survive a particular catastrophe is, in general terms, a comfort since it is equivalent to abolishing the catastrophe.","I think being a woman is like being Irish. Everyone says you're important and nice, but you take second place all the same.","We shall be better prepared for the future if we see how terrible, how doomed the present is.","One doesn't have to get anywhere in a marriage. It's not a public conveyance."],"Irma S. Rombauer":["Most cocktails containing liquor are made today with gin and ingenuity. In brief, take an ample supply of the former and use your imagination. For the benefit of a minority, it is courteous to serve chilled fruit juice in addition to cocktails made with liquor.","I know who in the family is a great cook. I know where the great recipes are.","Soybeans really need an uplift, being on the dull side, but, like dull people, respond readily to the right contacts.","A pig resembles a saint in that he is more honored after death than during his lifetime.","Custard puddings, sauces and fillings accompany the seven ages of man in sickness and in health.","The automatic bread maker is not as good as breads made by hand, but waking up to the smell of fresh bread is worth the price of admission. We use it for fresh cinnamon raisin toast - mmmmmmm!","The new 'Joy' was needed for a number of reasons. Recent developments in nutrition and new ingredients were two of the major reasons for the revision. One of the other big reasons was America's new love for big flavors. Yay!"],"IronE Singleton":["There's nothing more liberating about starting with something that is not written. You pretty much create the history of that character and that character's life story.","Whatever you do, whatever you come up with, whatever you decide on, you can go with it, and if the director or the execs, they like it, then you'll stick with it. That's a good thing, as opposed to having something that's already written.","With film, you stop and go. You have to do 20 takes or whatever.","My daughter was born when I was nowhere near where I am now, and she took me to another level. I said, 'I have to become a better person in this life if I want to serve as an example. If I want to set a positive example for her, I need to get better myself.'","'IronE' stands for an eagle in flight with an unbroken spirit. I coined that term because it is indicative of my life story and the fact that I'm out of the inner city.","I always had a relationship with God as early as 8 years old. I can remember having these conversations with God. I'd go in the bathroom and look in the mirror and talk to myself, but then I knew I was not the only one present.","There were a lot of moments in my life where I could have died or I could have ended up serving 20 years to life in prison. I overcame those things, those obstacles, because I listened and I obeyed that higher power that was speaking to me at the crucial moments in my life when it really counted.","My grandmother was the matriarch. I was the youngest of all the men in my family, so I kind of used them as examples and kind of emulated what I saw them do. So I didn't have to deal with a lot of bullying because we had a lot of back-up, so to speak.","My life also prepared me to play T-Dog. That was what my entire life was about - surviving. To be on the set of 'The Walking Dead,' it was like being back home. I had to survive again, though in the fictional world.","We have to recognize that we're all one, we all come from the same place, we come from the same source.","Communication is number one, and we have to communicate honestly and openly with each other.","Change won't happen overnight."],"Irrfan Khan":["The sign of a good society is where talent is respected.","I've realized that my... let me call it 'destiny' or some force that has pushed me to identify looking for your comfort zone as a kind of limitation. And everybody has a tendency to fall into the comfort zone. I did that in the early stage of my career.","Parsi theater was known for melodrama.","It's always an inner wish of every actor to reach out to maximum audiences.","Language does not make one an elite.","You cannot reduce the power of story with the tag of money because it's not a share market. So you must know the seriousness of the power of storytelling.","We don't have a culture of realistic acting in India.","Sometimes when you're playing a very intense character, a disturbed character, you find other layers. That's much more interesting to me, rather than just playing 'intense.' I find it too boring.","I can't think of a more pathetic situation for an actor than to do a film and not connect to it. And I pray to God that I never face that situation.","A film engages you emotionally and intellectually.","I'm trying to strike a balance between Bollywood and Hollywood.","I will only do a Hollywood film when there is something special offered to me.","When you come out of the theatre and you don't even talk about that film or remember it, then it disappoints me.","I cannot live anywhere else except India.","A nation needs to know how to utilise talent.","I am not ready to fit into the mould of commercial cinema.","I've played many characters that have consumed me and owned me.","Our Bollywood stars who talk of being part of 100 crore films, I think I belong to the 1,000 crore club.","I don't want to do romantic roles where I have to lip sync to a song. A role that explores romance on a new level would suit me.","I want to entertain people, but with some substance.","For me, acting is becoming naked in front of people, you know? And when you know in the back of your mind somebody is testing you, you cannot really bare yourself. That's a feeling I always have when I'm auditioning.","What happens with every role, you have to trick yourself, you have to creatively find ways to explore the mental state of your character.","In India, therapy is not part of the culture; it has not become such a big need.","I was going through a crisis once, so I went to therapy because I was so unbearable for myself.","Hollywood isn't ready for an Indian leading man.","Maybe to become famous is to reassure yourself that whatever you're lacking inside, you've fulfilled that.","I am lucky that the Western world chooses me to play roles in their movies an television, whatever language it may be.","It surely gives you a high to be an international actor with quality work.","Cinema is changing every week, and multiplex audiences are demanding every week.","I can recite poetry, but I cannot write it."],"Irv Kupcinet":["An optimist is a person who starts a new diet on Thanksgiving Day.","As a kid, I'd get up at 3 in the morning during school vacations to help my father on his bakery-truck route. He didn't get a vacation from that schedule.","What can you say about a society that says that God is dead and Elvis is alive?","I wish all high schools could offer students the outside activities that were available at the old Harrison High on Chicago's West Side in the late '20s. They enabled me to become part of a school newspaper, drama group, football team and student government.","My father, a bakery-truck driver, was the epitome of the work ethic that probably kept me knocking out columns six days a week for a rough total of 12,600 over 50 years.","By the time I got to Northwestern University in 1930, I was a football bum more interested in being an All-Star player and signing on with a pro team than going after a newspaper job.","Chicago, with its big newspapers and major broadcasting stations, couldn't have been a better city to start a journalism career.","I've never wanted to do anything but be a newspaperman ever since I was 13.","My freshman year at Harrison High School, I saw a journalism class where students were putting out a weekly newspaper. It touched a responsive chord in me.","'At Random' ran on Saturday nights for as long as the conversation was still lively. Sometimes, I'd finish way after midnight, then hop a plane for whatever city I was working a football game that Sunday."],"Irvin D. Yalom":["I do not like to work with patients who are in love. Perhaps it is because of envy - I, too, crave enchantment. Perhaps it is because love and psychotherapy are fundamentally incompatible. The good therapist fights darkness and seeks illumination, while romantic love is sustained by mystery and crumbles upon inspection.","The ultimate goal of therapy... it's too hard a question. The words come to me like tranquility, like fulfillment, like realizing your potential.","With almost every book I've written, my secret target audience is the young therapist. In this way, I am staying in my professorial role; I'm writing teaching stories and teaching novels.","I believe that a different therapy must be constructed for each patient because each has a unique story.","I think all kinds of meanings in life transcend your self. They're linked to other generations of people around us, to our children and our family. We're passing on something of ourselves to others. I feel that's what makes our life full of meaning.","We're not teaching our students the importance of relationships with other people: how you work with them, what the relational pathology consists of, how you examine your own conscience, how you examine the inner world, how you examine your dreams.","The amount of death terror experienced is closely related to the amount of life unlived.","When people don't have any curiosity about themselves, that is always a bad sign.","From the very early days of seeing patients, I noticed that many of them seemed to be concerned with issues of their mortality, and so the philosophy training I had taken began to seem rather important to me.","I'm a compulsive reader of fiction. I fell in love with novels when I was a teenager. My wife Marilyn and I... our initial friendship began because we are both readers. I've gone to sleep almost every night of my life after having read in a novel for 30 or 40 minutes. I'm a great reader of fiction and much less so of non-fiction.","I think everybody I've seen has come from some other therapy, and almost invariably, it's very much the same thing: the therapist is too disinterested, a little too aloof, a little too inactive. They're not really interested in the person; he doesn't relate to the person.","Sometime early in life, I developed the notion - one which I have never relinquished - that writing a novel is the very finest thing a person can do.","We're passing on something of ourselves to others. I feel that's what makes our life full of meaning. It's hard to have meaning in a closet, encapsulated by nothing. I think you really have to expand yourself and your life and do what you can for other people.","Therapists need to have a long experience in personal therapy to see what it's like to be on the other side of the couch and see what they find helpful or not helpful.","I wrote my first textbook in 1970. It was called 'The Theory and Practice of Group Psychotherapy,' and over the years, many students told me that they enjoyed reading it because there were so many stories in there; often just a paragraph or a page of something that happened in a group session.","I always wanted to be a writer. Maybe, had I been brought up in another generation, I might have just gone into writing rather than medicine - which is not to say that I didn't also have a great attraction towards the idea of being a healer. Fortunately, I've been able to combine the two in ways I could never possibly have imagined.","I have a lot of blurring between fiction and non-fiction in so many of my works. For example, my first novel, 'When Nietzsche Wept,' has a great deal of non-fiction in it. I didn't create many characters at all. Almost all of them are historical characters that actually existed.","I don't want to be idealized by a patient because of what I've written.","During my childhood, Washington was a segregated city, and I lived in the midst of a poor black neighborhood. Life on the streets was often perilous. Indoor reading was my refuge, and twice a week, I made the hazardous bicycle trek to the central library at Seventh and K streets to stock up on supplies."],"Irvin Kershner":["Film is a window to the real world but a lie that makes you believe the unbelievable.","There's nothing more interesting than the landscape of the human face.","In the last ten years of watching films I have found that some of the foreign films I saw affected me most. One American film that stands out for me for its workmanship and artistry is 'Ratatouille.' It was an astonishing effort in filmmaking.","It's a matter of pride to me to get the film done fast, to get it done well. I understand the need for compromise. There is no such thing as a perfect shot, a perfect film. The purpose of film is not to make a monument to oneself.","I have not given much credence to reviews of my films. Sometimes they're wrong, but it didn't matter to me.","I have not been a follower of how many millions my films made or did not make.","I love my early movies, but naturalism is an artist's early style. Now I want to deal with feelings, dreams, an acceptance of irrationality.","I want films to haunt an audience, to give them something to remember and be able to talk about.","After 'The Empire Strikes Back,' I got to make big films that I didn't care about, 'Never Say Never Again' and 'RoboCop 2,' and then I got too old."],"Irvin Mayfield":["I miss my dad, yes. But I try to honor his memory, as well as all the victims of Hurricane Katrina, through the love I have for all humanity, a love I try to express through my music.","I think, you know, people think of the city of New Orleans as a parochial place where it's a lot of folks who are from there and a lot of big families, a lot of musical families, a lot of history, a lot of tradition, but I like to think of New Orleans as an idea.","The reason New Orleans is still around is because of the celebrations it has inspired since its inception as a city. I'm always excited about the possibility of what might happen. That's what drives us, and I think that's the spirit of New Orleans and the spirit of jazz.","When you celebrate, it's something that happens as a group. But when you mourn, sorrow is something that you handle as an individual.","One of the things I love about jazz music is that intent is first and execution is second. In classical music, execution is first and intent is second, meaning that you must first learn a piece before you can truly add your interpretation to it.","I think we have gotten to a point as Americans, unfortunately, where we take for granted the magic that life brings and that life is really special and every life matters. We tend to go through life but not take the moment to step back and remember you are here, right now, for a very finite amount of time.","Art gives us an opportunity to not have to leave or go somewhere or do something to experience the magic in our lives. It actually gets us to sit back and be where we are and recognize we're already magical.","I don't see myself only as a member of the New Orleans community. I see myself as a part of the human community. I see myself as a part of the community that's trying to put things in the world that add value to people's lives.","I chose New Orleans because New Orleans chose me. This city gave me my dad and my love of life.","A degree is an asset, but it doesn't mean anything by itself. It's just another asset. So is being persuasive, having good personality, being smart.","Culture is important. Wars are fought over culture. It's not just about folks showing up and being hoity-toity. Culture is about definition.","I think there's no greater healing power than music.","I really wanted to give people that tool, that thing, that answer, 'Well, what are you going to do after Katrina? How does New Orleans come back?' And I'm thinking to myself, New Orleans is back. We're the definition of 'back.' We're the definition of 'rebirth,' of 'renaissance.'","It's important to recognize how special New Orleans is. You play the snare drum or the clarinet in any other city, and you'd be considered a nerd, but here, there's no shame in it, and it's absolutely valued."],"Irvin S. Cobb":["As I understand it, sport is hard work for which you do not get paid.","A woman may have a witty tongue or a stinging pen but she will never laugh at her own individual shortcomings.","An epitaph is a belated advertisement for a line of goods that has been discontinued.","A good storyteller is a person with a good memory and hopes other people haven't.","If writers were good businessmen, they'd have too much sense to be writers.","I've just learned about his illness. Let's hope it's nothing trivial.","Humor is merely tragedy standing on its head with its pants torn.","A funeral eulogy is a belated plea for the defense delivered after the evidence is all in.","Middle age: when you begin to exchange your emotions for symptoms."],"Irvine Welsh":["It's part of me, Scotland. I'm still immersed in it even though I am not there.","When people start writing there is this idea that you have to get everything right first time, every sentence has to be perfect, every paragraph has to be perfect, every chapter has to be perfect, but what you're doing is not any kind of public show, until you're ready for it.","Middle-class people worry a lot about money. They worry a lot about job security, and they do a lot of nine-to-five stuff.","Underground people pay a desperate toll finding out things nobody else has discovered yet. We run around like headless chickens looking for the next cultural fix to spiral around in before it gets appropriated somewhere else and becomes something it never was. There's this sort of one-upmanship in the underground.","What worries me is the professionalism of everything.","Historically, men have a hard time getting onboard with feminism, but I think that's changing.","Hugo Boss is my kind of label.","I enjoy the freedom of the blank page.","I've eaten ice cream from all over the world, but until you've tasted Graham's from Geneva, Illinois, you haven't had ice cream at all.","I think young writers should get other degrees first, social sciences, arts degrees or even business degrees. What you learn is research skills, a necessity because a lot of writing is about trying to find information.","It was around the summer of 1982 when the drug problem really impacted. It became a lifestyle rather than a recreation. When you start lying and stealing, you cannot con yourself you're in control any more.","I tried to write 'Trainspotting' in standard English, but people weren't talking like that.","People either think I'm this totally savage, idiot-savant genius guy who's lucked out or they think I'm a super-manipulative crafty businessman, this kind of MBA guy who's spotted a gap in the market and knows how to create a product for it. It's flattering, but I've not got that much of a gameplan.","Words should have the power to inform and to move, not the power to send people scurrying away. But if you attach that much emotional energy to a word, it gives people the power to hurt each other.","I make out a play list for every character and buy the records they would listen to; it helps me find their personas. What they play, where they stay, who they lay, is my matrix for character development.","I grew up in a place where everybody was a storyteller, but nobody wrote. It was that kind of Celtic, storytelling tradition: everybody would have a story at the pub or at parties, even at the clubs and raves.","I don't want everything to be flowery perfection. I like it there to be a charge behind it, you know?","Standard English is very imperialistic, controlled, and precise; it's not got a lot of funk or soul to it.","You can't satirise darts, because it's hyper-real as it is; there's already enough over-the-top madness to it.","You're on your own with the book. And while you are writing fiction, you're spending all this time with people who don't actually exist, which is just madness.","There's something about the modern era where it's very hard to transgress - we're all so online, easier to track by mobile phone - so you have people who do it on your behalf.","I go to the gym and work through a routine. But if you see someone with a personal trainer, you know they do 10 times more than you do. You give up your sense of identity. If you watch 'The Biggest Loser,' you see people give up their identity to become something else.","I spend so much time on the screen when I am writing, the last thing you want to do is spend more time on the Internet looking at a screen. That's what I hate about all this technology.","Basically, particularly in Britain, it's a hegemonic thing that people who write tend to come from the leisure classes. They can afford the time and the books.","Every kind of book I've written has been written in a different way. There has not been any set time for writing, any set way, I haven't re-invented the process every time but I almost have.","I didn't have any concept of Trainspotting being published. It was a selfish act. I did it for myself.","I feel like I've exhausted guys and male friendships.","I tend to read more nonfiction, really, because when I'm writing I don't like to read other fiction.","I wanted to capture the excitement of house music, almost like a four-four beat, and the best way to do that was to use a language that was rhythmic and performative.","I'd always liked to read, but when I picked up books I wasn't getting the same kind of excitement from them that I was from going out clubbing. I wanted to get the same kind of feel.","I'm always watching people over a short time frame, putting them in an extreme position. Sometimes you don't see the humanity in a person because the time frame is so short and the circumstance so extreme.","I'm working on a screenplay right now for the BBC, but I hope to have the decks cleared soon so I can get into the studio with my pals and put down some more tracks, try to get a strong dance single together.","Sometimes there's a snobbery among literary types that these people don't really get it, but in a lot of ways they get it more than the literati. There's a culture in the background that they understand and know. They get that deeper level.","The establishment, the newspapers, they try to create something called Scottish literature, but when people are actually going to write, they are not going to necessarily prescribe to that, they'll write what they feel.","The first job of a writer is to be honest.","There is a kind of mysticism to writing.","There's all this stuff that is happening in Edinburgh now, it's a sad attempt to create an Edinburgh society, similar to a London society, a highbrow literature celebrity society.","When I first started to get into writing, it was via music. I'd generate ideas for songs that would turn into stories, then they'd turn into novels. I was biased toward music.","When I started off with Trainspotting, it was the way the characters came to me. That's how they sounded to me. It seemed pretentious to sound any other way. I wasn't making any kind of political statement.","When I'm not writing, I read loads of fiction, but I've been writing quite constantly lately so I've been reading a lot of nonfiction - philosophy, religion, science, history, social or cultural studies.","Writing is about culture and should be about everything. That's what makes it what it is.","It's different in Scotland. People who come to readings are more interested in literature as such, but the readership in general is really quite diverse. It's a cliche, but it's said that people who read my books don't read any other books, and you do get that element.","I know when I go and see a writer, the first thing I think to myself is, 'Are they the character in the book?' You just can't help it; it's the way people are.","It's that kind of thing that readers have. I have it as a reader myself: that expectation that the writer will be that person. Then I meet other writers and realize that they're not.","It's like nothing's really happening. Our culture is almost dead.","When you grow up in a place, you always think it's mundane. Then you travel around and live in different places, and you realise that you've got it the wrong way 'round.","It's where you come from that's the strange, exotic, quirky, mad place.","When people write a novel, they want to have that reach and that impact. To get it with a first novel, you can either see it as an albatross or a calling card.","I created something that became a phenomenon without becoming a prisoner to it.","I just want to get on and tell stories.","We have to give feminism a shot. Out of sheer self preservation, we have to stand aside and let women run the show.","'Ulysses' is like a big box of tricks that you can dive into. Each time you read it, you find something new.","Sometimes a book influences me because it winds me up. There'll be something that gets under my skin and makes me think that I can do better.","I'm the worst employee in the world. I'll cheat and steal time and resources from my employer, although I'll con everybody into believing I'm essential to the operation.","I'm the worst employer I could wish for because I push myself hard.","When I left school at 16, I became an apprentice television and radio technician, and was paid £17 a week, which was decent money in 1976. But the job turned sour when I gave myself an electric shock while repairing a television set.","I left Edinburgh to follow the London punk scene in 1978, singing and playing guitar in various bands. My income was sporadic, so I did anything to eke out some kind of subsistence - laying down slabs, working as a kitchen porter.","It's very difficult to be objective about yourself and your own circumstances, but one thing I do know about is that I grew up surrounded by storytellers.","Everybody in my family were great storytellers. My dad and his brothers would just go on and on; they could tell amazing stories. I think it was something to do with the Celtic, oral storytelling tradition. People very much had that propensity towards telling tales.","The idea is not enough. And the most annoying thing for me as a writer is that people will come up to me and say, 'Hey, I've got a great idea for a book. I'm not a writer, but I've got a great story.'","That's the kind of consumer society we live in. We're always looking for the next product that's going to change your life instead of just going out and changing your life.","A lot of people pulled me up after 'Trainspotting' for its absence of politics, but the argument I make is that the absence of politics is political as well.","Before I started writing, I'd never read much fiction. I was more interested in non-fiction. I'm taking the same approach to theatre: I can operate from a position of ignorance and make up my own rules instead of being bound by customs and practice.","From 'Trainspotting' to 'Acid House,' I moved from urban realism into fantasy.","So many people have become divorced from the system, criminalised by their lifestyle.","I just love the weather. I live on Miami Beach, which is all boutique hotels and cocktails. I do sometimes go along to smart parties in my white suit, but I wouldn't really recognise any famous people if they were there because I'm not very good at star-spotting.","The idea of just sitting at home on Facebook worries me. I think we should all get out more.","I think that every project offers an opportunity to reinvent process as well as content.","Sometimes I work purely 8-12 shifts, banging stuff into the computer. Other times, my office is like a scene from a detective movie, with Post-it Notes, plans, photographs all stuck on the walls and arrows going everywhere, and it's 4 A.M.","I don't perceive an audience at all when I write a book. It's pure self-indulgence.","I think the novel is at one end of the art-entertainment continuum - the play in the middle - while TV and cinema veer a bit more towards entertainment.","It's been a good thing for me to try and understand America.","In my flat in Chicago, I've got this big room with an office in the corner and a balcony so I can watch people go by.","I used to sit on the Circle Line and go 'round and 'round and write.","We want to feel hyper-alive, and it's like, the more cartoonish and grotesque the level we can operate at, the better. It's like the world we live in has become quite safe in a lot of ways, and it has become harder to genuinely transgress. But the desire to transgress is a real feeling.","Television has become the government, priest, psychotherapist - the legitimiser of our egos.","As soon as you've written it, you're thinking about how it can move into different mediums.","The '90s was a decade of mundane market-consumer nothingness where there was nothing coming up from the streets; you just had someone in an office deciding what was cool.","Filmmaking is a much more collaborative thing than literature, so you know you're going to be working with a group of people at the start. You know it's going to be a compromise.","For 'Filth,' we had about 12 producers on the thing. The opening credits go on for months. Most of them are actually financers rather than producers. And the only way that we could raise the budget without interference from a studio was to have a lot of different financers on board.","Everyone needs some kind of compelling drama in their life, basically.","I'm probably a natural uncle. I can take the kids out and have fun with them and look after them, and I can be Mr. Popular. But actually having to do the grind? That stuff just doesn't appeal at all.","I've been doing a bit of screenwriting and producing, and even a bit of directing.","In America, Miramax are using a 'New York Times' review that said 'Trainspotting' makes 'Kids' look like a 1960s episode of 'Sesame Street.'","It's really odd that I've got this kind of sullen reputation - I never saw myself that way.","I'm trying to make really flawed characters that have got redeeming features so people can say, 'I don't really like that character, but I can understand a bit where they've come from.'","I think a lot of people want me to be like the characters in the books: they want that kind of congruence.","The older you get, the less physically and mentally robust you become.","A lot of my characters are anti-heroes that became heroes.","Writing is such a good thing to do because you can't really get bored with it. If you're bored with writing, you're bored with life.","Everybody that writes has their own area of inquiry. And mine has always been kind of, why is it that when life can be so hard and difficult, we compound it by self-sabotage, doing terrible things? That's always been my main area of inquiry, and it does lead you to dark places.","I come up with a blurb at the beginning, but the book will always be completely different by the time it's finished. They say, 'Where's the book you were going to write?' And I say, 'Forget about it. It doesn't exist.'","Writing has been handed to me on a plate.","If you're going to do something that's going to cause offence to people, you're always going to get a reaction.","What happens when you get any kind of entrenched power is that it just becomes kind of corrupt and self-serving.","How can you be inspired by Cameron and Miliband? These guys are just drabness personified.","Politicians are so... detested; they don't actually walk amongst people now.","There is nothing, really, that I wouldn't write about, and I do write about a lot of grim things.","I think the silences we have on some issues are inductive of the fact that we need to write about them more, but I think there are some issues you have to write in a sensitive way and in a way that respects the reality of the situation. If you can't do that, you should leave them alone.","When you go away, you see where you come from in a different light. I see Scotland, and the rest of Britain, as much more exotic than I used to.","When a town doesn't have a book store, it is like something is missing, and unfortunately, fewer and fewer have them.","People in Scotland want the parliament but don't give a toss about the elections.","People should be able to express their culture without getting into all that chauvinistic thing.","It's ironic that the growth of Scottish nationalism has precipitated in the English the sort of hand-wringing the Scots have always done over who they are.","People think if you're working class, there has to be some fascist element underneath.","I'm a failed musician rather than a successful writer.","Music helps me immeasurably in the writing process.","I have a lot of successful musician pals, and as I get older, I find that I'm lucky to be a writer. I have great anonymity compared to musicians who sell the same number of records as I do books.","I just write the stuff I want to at the time, what feels right for me.","We've become used to processing images that are part of the non-linear narrative theory. I think there's a thinner line between fantasy and normality. People spend much more time in their own heads now. There's so much to conform to, so many influences coming at you.","I think what you call 'metropolitan America' - as in San Francisco, New York and Los Angeles - I think there's more awareness of the atypical, while in more traditional Britain, there's the kitchen-sink dramas and thrillers. It's more formulaic.","You know what it's like: you don't want to read your old books again. All you can see are the flaws, what you would do differently.","I'm not really a mainstream novelist!","Writers in Britain aren't really celebrities. You become kind of a darling of a small set.","One of the things you want as a successful writer is the anonymity.","Dean Owens is Scotland's most engaging and haunting singer-songwriter.","Holy Joy were a cult '80s band led by the wonderful songwriting genius that is Johny Brown.","I would never have written 'Trainspotting' if it hadn't been for this album, 'Raw Power,' and 'Metallic K.O.'","'True Detective' was the last show I got crazy about, with its 'Silence of the Lambs'-style landscape and those strip mall badlands of America.","Boxing gives you such a good workout, although I've stopped sparring. When your hand speed goes, you're going to get caught, and you can't afford to take cumulative smacks on the chops when you're a writer.","The cultural war of words has actually been won by the most dispossessed people in the Western world, the urban American blacks.","Rebellion is always going to fascinate, as it's always packaged in a very safe way.","It's very hard to transgress; we have the furniture of transgression without the imagery and iconography to actually do it."],"Irving Azoff":["History shows fans want consolidation; you see it across the web every place. The big players are people like Google, Amazon, eBay, Facebook.","I'm proud to be involved with Simon Cowell and 'X Factor.'","The release of 'Chinese Democracy' marks a historic moment in rock n' roll.","Radio stinks. The stations are making a lot of money, but they just aren't taking chances.","Since the traditional recorded-music business models have drastically changed, there is truly diminished income derived from recorded music by artists - both current and catalog. The touring industry has become much more important as a majority revenue stream and the ancillary fan experiences and promotions that may be derived from it.","The great thing about Ticketmaster is that it's seen as the comprehensive site for ticketing, artist information, venue information. We're a marketing platform, not just a technology platform, and we're going to build on it.","I can't think of any more powerful moment than when you stand on a stage.","Life at a public company ain't for me. The board pays you what you're worth, then you get reamed for your compensation.","You can't be an entrepreneur and work in a public company anymore.","Recorded music is more a marketing tool than a revenue source."],"Irving Babbitt":["The industrial revolution has tended to produce everywhere great urban masses that seem to be increasingly careless of ethical standards.","A person who has sympathy for mankind in the lump, faith in its future progress, and desire to serve the great cause of this progress, should be called not a humanist, but a humanitarian, and his creed may be designated as humanitarianism.","Democracy is now going forth on a crusade against imperialism.","Anyone who thus looks up has some chance of becoming worthy to be looked up to in turn.","For behind all imperialism is ultimately the imperialistic individual, just as behind all peace is ultimately the peaceful individual.","We may affirm, then, that the main drift of the later Renaissance was away from a humanism that favored a free expansion toward a humanism that was in the highest degree disciplinary and selective.","To harmonize the One with the Many, this is indeed a difficult adjustment, perhaps the most difficult of all, and so important, withal, that nations have perished from their failure to achieve it.","Tell him, on the contrary, that he needs, in the interest of his own happiness, to walk in the path of humility and self-control, and he will be indifferent, or even actively resentful.","The humanities need to be defended today against the encroachments of physical science, as they once needed to be against the encroachment of theology.","Act strenuously, would appear to be our faith, and right thinking will take care of itself.","The humanitarian lays stress almost solely upon breadth of knowledge and sympathy.","The true humanist maintains a just balance between sympathy and selection.","Very few of the early Italian humanists were really humane.","We must not, however, be like the leaders of the great romantic revolt who, in their eagerness to get rid of the husk of convention, disregarded also the humane aspiration.","The human mind, if it is to keep its sanity, must maintain the nicest balance between unity and plurality.","According to the new ethics, virtue is not restrictive but expansive, a sentiment and even an intoxication.","The papacy again, representing the traditional unity of European civilization, has also shown itself unable to limit effectively the push of nationalism.","The ultimate binding element in the medieval order was subordination to the divine will and its earthly representatives, notably the pope.","Robespierre, however, was not the type of leader finally destined to emerge from the Revolution.","Inasmuch as society cannot go on without discipline of some kind, men were constrained, in the absence of any other form of discipline, to turn to discipline of the military type.","A remarkable feature of the humanitarian movement, on both its sentimental and utilitarian sides, has been its preoccupation with the lot of the masses.","Perhaps as good a classification as any of the main types is that of the three lusts distinguished by traditional Christianity - the lust of knowledge, the lust of sensation, and the lust of power.","If quantitatively the American achievement is impressive, qualitatively it is somewhat less satisfying.","Furthermore, America suffers not only from a lack of standards, but also not infrequently from a confusion or an inversion of standards.","Since every man desires happiness, it is evidently no small matter whether he conceives of happiness in terms of work or of enjoyment.","A man needs to look, not down, but up to standards set so much above his ordinary self as to make him feel that he is himself spiritually the underdog.","The democratic idealist is prone to make light of the whole question of standards and leadership because of his unbounded faith in the plain people.","A democracy, the realistic observer is forced to conclude, is likely to be idealistic in its feelings about itself, but imperialistic about its practice.","The humanitarian would, of course, have us meddle in foreign affairs as part of his program of world service.","Yet Aristotle's excellence of substance, so far from being associated with the grand style, is associated with something that at times comes perilously near jargon.","To say that most of us today are purely expansive is only another way of saying that most of us continue to be more concerned with the quantity than with the quality of our democracy.","An American of the present day reading his Sunday newspaper in a state of lazy collapse is one of the most perfect symbols of the triumph of quantity over quality that the world has yet seen.","If a man went simply by what he saw, he might be tempted to affirm that the essence of democracy is melodrama.","If we are to have such a discipline we must have standards, and to get our standards under existing conditions we must have criticism."],"Irving Berlin":["Our attitudes control our lives. Attitudes are a secret power working twenty-four hours a day, for good or bad. It is of paramount importance that we know how to harness and control this great force.","Life is 10 percent what you make it, and 90 percent how you take it.","The toughest thing about success is that you've got to keep on being a success.","Everybody ought to have a lower East Side in their life.","Talent is only the starting point.","There's no business like show business.","I got lost but look what I found.","Never hate a song that's sold a half million copies.","After you get what you want you don't want it.","There is an element of truth in every idea that lasts long enough to be called corny.","You're not sick you're just in love.","There's no people like show people."],"Irving Fisher":["The rate of interest acts as a link between income-value and capital-value.","Stock prices have reached what looks like a permanently high plateau."],"Irving Harper":["At 93, I'm not looking forward to fame and fortune.","I don't have a complex mind.","With a computer, there are too many choices, and I always liked working within limits. You know, if you look at Mozart, who had this strict classical framework - an allegro, an andante, a scherzo and a finale - you see that within that formula, he got results he might never have gotten if he had all the options in the world.","I never sold any of my pieces. I had all the money I wanted. Then I would have lost my sculptures and just had more money."],"Irving Howe":["The knowledge that makes us cherish innocence makes innocence unattainable.","Imagination is not something apart and hermetic, not a way of leaving reality behind; it is a way of engaging reality."],"Irving Kirsch":["There are a variety of techniques to help people change the kind of thinking that leads them to become depressed. These techniques are called cognitive behavioral therapy.","The doctor-patient relationship is critical to the placebo effect.","Psychotherapy works, and some types of therapy have been shown to be much more effective than antidepressants over the long run.","Perhaps 10 percent of patients who are prescribed antidepressants are really benefiting from the drugs' active ingredients.","The big bulk of the response to antidepressants is the placebo response.","If doctors just spent more time with their patients so they felt more reassured, that might help.","Patients who trust their doctors and have a psychological expectation of getting better could trigger a reaction in their body.","Nocebos often cause a physical effect, but it's not a physically produced effect. What's the cause? In many cases, it's an unanswered question.","To someone who is not currently on anti-depressants, I would suggest trying other treatments first - for example, psychotherapy.","Antidepressants can have troubling side effects and are addictive for some people.","There seems little reason to prescribe anti-depressant medication to any but the most severely depressed patients.","Perhaps anti-depressants should be best reserved for the very extreme cases and, more importantly, for those who do not respond to alternative forms of interventions.","There seem to be many causes of depression. One cause is profound loss, grief. Economic hardship we know is linked to depression. We don't have a full picture.","The one thing we do know is that the chemical imbalance theory - the theory that people get depressed when they don't have enough serotonin in their brain - we know that that's wrong.","One problem I have with drug companies is that they don't make all their data public.","I do a lot of research on the placebo effect, not just in depression but in irritable bowel syndrome, pain, arthritis of the knee, migraine, asthma.","Anything that instills a sense of hope will at least temporarily help treat depression.","If you're taking an antidepressant, it's working, and you're not experiencing side effects, go on taking it. But if it's not working, or not working well enough, or if you have side effects you don't like, talk to your doctor about an alternative approach.","Depression comes back over time in about 90 percent of people on antidepressants. Studies show that relapses are far less common when people are treated with psychotherapy."],"Irving Kristol":["Democracy does not guarantee equality of conditions - it only guarantees equality of opportunity.","You have to know one big thing and stick with it. The leaders who had one very big idea and one very big commitment. This permitted them to create something. Those are the ones who leave a legacy.","People need religion. It's a vehicle for a moral tradition. A crucial role. Nothing can take its place."],"Irving Langmuir":["History proves abundantly that pure science, undertaken without regard to applications to human needs, is usually ultimately of direct benefit to mankind.","Science, almost from its beginnings, has been truly international in character. National prejudices disappear completely in the scientist's search for truth.","The scientist is motivated primarily by curiosity and a desire for truth.","Happy indeed is the scientist who not only has the pleasures which I have enumerated, but who also wins the recognition of fellow scientists and of the mankind which ultimately benefits from his endeavors.","And literature frequently rises to heights that make it international.","Medicine also disregards national boundaries.","This coupling together of science with international peace, is, I think, particularly significant.","To my mind, the most important aspect of the Nobel Awards is that they bring home to the masses of the peoples of all nations, a realization of their common interests. They carry to those who have no direct contact with science the international spirit."],"Irving Layton":["Conscience: self-esteem with a halo.","In Pierre Elliott Trudeau, Canada has at last produced a political leader worthy of assassination.","When you argue with your inferiors, you convince them of only one thing: they are as clever as you.","We love in another's soul whatever of ourselves we can deposit in it; the greater the deposit, the greater the love.","Idealist: a cynic in the making.","My neighbor doesn't want to be loved as much as he wants to be envied.","I am a genius who has written poems that will survive with the best of Shakespeare, Wordsworth and Keats.","Canadians look down on the United States and consider it Hell. They are right to do so. Canada is to the United States what, in Dante's scheme, Limbo is to Hell."],"Irving Paul Lazar":["I have no contracts with my clients; just a handshake is enough.","The whole point of having money, and working and making money, is to enjoy and spend it.","Sometimes I wake up in the morning and there's nothing doing, so I decide to make something happen by lunch.","In a deal, you give and take. You compromise. Then you grab the cash and catch the next train out of town.","I call myself a literary agent simply to distinguish myself from actors' agents.","I'm not a very religious man, but I'm proud to be a Jew."],"Irving Penn":["What I really try to do is photograph people at rest, in a state of serenity.","Sensitive people faced with the prospect of a camera portrait put on a face they think is the one they would like to show to the world... Every so often what lies behind the facade is rare and more wonderful than the subject knows or dares to believe.","Many photographers feel their client is the subject. My client is a woman in Kansas who reads Vogue. I'm trying to intrigue, stimulate, feed her. My responsibility is to the reader. The severe portrait that is not the greatest joy in the world to the subject may be enormously interesting to the reader.","I feed on art more than I ever do on photographs. I can admire photography, but I wouldn't go to it out of hunger.","I can get obsessed by anything if I look at it long enough. That's the curse of being a photographer.","I have always stood in awe of the camera. I recognize it for the instrument it is, part Stradivarius, part scalpel.","Photographing a cake can be art.","Using simple equipment and daylight alone is for me a pleasure and a replenishment.","I am a professional photographer because it is the best way I know to earn the money I require to take care of my wife and children.","The severe portrait that is not the greatest joy in the world to the subject may be enormously interesting to the reader.","Liberman said to me, 'I must cut back on the work you do for Vogue. The editors don't like it. They say the photographs burn on the page . After some years, I began to understand that what they wanted of me was simply a nice, sweet, clean-looking image of a lovely young woman.","Over the years I must have spent thousands of hours silently brushing on the liquid coatings, preparing each sheet in anticipation of reaching the perfect print.","A beautiful print is a thing in itself, not just a halfway house on the way to the page.","I've tried a few times to depart from what I know I can do, and I've failed. I've tried to work outside the studio, but it introduces too many variables that I can't control. I'm really quite narrow, you know."],"Irving R. Kaufman":["The judicial system is the most expensive machine ever invented for finding out what happened and what to do about it.","To the extent that the judicial profession becomes the daily routine of deciding cases on the most secure precedents and the narrowest grounds available, the judicial mind atrophies and its perspective shrinks.","The judge is forced for the most part to reach his audience through the medium of the press whose reporting of judicial decisions is all too often inaccurate and superficial.","The Supreme Court's only armor is the cloak of public trust; its sole ammunition, the collective hopes of our society.","Courtrooms contain every symbol of authority that a set designer could imagine. Everyone stands up when you come in. You wear a costume identifying you as, if not quite divine, someone special."],"Irving Ravetch":["You have another little drink, and I'll have another little drink, and maybe we can work up some real family feeling here.","Happens to everybody. Horses, dogs, men. Nobody gets out of life alive.","Well, I always say the law was meant to be interpreted in a lenient manner. And that's what I try to do, is sometimes I lean to one side of it, sometimes I lean to the other."],"Irving Stone":["My goal always is to tell a universal story, meaning it's about a person who has an idea, a vision, a dream, an ambition to make the world somewhat less chaotic.","I spend several years trying to get inside the brain and heart of my subjects, listening to the interior monologues in their letters, and when I have to bridge the chasms between the factual evidence, I try to make an intuitive leap through the eyes and motivation of the person I'm writing about.","My books are based 98 percent on documentary evidence.","The biographical novel is a true and documented story of one human being's journey across the face of the years, transmuted from the raw material of life into the delight and purity of an authentic art form.","The biographical novel sets out to document this truth, for character is plot, character development is action, and character fulfillment is resolution.","There's nothing romantic about my work... I don't believe in inspiration. I believe that you get to your desk, you stay there, you work, you think of nothing else. You write and you write, and in the end, you write something good.","Even if there is endless documentation, it would be impossible to know what a man thought inside his own mind... This is where the novelist's creative imagination has to take over.","In the biographical novel, there's only one person involved. I, the author, spend two to five years becoming the main character. I do that so by the time you get to the bottom of Page 2 or 3, you forget your name, where you live, your profession and the year it is. You become the main character of the book. You live the book.","I thought art was dead rabbits hanging by their feet on a wall. I went to Italy and saw all the religious paintings, and they didn't move me all that much. Then someone invited me to see this van Gogh exhibit at the Rosenberg Gallery in San Francisco.","I slept in van Gogh's bed. I worked in the room where he painted. I saw the place where he was cared for when he cut off his ear. I lived in the jail cell where he stayed. And I looked out the window. You remember that picture of the cornfields through the bars? That was what I saw.","Strange story about Degas. He hated women, didn't want to be with them. Yet he spent much of his life painting them. He had seen his father maltreat his mother, must have had a deep fear that he'd do the same thing.","I came down successfully through Picasso and Braque, down through Pollock, I guess, but I began to stop at Franz Kline and the Abstractionists. I like their design, brilliant design, marvelous color layers. But I don't find any human content there. I'm from an old school, and painting has to have human content for me."],"Irving Thalberg":["The movie medium will eventually take its place as art because there is no other medium of interest to so many people.","Credit you give yourself is not worth having.","A story never looks as good as when the other fellow buys it.","Novelty is always welcome but talking pictures are just a fad.","Forget it, Louis, no Civil War picture ever made a nickel."],"Irving Wallace":["To be one's self, and unafraid whether right or wrong, is more admirable than the easy cowardice of surrender to conformity.","Every man can transform the world from one of monotony and drabness to one of excitement and adventure."],"Irwin Corey":["If we don't change direction soon, we'll end up where we're going.","Marriage is like a bank account. You put it in, you take it out, you lose interest.","When your IQ rises to 28, sell."],"Irwin Edman":["Life is always at some turning point.","The standardized American is largely a myth created not least by Americans themselves.","It is a myth, not a mandate, a fable not a logic, and symbol rather than a reason by which men are moved."],"Irwin M. Jacobs":["While I was at Cornell in engineering, I was an engineering co-op student, and that turned out to be very valuable because we'd go out every other term to work in industry and have that close association with industry.","At Linkabit, we put little effort and energy into patenting things.","When we began Qualcomm, it had become quite clear that it was very important to patent new ideas.","We try to preach innovation. We provide resources; we invite speakers in from universities to talk about new ideas."],"Irwin Redlener":["Having insurance doesn't guarantee good health outcomes, but it is a critical factor.","There has been a transition from a nuclear-annihilation scenario to an isolated-terrorist-nuclear-bomb scenario. But we're still locked into a mind-set that nuclear war would be so overwhelming that any kind of preparedness would be futile.","Immigrant children are highly vulnerable. Their level of disadvantage and fragility has consistently grown due to factors outside their control.","The risks are far greater to your child of not getting immunized than any kind of speculative potential relationship between the vaccine and the development of autism.","Medicaid and the Child Health Insurance Program are the two most important safety net programs for children.","Police officers and firemen are so visible in their daily work, there's no mistaking they're there - and that presence makes people feel secure.","Poverty-fighting programs are not handouts - they are investments.","Fallout shelters are like bell-bottoms. They've gone in and out of favor.","Even the best community organizations and faith-based initiatives and the extraordinary charity of Americans across the country can't carry the brunt of eliminating poverty.","The reality is that it's harder to recruit pediatric subspecialists if you're not recruiting them for a children's hospital.","Kids get a lot of lip service in disaster planning, but they tend to get far fewer resources than they need. The mantra of 'children are our most valuable resource' is almost never matched by actual funding.","There's only so much academic disruption that a young child can deal with before he just can't catch up.","There isn't a single American city, in my estimation, that has sufficient plans for a nuclear terrorist event.","If a severe pandemic materializes, all of society could pay a heavy price for decades of failing to create a rational system of health care that works for all of us.","Disasters like Oklahoma City and 9/11 were time-limited. The children who were affected psychologically could go to a place of normalcy.","If we ensure access to health care and 'best practice' asthma treatment for children, especially those at high risk, there is the potential to save the health care system billions of dollars.","Many low-income children face chronic stress from nutritional deprivation or persistent violence at home or in the community. By addressing their medical, emotional and developmental needs through a comprehensive clinical care model, we can lower their risk of developing long-term physical and mental health issues.","The problem with most children's hospitals is that they are passive. They are high quality. They are filled with the best doctors. But their function is to wait until kids get sick and get referred in.","Hospitals are about healing.","Very large scale disasters, especially those that have occurred in the developing world, have very long recovery periods.","The larger the disaster, the more necessary it is to have the government as the principal driver of recovery.","Every single administration in American political history has put cronies and pals and donors into political positions. But normally those people become the ambassador to Liechtenstein or the deputy undersecretary of commerce.","No organization should be allowed near disaster unless they are willing to cooperate with some level of established leadership.","From a population point of view, it's actually very important that as few people as possible get the flu. People getting the flu is not a private matter. The risk for healthy people is really about your friends and neighbors and fellow travelers.","There are several very good websites which describe the details of preparedness planning for citizens.","The best way to get a sense of what kinds of emergencies might present themselves in your community is by contacting local chapters of the American Red Cross or offices of emergency management in the region or state. Most large cities will have their own offices of emergency management.","Every school should have well-rehearsed emergency response protocols covering a variety of possible scenarios, from fire to armed intruders. Schools should have good lines of communications with local emergency response officials and practice those relationships in drills and special exercises.","Americans do not have a good track record when it comes to preparing for disasters, unless they see a clear possibility of personally being in harms way.","There's detailed information on how to assemble a nuclear weapon from parts. There's books about how to build a nuclear bomb.","Seven million ship cargo containers come into the United States every year. Five to seven percent only are inspected - five to seven percent.","Nuclear terrorism is possible - it may be probable - but is survivable.","President Obama was deeply and clearly affected by the Sandy Hook disaster.","When children are hungry, sleepy from a night spent fighting untreated asthma, or hobbled by symptoms of undiagnosed illnesses, they are less likely to do well in school.","Poverty leads to hardship and failure."],"Irwin Rose":["We left my birthplace, Brooklyn, New York, in 1939 when I was 13. I enjoyed the ethnic variety and the interesting students in my public school, P.S. 134. The kids in my neighborhood were only competitive in games, although unfriendly gangs tended to define the limits of our neighborhood.","Initially, I thought problems on how the brain works to be the most interesting. But it was necessary to be practical and concentrate on less obscure matters when I entered Washington State College. Besides, there were no courses given in neurobiology.","My Ph.D. thesis problem was to determine if the DNA content of rat tissues increased if there was B12 in the diet. This problem was suggested by my adviser based on the observation that thymine could replace vitamin B12 in a lactobacillus.","Looking back on my 50-year eclectic journey in research, I am grateful that it has gone as well as it has, although still not clever enough to open the black box of enzyme structure.","My interest in protein breakdown as a research problem began in l955 at about the time I joined the Biochemistry Department of Yale University. It was known that proteins break down intracellularly in the mature animal.","Enzymologists usually study the initial rates of reactions measuring product formation as a function of substrate concentration or other variable. Cell biologists are more likely to want to know the effect of a change on the steady state behavior of a complex system.","We moved from the East coast to the town of Spokane, Washington, when I was about 13 years old, and I did not adapt very well to the, to the style of the place, and I spent most of my time in the public library.","I floated around in the department of biochemistry and learned some interesting things, and then I began to... I never wanted to work with a mentor because I always wanted to have my own reputation and be free to do what I wanted to do. So I worked with the weakest people in the department. Don't make that public.","I don't have any hobbies. You know, I'm very embarrassed when people ask me what are my hobbies; I don't have any hobbies. I mean, it's just enough to keep up with the things I'm trying to solve."],"Irwin Shaw":["I reach my readers regardless of what the critics have written.","A writer is a human being. He has to live with a sense of honor.","A writer has to live with a sense of honor.","All writers are the same - they forget a thousand good reviews and remember one bad one.","My views naturally have mellowed. Most of the critics have been more or less nice to me.","In America, we have the feeling of the doomed young artist. Fitzgerald was the great example of that.","I never drink while I'm working, but after a few glasses I get ideas that would never have occurred to me dead sober.","An absolutely necessary part of a writer's equipment, almost as necessary as talent, is the ability to stand up under punishment, both the punishment the world hands out and the punishment he inflicts upon himself.","Every novelist has a different purpose - and often several purposes which might even be contradictory.","I am forced to say that I have many fiercer critics than myself.","It's those damn critics again.","Posterity makes the judgments. There are going to be a lot of surprises in store for everybody.","Special-interest magazines are dangerous places for writers to start out in because the writing quickly falls into a routine and people are likely to find themselves artistically exhausted when they want to work on something of their own.","The romantic idea is that everybody around a writer must suffer for his talent. I think a writer is a citizen of humanity, part of his nation, part of his family. He may have to make some compromises.","When I started out in the early 1930s, there were a great many magazines that published short stories. Unfortunately, the short-story market has dwindled to almost nothing.","Writers of fiction, when they begin, are more likely to try the short form.","Writing for the theater, you find yourself living a nocturnal life.","You have to expect the raps when you have achieved popularity as a writer.","You must avoid giving hostages to fortune, like getting an expensive wife, an expensive house, and a style of living that never lets you aford the time to take the chance to write what you wish.","If you're young enough, any kind of writing you do for a short period of time is a marvelous apprenticeship.","My attitudes have changed, but somebody would have to read all my books to find out how they have.","I imagine that my characters have become much more complicated than when I first began, which would be normal.","I'm not as hopeful as I was when I was young.","At the height of the McCarthy period, writers were being hounded.","Kennedy was a man who liked writers and even I got invited to the White House.","Ernest Hemingway did a great deal toward making the writer an acceptable public figure; obviously, he was no sissy.","I don't think that the writer is regarded as a freak by Americans.","In Europe, a writer is supposed to improve up until he's about 75.","Isaac Singer was born in Poland and doesn't write in English. Still, he's an American.","People who light up like Roman candles come down in the dark very quickly.","Curiously, the United States is full of writers who have one big work in their life and that's all.","The great writers just kept bringing them out. They didn't care if they repeated themselves.","I've gone on the wagon, but my body doesn't believe it.","I never show anything to anybody until I've finished it.","The writer works in a lonely way.","In a novel, it's hard to keep track of everybody.","The last paragraph, in which you tell what the story is about, is almost always best left out.","My favorite short-story writer is John Cheever.","A good editor understands what you're talking and writing about and doesn't meddle too much.","I haven't stuck to any formula. Most great writers stick to the same style, but I wanted to be more various.","In the theater, characters have to cut the umbilical cord from the writer and talk in their own voices.","Writing is finally play, and there's no reason why you should get paid for playing.","No writer need feel sorry for himself if he writes and enjoys it, even if he doesn't get paid.","Writing is like a contact sport, like football. You can get hurt, but you enjoy it.","I cringe when critics say I'm a master of the popular novel.

There's rap and there's music.","People refer to me as 'that 'Love Boat' man.'","I find great beauty in songs with a creative interpretation, but most people generally don't get that, and go for the simple songs, but I prefer something a bit more complicated, which is more meaningful to the creator.","Because I'm shy and a bit quiet, I think people assume I'm an elegant person.","I particularly like Hershey's chocolate - the kind which has almonds in it.","I was always one of those fortunate people who never wanted to be anything other than a singer and an actor. Most people know me as a singer, but I am also an actor.","My grandfather was from Aberdare. He was a coal miner who emigrated and then continued mining in Pennsylvania.","I was born into a world where a lot of people who came to the house were performers.","I'm not even allowed to sing in the shower at home. Too loud.","If someone had told me when I was a kid I'd get an ovation from Frank Sinatra! One time, I did a song called 'I Am A Singer', but I rewrote the words for Frank. I was in tears and, when he got up, so was he."],"Irwin Winkler":["I found 'Celebrity Gangster' intense, dramatic, a real page turner.","Even some of us who make movies underestimate their influence abroad. American movies sell American culture. Foreigners want to see American movies. But that's also why so many foreign governments and groups object to them.","This is certainly not to excuse the violence that exists on TV and films and on the Internet. But the truth is that wherever you go in Europe, there are American films and TV shows that are just as popular as at home. And you don't have that sense of violence in any other place other than America.","We all know we have a prescribed amount of time on Earth. We just don't know how much.","The thing that's strange about Frank Vincent is that actors of his quality are usually big stars.","I just think there's a general interest in the world of computers.","I remember when 'The Right Stuff' opened in Hollywood. I got dressed that morning and drove my car down to the theatre that it was playing on, thinking that there would be mobs of people outside. When I looked, there was nobody there.","I have an Oscar on my mantel.","If you look at successful studios, they're the ones with stabilized management.","Show me a Scorsese film, and I'll show you a movie where he's taken risks. It's just his nature. He's an artist, and artists take risks. He always does what he believes in.","Many of the best films made about war have come out after the wars have ended. People need a period of time to reflect on them.","The day I make movies that Rupert Murdoch likes and admires is the day I'll throw in the towel, because he's got no taste.","Believe me, it would be a long, long, cold day before I decide to warm up next to Rupert Murdoch.","It wasn't easy getting 'GoodFellas' started.","Boxing is one of the few sports that is one on one.","For the good producer, raising capital is about the last thing to worry about. If you're good, the money comes very easily.","Every film I do, I'm involved with from the very conception of the project.","Most of the producers don't know what they do. The misconception of the producers' function is really not a misconception. Most producers don't do a very good job.","I'm just trying to tell a nice story. Whether you're a writer or a producer, all you want to do is tell a good yarn.","Usually when you have a sequel, the character always stays the same and that's true basically of 'Rocky III,' 'IV' and 'V.' He didn't really change.","When James Bond gets old, you get rid of him and bring a new James Bond in.","More money has been lost trying to imitate 'Rocky' than 'Rocky' has made.","When studios start telling me why a particular film project won't work, I remember 'Rocky.' I remember that the biggest success Bob Chartoff and I have had was a film nobody wanted to make.","No one wants to hear from the producer. He's the guy by the pool with a cigar in his mouth and a couple of lovelies on his arm. But when you're a director, they want to hear what you have to say about everything - the war, the world.","As a producer, the most important call you can get is on Saturday morning, when the Friday-night grosses come in. As a director, you want your film to be successful. But your outlook is a bit different. You become very conscious of the reviews.","If I'm going to produce something, it's going to be with somebody I think is special. Once I go beyond a handful of directors, like Scorsese, there are very few I want to work with.","I am one of the graduates of the William Morris famous, famous mail room from the '60s.","I really woke up one morning and said, you know, 'I haven't seen a good film about the American Revolution. And all the ones I have seen haven't been successful, but I'm going to make a successful one.' Well, I wasn't able to do that."],"Isaac Asimov":["People who think they know everything are a great annoyance to those of us who do.","Life is pleasant. Death is peaceful. It's the transition that's troublesome.","There is a cult of ignorance in the United States, and there has always been. The strain of anti-intellectualism has been a constant thread winding its way through our political and cultural life, nurtured by the false notion that democracy means that my ignorance is just as good as your knowledge.","Violence is the last refuge of the incompetent.","Writing, to me, is simply thinking through my fingers.","The true delight is in the finding out rather than in the knowing.","No sensible decision can be made any longer without taking into account not only the world as it is, but the world as it will be.","It is change, continuing change, inevitable change, that is the dominant factor in society today. No sensible decision can be made any longer without taking into account not only the world as it is, but the world as it will be.","Never let your sense of morals get in the way of doing what's right.","I do not fear computers. I fear the lack of them.","The most exciting phrase to hear in science, the one that heralds new discoveries, is not 'Eureka!' but 'That's funny...'","Individual science fiction stories may seem as trivial as ever to the blinder critics and philosophers of today - but the core of science fiction, its essence has become crucial to our salvation if we are to be saved at all.","Self-education is, I firmly believe, the only kind of education there is.","Part of the inhumanity of the computer is that, once it is competently programmed and working smoothly, it is completely honest.","Humanity has the stars in its future, and that future is too important to be lost under the burden of juvenile folly and ignorant superstition.","Science fiction writers foresee the inevitable, and although problems and catastrophes may be inevitable, solutions are not.","I am not a speed reader. I am a speed understander.","A subtle thought that is in error may yet give rise to fruitful inquiry that can establish truths of great value.","And above all things, never think that you're not good enough yourself. A man should never think that. My belief is that in life people will take you at your own reckoning.","There is a single light of science, and to brighten it anywhere is to brighten it everywhere.","The saddest aspect of life right now is that science gathers knowledge faster than society gathers wisdom.","If my doctor told me I had only six minutes to live, I wouldn't brood. I'd type a little faster.","To surrender to ignorance and call it God has always been premature, and it remains premature today.","It pays to be obvious, especially if you have a reputation for subtlety.","I don't expect to live forever, but I do intend to hang on as long as possible.","I write for the same reason I breathe - because if I didn't, I would die.","All sorts of computer errors are now turning up. You'd be surprised to know the number of doctors who claim they are treating pregnant men.","To insult someone we call him 'bestial. For deliberate cruelty and nature, 'human' might be the greater insult.","If knowledge can create problems, it is not through ignorance that we can solve them.","I don't believe in an afterlife, so I don't have to spend my whole life fearing hell, or fearing heaven even more. For whatever the tortures of hell, I think the boredom of heaven would be even worse.","Suppose that we are wise enough to learn and know - and yet not wise enough to control our learning and knowledge, so that we use it to destroy ourselves? Even if that is so, knowledge remains better than ignorance.","When I read about the way in which library funds are being cut and cut, I can only think that American society has found one more way to destroy itself.","Creationists make it sound as though a 'theory' is something you dreamt up after being drunk all night.","It takes more than capital to swing business.

It is not only the living who are killed in war.","He had read much, if one considers his long life; but his contemplation was much more than his reading. He was wont to say that if he had read as much as other men he should have known no more than other men.","Meanwhile, fears of universal disaster sank to an all time low over the world.","Dalton's records, carefully preserved for a century, were destroyed during the World War II bombing of Manchester.

They do not believe in any reward for charity, therefore they will part with nothing.","Even private persons in due season, with discretion and temper, may reprove others, whom they observe to commit sin, or follow bad courses, out of charitable design, and with hope to reclaim them.","Facetiousness is allowable when it is the most proper instrument of exposing things apparently base and vile to due contempt.","If men are wont to play with swearing anywhere, can we expect they should be serious and strict therein at the bar or in the church.","Let us consider that swearing is a sin of all others peculiarly clamorous, and provocative of Divine judgment.","No man speaketh, or should speak, of his prince, that which he hath not weighed whether it will consist with that veneration which should be preserved inviolate to him.","That justice should be administered between men, it is necessary that testimonies of fact be alleged; and that witnesses should apprehend themselves greatly obliged to discover the truth, according to their conscience, in dark and doubtful cases.","Whence it is somewhat strange that any men from so mean and silly a practice should expect commendation, or that any should afford regard thereto; the which it is so far from meriting, that indeed contempt and abhorrence are due to it."],"Isaac Bashevis Singer":["Our knowledge is a little island in a great ocean of nonknowledge.","Kindness, I've discovered, is everything in life.","What nature delivers to us is never stale. Because what nature creates has eternity in it.","I did not become a vegetarian for my health, I did it for the health of the chickens.","A good writer is basically a story teller, not a scholar or a redeemer of mankind.","There will be no justice as long as man will stand with a knife or with a gun and destroy those who are weaker than he is.","The analysis of character is the highest human entertainment.","People often say that humans have always eaten animals, as if this is a justification for continuing the practice. According to this logic, we should not try to prevent people from murdering other people, since this has also been done since the earliest of times.","If you keep on saying things are going to be bad, you have a good chance of being a prophet.","Every creator painfully experiences the chasm between his inner vision and its ultimate expression.","There is great treasure there behind our skull and this is true about all of us. This little treasure has great, great powers, and I would say we only have learnt a very, very small part of what it can do.","For those who are willing to make an effort, great miracles and wonderful treasures are in store.","We must believe in free will, we have no choice.","The greatness of art is not to find what is common but what is unique.","If Moses had been paid newspaper rates for the Ten Commandments, he might have written the Two Thousand Commandments.","The New England conscience doesn't keep you from doing what you shouldn't - it just keeps you from enjoying it.","The very essence of literature is the war between emotion and intellect, between life and death. When literature becomes too intellectual - when it begins to ignore the passions, the emotions - it becomes sterile, silly, and actually without substance.","When you betray somebody else, you also betray yourself.","A story to me means a plot where there is some surprise. Because that is how life is - full of surprises.","We have to believe in free-will. We've got no choice.","When I was a little boy, they called me a liar, but now that I am grown up, they call me a writer.","The waste basket is the writer's best friend.","Life is God's novel. Let him write it.","I am thankful, of course, for the prize and thankful to God for each story, each idea, each word, each day.","We write not only for children but also for their parents. They, too, are serious children.","Originality is not seen in single words or even in sentences. Originality is the sum total of a man's thinking or his writing.","The second half of the twentieth century is a complete flop.","If you keep saying things are going to be bad, you have a good chance of being a prophet.","Doubt is part of all religion. All the religious thinkers were doubters.","We know what a person thinks not when he tells us what he thinks, but by his actions.","Sometimes love is stronger than a man's convictions."],"Isaac Brock":["Even when I was a kid, I always showed up late for school every day. It got to the point where they had my late slips filled for every day of the school year in advance, so all they had to do was fill in what time I got there.","I didn't mean to live in Portland. It was kind of an accident - I mean, the equivalent of my car breaking down there and me being like, 'Well... I guess this is what I'm doing. I just can't find a better alternate.'","I don't much like things to go by somebody's name, like the 'Bob Jones Group Jam Band.'","Most of the best music in American history was made by people with no options.","The guy who kind of identified as my dad was my dad's brother, who was the second person my mom married.","'Float On' was a fine song, but I was still writing the lyrics on the last day we were working on it and deciding if it was something we wanted to put on the record.","I'm a huge Cure fan. I love the Cure. The scales being tipped to when they weren't on a major label compared to when they were seems pretty meaningless. I had the good fortune of having them go before me and seeing their careers, musically at least, lose something. Like a novel written by a dead hand.","I like Modest Mouse. I'm our biggest fan. And enemy. I won't waste people's time by putting out a Modest Mouse record just because. That's fair, right?","As frustrating as it is to not have a record come out, I have to make sure that it's worth putting out. I have to be trying to say something, for one. I have to not oversell what I'm trying to say. I can't 'Bono' it.","I don't think I ever write songs involving politics, because they get dated way too quick. Any view you have can usually be made into something more general, and that can stand throughout time.","I made a point when I made the Ugly Casanova record to not write a song and then say, 'This is a Modest Mouse song' or 'This is an Ugly Casanova song.' The people who were open to it not being a Modest Mouse record liked it.","When I do write, it happens really easily. I'll just kind of sing along to whatever I'm playing, then find a line to build off of, then sit down and write. When I do write, I take care of business!","If I find myself just not feeling like writing songs anymore, I think I'll drop it. There's enough bad, insincere music out there. I don't need to contribute to that.","Portland hardly got to have an identity before that identity became a joke - I live in a joke. Seattle at least got to wear out its identity before it became a joke.","If I start working on something, I get a little too driven."],"Isaac D'Israeli":["The wisdom of the wise, and the experience of ages, may be preserved by quotation.","It is a wretched taste to be gratified with mediocrity when the excellent lies before us.","The wise make proverbs, and fools repeat them.","Enthusiasm is that secret and harmonious spirit which hovers over the production of genius.","To think, and to feel, constitute the two grand divisions of men of genius - the men of reasoning and the men of imagination.","The act of contemplation then creates the thing created.","The defects of great men are the consolation of the dunces.","After all, it is style alone by which posterity will judge of a great work, for an author can have nothing truly his own but his style.","Quotations, like much better things, has its abuses.","Fortune has rarely condescended to be the companion of genius.","All is extremely genteel; and there is almost as much repose as in the golden saloons of the contiguous palaces. At any rate, if there be as much vice, there is as little crime.","Certain it is that their power increased always in an exact proportion to the weakness of the Caliphate, and, without doubt, in some of the most distracted periods of the Arabian rule, the Hebrew Princes rose into some degree of local and temporary importance.","Their chief residence was Bagdad, where they remained until the eleventh century, an age fatal in Oriental history, from the disasters of which the Princes of the Captivity were not exempt.","The most noble criticism is that in which the critic is not the antagonist so much as the rival of the author.","Those who do not read criticism will rarely merit to be criticised.","The Self-Educated are marked by stubborn peculiarities.","Happy the man when he has not the defects of his qualities.","Many men of genius must arise before a particular man of genius can appear.","The golden hour of invention must terminate like other hours, and when the man of genius returns to the cares, the duties, the vexations, and the amusements of life, his companions behold him as one of themselves - the creature of habits and infirmities.","Time the great destroyer of other men's happiness, only enlarges the patrimony of literature to its possessor.","Literature is an avenue to glory, ever open for those ingenious men who are deprived of honours or of wealth.","The delight of opening a new pursuit, or a new course of reading, imparts the vivacity and novelty of youth even to old age."],"Isaac Goldberg":["Diplomacy is to do and say the nastiest things in the nicest way.","There is that smaller world which is the stage, and that larger stage which is the world."],"Isaac Hanson":["Everybody has their ups and downs, and that's what makes you tougher.","It is a growing process. You can't just like beer. You have to start somewhere and learn the different flavors.","Working with Yahoo! allows us to give our fans a chance to listen to our songs, check out the video, purchase our new album, win tickets to our show, and chat with us all in one place.","I've got angels watching out for me.","But anyone who knows anything about the music industry knows it's not only about the music.","Being an entrepreneur means being a creative businessperson.","Eventually, the bad boy image affects fans' willingness to show up.","I feel like, in some level, in our biggest moments of success we were always the underdog.","As an artist or musician, you want to be remembered for the music you make.","Word of mouth is way more important than millions of dollars spent marketing.","Everybody feels up sometimes, they feel down sometimes, sometimes they feel sideways, sometimes they feel weird. And the beauty of music is you can express all those different feelings in all the different songs you write. And hopefully, people can identify with those.","Everybody has their demons; everyone has their challenges.","One of the things I want to do as an artist is to connect generations.","People my age don't always know where their music comes from.","Actually, I don't think there's anyone that represents the artists, except the artists themselves.","Christmas albums are not something you do frequently.","There are very few people who have done more than one Christmas album.","I enjoyed making this album a lot because of the knowledge we acquired over the last 3 years.","There are so many lovely cities around the U.S., around the world, that it's almost impossible to pick one.","Yes it was we, are a few years back parted from our record company and took the album that we were making with them and released it independently in the United States had a number one Independent debut in the United States.","I think downloading is both saving and killing the music industry at the same time.","I'm doing what I do for the right reasons. I love the music that I make.","We've sold over 100,000 records so far, and we're an independent label.","Generally, I end up being the one thrown against the wall, because Zach is the drummer. He's stronger than me.","What we do every night is we change out the set list as much as we can to make sure that (fans can) go home and tell their friends they experienced something unique and cool.","Taylor being married and so on, that does evolve the dynamic on the road.","We have a good time and try not to kill each other.","We didn't want our kids raised in a place plagued by smog and plastic surgery.","I'm a proud family man.","Oklahoma is very entrepreneurial.","I want my kids to know that what I do is work. It's fun, it's a great job, but it's work.","Death is always a reality, and life is incredibly short.","The crowds in Milwaukee are awesome.","Brick-and-mortar at the end of the day matters because viral is great, but it comes and goes as fast.","I think Hugh Laurie is awesome. You just want to loathe that guy in 'House' because he is not a friendly person, but somehow or another, he is profoundly charming.","We've always believed in our music.","We said from the very beginning that we're in this for the long haul.","We've done enough - and made enough mistakes - to pretty well know how to guide our careers ourselves.","No matter what, I will always hope for that day when I look around and can say, 'Oh yeah, I wrote a song that touched me emotionally the way that a song like 'She's Got A Way,' by Billy Joel did.'","I just want to write a great lyric and write a great song, and everything else is icing on the cake.","If our kids want to do music, they are going to have to have a hard row to hoe just like any other band under the sun, and they're going to have to want it more than anyone else.","Our first manager really pushed that we not sell our publishing rights, which is one of the earliest things an artist will do: They'll sell in order to get a cash advance.","The most creative person is not the person who can come up with the best idea; it's the one who can take that group of things on the table and assemble them in the greatest multiple of unique ways.","The premise of anything you do - whether it's writing a song or any business - is ultimately that it hinges heavily on your belief in the thing that you're doing and promoting and selling. It's a reflection of who you are in a very deep way.","Hanson will be associated with 'MMMBop' and long blonde hair in the same way the Beatles are associated with mop tops and suits.","In some ways, Australian fans are more dedicated and more enthusiastic than some of our most loyal fans in the U.S.","We legitimately walked into 'Anthem' head-on, not paying enough attention to internal band tension.","'Anthem' was the record that almost didn't get made for a completely different reason than 'Underneath.'","'MMMbop' ultimately is about trying to see the positive in the negative, trying to see the positive relationships you'll have the in the face of challenge and strife.","Luckily, I'm in a band with two other guys who really pull their own weight and have the skills and abilities to compensate for my weaknesses.","The artist-audience relationship is the most valuable thing, and anything you can do to fuel the long-term potential of that relationship is of value to you.","Careers are like roller coasters. You go up, you go down, and you spin yourself around.","Hanson plays music that is very much a part of everything.","Sometimes a chord on a guitar will somehow spur some thought in your head, and you will write a song about it.","People often ask us if we had direct influences. Honestly, just a lot of different music - not necessarily individual people. We listen to anything from Bob Dylan to Massive Attack to Aerosmith to En Vogue. We very much enjoy all that music.","Don't misunderstand good manners for passivity.","Every book has to start with a first chapter, and I think that 'Middle of Nowhere,' 'Mmmbop' and 'Where Is the Love' are good places to start for us. I don't think it's a bad place.","It's really crazy to be 36 years old and to have been doing something for 25 years.","I don't get sick of 'MMMBop' in any way shape or form, and I don't know why I would.","I think there are a variety of misconceptions that go along with what 'MMMBop' and our band has been perceived as from the beginning, but I have absolutely no qualms whatsoever about playing 'MMMBop.'","Hanson is not the pop band that a lot of people think we are. I think we're a lot more rooted in a lot of music history... we're songwriters, we're singers, we're players first. We're not entertainers, we're not celebrities, and frankly, we don't really want to be.","Our parents were really, really grounded people but also really ambitious people, meaning they saw our ambition and were willing to help us chase it.","My parents were never condescending to us. They treated us like adults from a very young age.","I am continually pleasantly surprised by how many people are showing up at shows and are younger than our first record.","Texas is a pretty free state.","There's no problem with fans and bands. There's a problem with the economics of the outside disruption of the industry.","'MMMBop' took about a year to actually get completed. The chorus idea had really been around for a long time, and then we built the song around it.","You just have to be yourself and make music you feel from your gut, and hopefully, your audience will respond.","I was totally offended when people said we were like *Nsync. I've got nothing against them. I know those guys. But comparing us was lame. It was apples and oranges.","What's really important is that all we ever were was a band. And all we ever wanted to be was a band.","In a phrase: I always hope it keeps getting better.","When we show up in a city, we ask, 'Where's the best restaurant? What's the best beer?' You start doing that, and you get exposed to a lot of great stuff.","As much as we were very proud of being a pop band, I know we never felt like we fit into that category.","We felt like, first and foremost, we were songwriters.","I joke that we're not dissimilar to a rock band in the '70s.","The only way that you can ever continue to have a career and have success and have hits is if you are honest to yourself in the same way that you were in the beginning.","At some point, you decide to take something you really like and turn it into a business you love.","There are some seminal things that happened in the '70s for me: Billy Joel and Jackson 5.","Yes, our band will change and evolve, but we want to establish the reality of what this band truly sounds like.","We have always adapted ourselves to the songs instead of vice versa.","When we were younger, we sang at the dinner table. We started doing two part harmony, then three part, and then we added back up tapes and instruments.","Ultimately, our goal was to be a band and be recognized for our songs and making records. And I think that has been the case.","We can do things that are very, very simple to us that can have a huge impact on others.","I have a hard time with musicians who act like pricks because it just makes me mad. I just sit there and I go, 'You know what, dude, no matter whether you're in a band just surviving or you're in a bus playing stadiums, one way or another, you're still among the rare breed of people that are actually getting paid to do it.'","It's hard to complain when you say, 'We're gonna go to the clip where Helen Hunt and Will Ferrell are on 'Saturday Night Live' making fun of your song.'","We've always been proud of what we've done.","For better or worse, we have evolved for sure, but we've also maintained a certain core about who we are, which is we were raised on late '50s and early '60s rock n' roll and R&B, and you can always hear that throughout. And that's just always been who we were. As much as we've evolved, that's stayed the same.","You can call Hanson a whole lot of things, but hip-hop isn't one of them.","A lot of potential scenarios create challenges. It's all about how you grew up, values instilled in you.","Kids will ask us 'How do you become famous?' It's the wrong question. Focus on the craft, not on the fame.","I'm a bit of a hothead in certain circumstances, but you've got to temper it because your fans are there, and they've paid good money to see a show.","Getting to make the music, and having a good time doing it, is the most important thing to us.","There are a lot of dynamics and a lot of politics that go into records and getting played on the radio.","Most of our shows are about two and a half hours long.","There needs to be leadership in the heartland of America.","We pushed our first record, 'Boomerang,' to different labels, but it was hard for them to see though the 'white guys singing R&B' thing.","We're Midwestern guys who grew up listening to soul music.","There's something extraordinary about selling millions and millions of albums.","Our songs all carry the same way.","We're just going to be ourselves, and we're just going to cross our fingers and hope that people like it. Because that's all you can do."],"Isaac Hayes":["If you enjoy the fragrance of a rose, you must accept the thorns which it bears.","There's always hurdles. So I just keep moving, just constantly redefining myself. That's how you stay in the race.","Religious beliefs are sacred to people, and at all times should be respected and honoured.","Know the business, learn the business, own something.","There is a place in this world for satire, but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry towards religious beliefs of others begins.","I used to stand in front of the mic and cry.","There's something about live players that you cannot get with machines: With live musicians, you can strike a groove, you can feed off each other... And, even though somebody might make a slight mistake, it's all real!","I was a pop freak. I love music. Of course, I knew soul because I grew up in it. Writing it and everything. I love soul. But I love a tune that has some meat in it. Something I could hang my hat on. Because music is universal. Therefore, I felt no boundaries.","Self-expression is always a right, but it's still not there to be abused.","Have you ever wondered why young people take to music like fish to water? Maybe it's because music is fun. Plan and simple. It opens up their minds to dream great dreams about where they can go and what they can do when they get older.","A certain administration which I won't call by name took the arts out of the schools, and that left the brothers out on the street with nothing, so they went to the turntables and started rhyming. Then they had a way to express themselves, and that's the birth of hip-hop.","The rappers have gone in and created a lot of hit music based upon my influence. And they'll tell you if you ask.","Just, you know, you can't put bread in a cold oven. You know, you've got to take your time. You've got to heat it up. So that's what, that's what I like to do with my music. I like to build it, and build it into a maddening, exciting crescendo.","I first heard African drum rhythms and chants at the movies. Then, when I had the opportunity to go to Africa and visit the villages, I heard the real, raw, true rhythms and realised the origins of the old Negro spirituals I grew up with in the South.","Guys in slavery sang praises to the Lord to deliver them from bondage.","I influence people, hopefully on the positive side.","I'd always loved strings. When I was in high school and saw strings playing on stage, an orchestra or a symphony, all those bows moving at the same time... wow.","I love music.","I think the kids today need to hear more about morals and values.","All the time I was writing hit songs with my partner David Porter, I always had the yen to perform. Sure did. And when the opportunity came, I took it. The first album, 'Presenting Isaac Hayes,' didn't do so hot, but it was like a prelude for what was to come.","I've been around a long time, and when I was at the top of the hill, I was very ahead of my time! Evidence of that is that my music is still current today - you know, rappers sample it all the time. So, rather than compromise my artistic integrity, I concentrated on movies.","Elvis was a giant and influenced everyone in the business."],"Isaac Hempstead Wright":["Every day that you're on set is a new day to learn something. Every time you're there, there's something new that you'll notice or something that you'll miss, and you think of something new that you can do.","The thing about 'Game of Thrones' is it doesn't pin too much of a focus on magic. It kind of paints it in the same way that mystical things are portrayed in our world, because you don't walk about Westeros and see wizards with staffs or magical wands. All the characters don't really believe in it. It's this mysterious hidden vein to Westeros.","I really want to be a villain.","I love 'Sherlock.' I love 'Modern Family.'","One of my first days shooting on 'Game of Thrones' was possibly the coldest day I've ever experienced in my life, and that sticks out especially because I'd never, ever done anything before.","'Game of Thrones' isn't all about magic - it's way more about political scheming and family tensions - but to be a part of this exclusive magic club is actually really cool.","It wasn't like I ever said, 'I want to be an actor.' I was in the right place at the right time. I went to a local drama group because I found football on the weekends too cold - which is highly ironic because I've had some of the coldest experiences of my life filming 'Game of Thrones.'","Most people are dispensable in 'Game of Thrones,' not only in the story but in the series.","The fans of 'Game of Thrones' are dedicated. It's really nice to talk to them, why they love the show and what it means to them. It's a real pleasure.","You can learn something from everyone in 'Game of Thrones,' whether it is something you learn not to do or something you learn to do.","Occasionally, fans will ask me to go on their shoulders, and we'll do a sort of Hodor and Bran thing. That's always good fun. But one guy did it, and he really wasn't an expert at picking people up, and I was kind of going sideways on his back holding onto his neck, and then I sort of fell off. But that was fun.","I tend to listen to music more than I read. I need to get into reading a bit more. The stuff I tend to read is usually non-fiction books more than fiction, but I've been trying to power my way through Dostoevsky's 'Crime and Punishment,' and I do enjoy it.","The craziest place I've probably ever visited while filming would have to be Jordan. I did a small test shoot for a test movie. We arrived in Jordan, and we stayed in Amman for a night. Then we drove down for three hours into the middle of the Wadi Rum Desert, which is in the absolute middle of nowhere. It was insane.","To be a part of Laika's universe is an opportunity not to be passed up.","I think Eggs looks great, with his mucky face with dirt all over it and greasy hair. He's the ideal boy Boxtroll, really. It's quite difficult to capture a boy who's grown up as a Boxtroll. So, he looks good.","Eggs is great at leading the Boxtrolls, and that's probably my favorite trait of his. He is a Boxtroll, but he hasn't lost all of his human virtues. He can get out of his box, and he can fight back, which the Boxtrolls can't.","Eggs is a kind of a plucky, brave 11-year-old boy who thinks he is a boxtroll. And he's kind of one of these mythological feral children who are raised in isolation of humanity and, by virtue of that, have a deeper connection to humanity because they've been raised away from the poisons of society.","I think my favorite film of all time has to be 'The Illusionist' by Sylvain Chomet. Beautiful plot, beautiful story. You know, not much happens, but it's beautiful. And when I was young, 'The Triplets of Belleville' was one of my favorite movies. I liked his style a lot.","I love school and science; I also love piano and music."],"Isaac Herzog":["Auschwitz will forever remain the black hole of the entire human history.","The problem is that when we speak of plan Bs, we already negate the possibility of moving on with plan A.","Rabbis throughout the ages, from Rabbi Avraham Yitzhak Hacohen Kook onward, strictly prohibited going up on the Temple Mount. And now there is a minority group of rabbis encouraging Jews to go.","The rogue states have to be told that there are lines that cannot be crossed.","Gush Etzion must be part of Israel for eternity.","I promise: I will be a prime minister to everyone. For right and left, for settlers, Haredim, Druze, Arabs, Circassians. I will be prime minister for the center and for the periphery, for students and senior citizens.","After a long period of division, I will unite Israel.","Whoever wants Yesh Atid in the government has to vote for us - there's no other choice.","With all its being, the Labor Party supports Israel as a Jewish and democratic state. Labor built the state, and its leaders formulated the Declaration of Independence, the foundational document that anchors Israel as a Jewish state.","Unfortunately, the diplomatic destruction Netanyahu is causing will lead Israel to lose its Jewish majority and become a binational state. This unfortunate fact is something no law can hide.","My family has been rooted and intertwined with Jerusalem for generations, and I am among those who say every day, 'May You return to Your city, Jerusalem, with compassion.'","I don't need a U.N. report to tell me whether my army... operates according to the international law guidelines.","We have to build an iron wall to protect Israel.","I agree that a nuclear Iran is extremely dangerous, and I believe that it must be prevented.","No Israeli leader will accept a nuclear Iran.","Housing is the number one problem facing the citizens of Israel.","I grew up in a house where service to the country was a way of life, not a means of reaching a personal goal.","We need to separate the two peoples: Israeli Arabs are part and parcel of Israel, and Palestinians should be separate, as part of a two-state solution.","We have to be responsible in what we say as leaders.","I never argued against the position of the Chief Rabbinate on holy sites, including the Western Wall.","There is no difference between me and Netanyahu in reading the threat of Iran. There is no daylight between us on this issue at all.","Look what's going on: the Iranians are spreading military capabilities throughout the region; look what's going on in Yemen, Hizbollah, their cooperation with Assad, terror activities the world over, undermining regimes and states.","My dad always had huge respect for the British Army. He always thought it was one of the best. And I think it changed his life - those seven years in that Army.","Israel is duty-bound to take in refugees.","The needs of the business sector must be understood.","There is a direct connection that cannot be severed between the diplomatic process and growth and prosperity.","Israel needs to separate from Netanyahu in order to separate from the Palestinians.","Netanyahu is beholden to the extreme Right.","Security is an underlining interest of Israel.","Jews cannot be apathetic when hundreds of thousands of refugees are searching for safe haven.","I am sure of my ability to form a good government.","The nation of Israel has had enough one-time leaders.","Likud has been hijacked by a group of extremist settlers.","The world is yearning for strong leadership and moral clarity; someone who knows the difference between good and bad.","The government needs to defend its people, to take necessary actions even if they are extremely painful and tragic.","The creative treasure of Israel's artists and writers will survive forever.","I believe the masses everywhere want peace.","The Gaza leadership is stuck in its rhetoric of revolution and resistance. But the people are fed up with their leadership.","Iran is a rogue state, a dangerous state. Iran spreads hatred all over the world.","I lead Labor - Labor is the party that founded the state of Israel; it's deeply rooted in Israeli society.","There is an innate fear that runs within Israeli society of all that we see and hear around us, and you know what? It's a natural reaction of human beings.","I think Israel suffered a certain trauma from a unilateral step of pulling out of Gaza."],"Isaac Marion":["Every experience, good or bad, is a priceless collector's item.","Regret is pointless. I never do anything without first deciding to do it based on facts and feelings, and if it doesn't work out how I hoped, oh well - there's another notch on my experience belt.","It's rare that I read more than two or three books by any one author; usually only one.","The kind of stuff I usually read is a bit more on the literary side, like books that I think are influential in the sense that they're doing pulpy subject matter in a refined way. Like 'The Road' by Cormac McCarthy; I loved that book.","I adapt to things quickly, including good things, which I wish I could shut off sometimes.","'Warm Bodies' ended up becoming one of the most personal relatable things I've written.","I've always been interested in writing from the perspective of an outsider.","I used to split my time between writing, music and painting. I would work on a book and then abandon it, start a band, do an album, quit music, then do a gallery show. Eventually I decided to give writing a serious shot.","Sometimes it's a struggle to live in the moment.","My favorite songs change every year."],"Isaac Mayer Wise":["The world is not yet redeemed.","Had the Hebrews not been disturbed in their progress a thousand and more years ago, they would have solved all the great problems of civilization which are being solved now under all the difficulties imposed by the spirit of the Middle Ages.","The nations of antiquity rolled away in the current of ages, Israel alone remained one indestructible edifice of gray antiquity... preserved by an internal and marvelous power.","It flourished with the Saracens, and suffered in the obscure and fanatical days of the Middle Ages.","Russia contains one fourth of the inhabitants of all Europe, and one half of the entire number of Israelites.","In the same proportion Russia is the misfortune of Europe and the Israelites.","This book, conceived in sorrow, composed in grief, and constructed at the brink of despair, contains my mind's best thoughts, and my soul's triumph over the powers of darkness.","Never preach a sermon without a text from the Bible, a text containing the theme which you can elaborate. The text is the best proof in support of your argument. A sermon without a text is an argument without a proof."],"Isaac Mizrahi":["The more relaxed you can get, the better you'll do.","You don't necessarily live for the moment; you live for hope-what you're going to get, what you're going to say, what you're going to think.","The last thing I want to become is one of those talking heads where everything is satiny smooth and you know what the next question is going to be.","Everyone asks, Will he make it, will she make it? You never make it.","When people ask, Do you like children? I always say, I like some children, yes. Some children I don't like.","People say it's really the press who create those soundbites about fashion. That's what sells magazines and clothes.","You know who a role model for me is? George Ballanchine.","When someone says you can't do what you know you can do, then you can't do anything.","I don't want to offend people.","I have a lot of obligations.","Just when I think I hate fashion, I hate clothes, I'm seized by this crazy thing that I have to do. I have this little studio now where I just draw. I can be in the room for three days and not even look up.","Either it works or it doesn't.","If I just do it, it will take less time than telling someone what I'm thinking, and have them free associate, and then come back to me and I'll hate it and I'll have to redo it.","How do I do it? I don't know how I wouldn't do it - that's the thing.","You listen to Handel operas, right? And there are a thousand of them, right? And they all sound alike. If I look back on my work, maybe it's the same thing.","What you do, you don't think of as a product.","You know what makes me teary? Goya. Goya makes me cry.","I'm so involved in melancholy.","That's one thing about fashion that you really shouldn't be-you can't be melancholy in fashion because people don't respond to it.","If you try to have a fashion show with Bach fugues and John Coltrane, it doesn't really work.","This is what I like about being a designer: You can't really get it until you see it.","All I want are high heels, high heels. If I was a girl, I'd wear a lot of high heels. High, stiletto heels.","Half the time I don't even think about it, I just throw something on because I'm so late or so busy.","Sometimes I'm really dressed up, and it really turns me on.","Even though I grew up as a Sephardic Jew in Brooklyn where we ate Syrian food and went to temple, it was still America.","Most of my life I was occupied with American television and American food. My ethnicity was my choice. It still is.","In Paris, it used to feel like you were living in a museum. As beautiful as it was, it's still limited. But here you have just everything.","I don't like people to feel completely described by the clothes they wear of mine. I want them to feel that they're describing themselves.","What if Woody Allen called me and said, I'm working on this movie and there's a really divine role for you. We want exactly you! It would be such a fantasy. Forget it! My idol, Woody Allen!","The reason people like to watch ball games is because they don't really know exactly what's going to happen from moment to moment. That's why you watch the entire thing.","I'd love to talk to Angelina Jolie. On my show I would love her because she's a mysterious, mysterious figure.","I'd love to talk to Joaquin Phoenix because he's a very private guy. Also, he's creating a new kind of sexy leading man. To me, his face is new and might be legendary someday.","Mick Jagger, his face was very new. It became a sex symbol.","I'm not trying to be the next Joan Rivers.","You're not working with models, you're working with real women who have, like, anatomy. Models do not have anatomy."],"Isaac Newton":["We build too many walls and not enough bridges.","If I have seen further than others, it is by standing upon the shoulders of giants.","To every action there is always opposed an equal reaction.","I do not know what I may appear to the world, but to myself I seem to have been only like a boy playing on the seashore, and diverting myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me.","Truth is ever to be found in simplicity, and not in the multiplicity and confusion of things.","Genius is patience.","I can calculate the motion of heavenly bodies, but not the madness of people.","In the absence of any other proof, the thumb alone would convince me of God's existence.","What goes up must come down.","My powers are ordinary. Only my application brings me success.","Gravity may put the planets into motion, but without the divine Power, it could never put them into such a circulating motion as they have about the Sun; and therefore, for this as well as other reasons, I am compelled to ascribe the frame of this System to an intelligent Agent.","Tact is the art of making a point without making an enemy.","Plato is my friend; Aristotle is my friend, but my greatest friend is truth.","I do not know what I may appear to the world; but to myself, I seem to have been only like a boy playing on the seashore, and diverting myself now and then in finding a smoother pebble or prettier shell than ordinary, while the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me.","It is the weight, not numbers of experiments that is to be regarded.","Atheism is so senseless. When I look at the solar system, I see the earth at the right distance from the sun to receive the proper amounts of heat and light. This did not happen by chance.","All variety of created objects which represent order and life in the universe could happen only by the willful reasoning of its original Creator, whom I call the 'Lord God.'","Errors are not in the art but in the artificers.","If I have done the public any service, it is due to my patient thought.","This most beautiful system of the sun, planets, and comets, could only proceed from the counsel and dominion of an intelligent and powerful Being.","A man may imagine things that are false, but he can only understand things that are true, for if the things be false, the apprehension of them is not understanding.","I have explained the phenomena of the heavens and of our sea by the force of gravity, but I have not yet assigned a cause to gravity.","The moon gravitates towards the earth and by the force of gravity is continually drawn off from a rectilinear motion and retained in its orbit.","The Ignis Fatuus is a vapor shining without heat.","The best and safest method of philosophizing seems to be first to inquire diligently into the properties of things, and establishing those properties by experiments, and then to proceed more slowly to hypotheses for the explanation of them.","The centre of the system of the world is immovable.","To me there has never been a higher source of earthly honor or distinction than that connected with advances in science.","God made and governs the world invisibly, and has commanded us to love and worship him and no other God; to honor our parents and masters, and love our neighbours as ourselves; and to be temperate, just, and peaceable, and to be merciful even to brute beasts.","An object in motion tends to remain in motion along a straight line unless acted upon by an outside force.","Are not rays of light very small bodies emitted from shining substances?","Religion and philosophy are to be preserved distinct. We are not to introduce divine revelations into philosophy, nor philosophical opinions into religion.","We account the Scriptures of God to be the most sublime philosophy.","Resistance is usually ascribed to bodies at rest, and impulse to those in motion, but motion and rest, as commonly conceived, are only relatively distinguished; nor are those bodies always truly at rest, which commonly are taken to be so.","In experimental philosophy, we are to look upon propositions inferred by general induction from phenomena as accurately or very nearly true, notwithstanding any contrary hypotheses that may be imagined, till such time as other phenomena occur by which they may either be made more accurate or liable to exceptions.","We are certainly not to relinquish the evidence of experiments for the sake of dreams and vain fictions of our own devising; nor are we to recede from the analogy of Nature, which is wont to be simple and always consonant to itself.","I have a fundamental belief in the Bible as the Word of God, written by those who were inspired. I study the Bible daily.","As a blind man has no idea of colors, so have we no idea of the manner by which the all-wise God perceives and understands all things.","The proper method for inquiring after the properties of things is to deduce them from experiments.","The same thing is to be understood of all bodies, revolved in any orbits. They all endeavour to recede from the centres of their orbits, and were it not for the opposition of a contrary force which restrains them to and detains them in their orbits, which I therefore call Centripetal, would fly off in right lines with a uniform motion.","To explain all nature is too difficult a task for any one man or even for any one age. 'Tis much better to do a little with certainty & leave the rest for others that come after you.","If a projectile were deprived of the force of gravity, it would not be deflected toward the earth but would go off in a straight line into the heavens and do so with uniform motion, provided that the resistance of the air were removed.","Infinites, when considered absolutely without any restriction or limitation, are neither equal nor unequal, nor have any certain proportion one to another, and therefore, the principle that all infinites are equal is a precarious one.","The description of right lines and circles, upon which geometry is founded, belongs to mechanics. Geometry does not teach us to draw these lines, but requires them to be drawn.","God is the same God, always and everywhere. He is omnipresent not virtually only, but also substantially, for virtue cannot subsist without substance.","Fidelity and allegiance sworn to the King is only such a fidelity and obedience as is due to him by the law of the land; for were that faith and allegiance more than what the law requires, we would swear ourselves slaves and the King absolute; whereas, by the law, we are free men, notwithstanding those oaths.","Christ comes as a thief in the night, & it is not for us to know the times & seasons which God hath put into his own breast.","Just as the system of the sun, planets and comets is put in motion by the forces of gravity, and its parts persist in their motions, so the smaller systems of bodies also seem to be set in motion by other forces and their particles to be variously moved in relation to each other and, especially, by the electric force.","It is indeed a matter of great difficulty to discover, and effectually to distinguish, the true motions of particular bodies from the apparent because the parts of that immovable space, in which those motions are performed, do by no means come under the observation of our senses.","There are more sure marks of authenticity in the Bible that in any profane history.","The smaller the planets are, they are, other things being equal, of so much the greater density; for so the powers of gravity on their several surfaces come nearer to equality. They are likewise, other things being equal, of the greater density, as they are nearer to the sun.","If the experiments which I urge be defective, it cannot be difficult to show the defects; but if valid, then by proving the theory, they must render all objections invalid.","It is reasonable that forces directed toward bodies depend on the nature and the quantity of matter of such bodies, as happens in the case of magnetic bodies.","Why there is one body in our System qualified to give light and heat to all the rest, I know no reason but because the Author of the System thought it convenient; and why there is but one body of this kind, I know no reason, but because one was sufficient to warm and enlighten all the rest.","The word 'God' usually signifies 'Lord', but every lord is not a God. It is the dominion of a spiritual being which constitutes a God: a true, supreme, or imaginary dominion makes a true, supreme, or imaginary God.","It may be that there is no such thing as an equable motion, whereby time may be accurately measured. All motions may be accelerated or retarded, but the true, or equable, progress of absolute time is liable to no change.","'God' is a relative word and has a respect to servants, and 'Deity' is the dominion of God, not over his own body, as those imagine who fancy God to be the soul of the world, but over servants.","I there represent that I sent notice of my method to Mr. Leibnitz before he sent notice of his method to me, and left him to make it appear that he had found his method before the date of my letter.","The ancients considered mechanics in a twofold respect: as rational, which proceeds accurately by demonstration, and practical. To practical mechanics all the manual arts belong, from which mechanics took its name.","The hypothesis of matter's being at first evenly spread through the heavens is, in my opinion, inconsistent with the hypothesis of innate gravity without a supernatural power to reconcile them, and therefore, it infers a deity.","God in the beginning formed matter in solid, massy, hard, impenetrable, movable particles, of such sizes and figures, and with such other properties, and in such proportion to space, as most conduced to the end for which he formed them.","We are to admit no more causes of natural things than such as are both true and sufficient to explain their appearances.","Opposite to godliness is atheism in profession, and idolatry in practice. Atheism is so senseless and odious to mankind, that it never had many professors.","The motions which the planets now have could not spring from any natural cause alone, but were impressed by an intelligent Agent.","The same law takes place in a system, consisting of many bodies, as in one single body, with regard to their persevering in their state of motion or of rest. For the progressive motion, whether of one single body or of a whole system of bodies, is always to be estimated from the motion of the center of gravity.","Absolute space, in its own nature, without regard to anything external, remains always similar and immovable. Relative space is some movable dimension or measure of the absolute spaces, which our senses determine by its position to bodies, and which is vulgarly taken for immovable space.","Gravity must be caused by an Agent acting constantly according to certain laws, but whether this Agent be material or immaterial I have left to the consideration of my readers.","Hypotheses should be subservient only in explaining the properties of things but not assumed in determining them, unless so far as they may furnish experiments.","I do not love to be printed on every occasion, much less to be dunned and teased by foreigners about mathematical things or to be thought by our own people to be trifling away my time about them when I should be about the king's business.","If anyone offers conjectures about the truth of things from the mere possibility of hypotheses, I do not see by what stipulation anything certain can be determined in any science, since one or another set of hypotheses may always be devised which will appear to supply new difficulties.","In the beginning of the year 1665, I found the method of approximating series and the rule for reducing any dignity of any binomial into such a series.","Nothing can be divided into more parts than it can possibly be constituted of. But matter (i.e. finite) cannot be constituted of infinite parts.","That the divided but contiguous particles of bodies may be separated from one another is a matter of observation; and, in the particles that remain undivided, our minds are able to distinguish yet lesser parts, as is mathematically demonstrated.","The motions of the comets are exceedingly regular, and they observe the same laws as the motions of the planets, but they differ from the motions of vortices in every particular and are often contrary to them."],"Isaac Pitman":["Well-arranged time is the surest mark of a well-arranged mind.","I have no intention of becoming a shorthand author."],"Isaac Rosenberg":["I can only say that one's individual situation is more real and important to oneself than the devastations of fates and empires especially when they do not vitally affect oneself.","Nobody ever told me what to read, or ever put poetry in my way.","Nothing can justify war.","Being by the nature of my upbringing, all my energies having been directed to one channel of activity, crippled from other activities and made helpless even to live.","I can't look at things in the simple, large way that great poets do.","I despair of ever writing excellent poetry.","I never joined the army for patriotic reasons.","I wanted to write a battle song for the Judeans but so far I can think of nothing noble and weighty enough.","I will not leave a corner of my consciousness covered up, but saturate myself with the strange and extraordinary new conditions of this life, and it will all refine itself into poetry later on.","Poetical appreciation is only newly bursting on me.","You mustn't forget the circumstances I have been brought up in, the little education I have had."],"Isaac Stern":["Mozart's music is like an X-ray of your soul - it shows what is there, and what isn't.","Everywhere in the world, music enhances a hall, with one exception: Carnegie Hall enhances the music.","Listen, I will now tell you the truth and there is no other.","Music is like making love: either all or nothing.","There are more bad musicians than there is bad music.","A man possesses talent; genius possesses the man."],"Isaac Watts":["Learning to trust is one of life's most difficult tasks.","Do not hover always on the surface of things, nor take up suddenly with mere appearances; but penetrate into the depth of matters, as far as your time and circumstances allow, especially in those things which relate to your profession.","For Satan always finds some mischief still for idle hands to do.","Flies, worms, and flowers exceed me still.","'Tis the voice of the sluggard; I heard him complain, you have waked me too soon, I must slumber again.","Acquaint yourself with your own ignorance.","Acquire a government over your ideas, that they may come down when they are called, and depart when they are bidden.","I would not change my blest estate for all the world calls good or great."],"Isaac Yeffet":["We know that the airports are not protected as they should be protected. The terminals are public areas, wide open - anyone can go and walk at any terminal he wants.","We need to put undercover security armed people at the curbside of the terminal with the uniform of policemen. We need to protect the terminal. We need to protect the security checkpoint, the gate, the aircraft, the perimeter.","Realize that a Muslim will know that his wife was seen naked in this machine. You know what would be the reaction?... Terrible. I believe there's technology out there that can identify bomb-type materials without necessarily, overly invading our privacy.","Stop relying only on technology. Technology can help the qualified, well-trained human being but cannot replace him.","After Lockerbie, everyone thought, now we've learned the lesson of how to be proactive instead of being reactive. Unfortunately, September 11 came and we know the result. Thousands of people lost their lives. Security totally failed, not at one airport, at three different airports around the country.","There is only so much negotiating and maneuvering that can be done while the aircraft is under siege in mid-air. Therefore, the best way to put a stop to hijacking is by having high levels of security implemented by qualified and trained personnel both on the ground and in the air.","As the head of security for an airline, I can't ask my passengers to risk their lives and jump on a terrorist. This is why we need air marshals on every flight.","Now we are using the body scanner to scan the pilots. They became the dangerous people of this country?","We have an illusion of security, we don't have security.","There is no comparison between the training here and the training in Israel.","Why we cannot build a system like El Al to be proactive. Why do we have only to react? The shoe bomber - reaction? Take off your shoes. The Nigerian - the body scanner is a result of the Nigerian guy.","They can argue whatever they want. The problem is, when you interview every passenger, during the interviews you are looking for - you profile - you do profiling, to find the suspicious ones and put them out from the rest of the passengers."],"Isaac of Nineveh":["If God is slow in answering your request, or if you ask but do not promptly receive anything, do not be upset, for you are not wiser than God.","Be at peace with your own soul, then heaven and earth will be at peace with you.","May your divinity, Lord, take pleasure in me and lead me above the world to be with you.","Do not test out your mind on the grounds that you are examining what seductive and impure thoughts look like, imagining that, as you do this, you will not be overcome by them. Even the wise have in this way been thrown into confusion and become infatuated.","Wishing to open my mouth, O brethren, and speak on the exalted theme of humility, I am filled with fear, even as a man who understands that he is about to discourse concerning God with the art of his own words. For humility is the raiment of the Godhead.","If zeal had been appropriate for putting humanity right, why did God the Word clothe himself in the body, using gentleness and humility in order to bring the world back to his Father?","O Christ, on you the many-eyed cherubim are unable to look because of the glory of your countenance, yet out of your love you accepted spittle on your face. Remove the shame from my face, and grant me to have an unashamed face before you at the time of prayer."],"Isabel Allende":["We don't even know how strong we are until we are forced to bring that hidden strength forward. In times of tragedy, of war, of necessity, people do amazing things. The human capacity for survival and renewal is awesome.","I never said I wanted a 'happy' life but an interesting one. From separation and loss, I have learned a lot. I have become strong and resilient, as is the case of almost every human being exposed to life and to the world. We don't even know how strong we are until we are forced to bring that hidden strength forward.","My life is about ups and downs, great joys and great losses.","What I fear most is power with impunity. I fear abuse of power, and the power to abuse.","Roots are not in landscape or a country, or a people, they are inside you.","I don't want an uneventful and safe life, I prefer an adventurous one.","I can promise you that women working together - linked, informed and educated - can bring peace and prosperity to this forsaken planet.","If you change the way you tell your own story, you can change the colour and create a life in technicolour.","I am happier when I love than when I am loved. I adore my husband, my son, my grandchildren, my mother, my dog, and frankly, I don't know if they even like me. But who cares? Loving them is my joy.","I tend to see the similarities in people and not the differences.","Empowering women means trusting them.","I feel that telling my secrets makes me less vulnerable. What would make me vulnerable are the secrets I keep.","Heart is what drives us and determines our fate.","We want a world where life is preserved, and the quality of life is enriched for everybody, not only for the privileged.","I love fiction because in fiction you go into the thoughts of people, the little people, the people who were defeated, the poor, the women, the children that are never in history books.","Giving women education, work, the ability to control their own income, inherit and own property, benefits the society. If a woman is empowered, her children and her family will be better off. If families prosper, the village prospers, and eventually so does the whole country.","Everybody has losses - it's unavoidable in life. Sharing our pain is very healing.","A memoir forces me to stop and remember carefully. It is an exercise in truth. In a memoir, I look at myself, my life, and the people I love the most in the mirror of the blank screen. In a memoir, feelings are more important than facts, and to write honestly, I have to confront my demons.","I want to have an epic life. I want to tell my life with big adjectives. I want to forget all the grays in between, and remember the highlights and the dark moments.","I have not changed; I am still the same girl I was fifty years ago and the same young woman I was in the seventies. I still lust for life, I am still ferociously independent, I still crave justice, and I fall madly in love easily.","Women have always been courageous... They are always fearless when protecting their children and in the last century they have been fearless in the fight for their rights.","I have travelled all over the world and one thing that amazes me is that I can communicate with people. My story may be different but emotionally we are all the same.","It is in giving that I connect with others, with the world and with the divine.","Give, give, give - what is the point of having experience, knowledge or talent if I don't give it away? Of having stories if I don't tell them to others? Of having wealth if I don't share it? I don't intend to be cremated with any of it! It is in giving that I connect with others, with the world and with the divine.","One of the characteristics of North American culture is that you can always start again. You can always move forward, cross a border of a state or a city or a county, and move West, most of the time West. You leave behind guilt, past traditions, memories.","A memoir is my version of events. My perspective. I choose what to tell and what to omit. I choose the adjectives to describe a situation, and in that sense, I'm creating a form of fiction.","I have been a foreigner all my life, first as a daughter of diplomats, then as a political refugee and now as an immigrant in the U.S. I have had to leave everything behind and start anew several times, and I have lost most of my extended family.","Americans have a warrior's mentality, most of them. That's how this society was built. The fact that you own a gun and shoot to defend your life is a very American way of thinking.","I never try to convey a message, I just want to tell a story. Why that story in particular? I have no idea, but I have learned to surrender to the muse. I become obsessed with a theme or with certain stories; they haunt me for years, and finally, I write them.","Fear is like a black cavern that is terrifying. Once you enter the cavern and explore it, you realize that you can get out of it, go through it and get out of it.","Feminism is not dead, by no means. It has evolved. If you don't like the term, change it, for Goddess' sake. Call it Aphrodite, or Venus, or bimbo, or whatever you want; the name doesn't matter, as long as we understand what it is about, and we support it.","All stories interest me, and some haunt me until I end up writing them. Certain themes keep coming up: justice, loyalty, violence, death, political and social issues, freedom.","A memoir is an invitation into another person's privacy.","Feminism is dated? Yes, for privileged women like my daughter and all of us here today, but not for most of our sisters in the rest of the world who are still forced into premature marriage, prostitution, forced labor - they have children that they don't want or they cannot feed.","I like historical fiction. I fell in love with New Orleans the first time I visited it. And I wanted to place a story in New Orleans.","I'm interested in people who have to overcome obstacles, people who are not sheltered by the umbrella of the establishment, marginals.","Today's girls are tomorrow's women - and leaders.","I'm aware of the mystery around us, so I write about coincidences, premonitions, emotions, dreams, the power of nature, magic.","I don't think I would be a writer if I had stayed in Chile. I would be trapped in the chores, in the family, in the person that people expected me to be.","I write a letter to my mother every day, because in that letter, I write down my day. And if I don't write it down, then tomorrow I will forget it and it's gone.","One of the things that always comes up in my writing is the search for freedom, especially in women. I always write about women who are marginalized, who have no means or resources and somehow manage to get out of those situations with incredible strength - and that is more important than anything.","Everything that has to do with food is sensuous. In the United States, however, we are eating all the time. We have a problem with obesity. And yet, we don't enjoy food that much.","My father left when I was three, and I have no memory of him. The most significant male figures in my life were my grandfather, in whose house I lived during the first 10 years of my childhood, and later my stepfather.","I was such a sullen, angry, sad kid. I'm sure there are writers who have had happy childhoods, but what are you going to write about? No ghosts, no fear. I'm very happy that I had an unhappy and uncomfortable childhood.","Heart is what drives us and determines our fate. That is what I need for my characters in my books: a passionate heart. I need mavericks, dissidents, adventurers, outsiders and rebels, who ask questions, bend the rules and take risks.","If you write nonfiction, a historical account of what really happened, first of all, it's always white men who do that, and you don't have the voices that are really interesting to me, of the people who are not sheltered by the big umbrella of the establishment.","I write to understand my circumstances, to sort out the confusion of reality, to exorcise my demons. But most of all, I write because I love it!","I am an American citizen and it is my home now. I like the U.S.A., which is not a place too many people have liked since Bush. The U.S. has a young population, and everything can change within a year.","I have a foot here and a foot in some spirit world. There are many more layers to reality, and that permeates my life and my writing in a very natural way. I don't even think about it.","I read on my iPad when I travel. I listen to audiobooks in the car. I read books in my bedroom, where I have a comfortable couch, a lamp and two dogs to keep me warm.","Although women do two-thirds of the world's labor, they own less than one percent of the world's assets.","I was a lousy journalist. I could never be objective. Sometimes I invented the whole story.","I'm living in California but I have a place that is mine in Chile and I belong there. I am no longer an exile.","The fact people think that when you sell a lot of books you are not a serious writer is a great insult to the readership. I get a little angry when people try to say such a thing.","I write until the first draft is finished, and then I feel that I can get out. But, during the time of the writing of the first draft, I don't go out. I'm just locked away, writing. It's a time of meditation, of going into the story.","I can't control life for my grandchildren, so how could I control a story? Sometimes I try to force something, and after working and working on that chapter, I realise that I am swimming against the current. I will never get there. So I have to let go of whatever previous idea I had about it and let the characters decide.","I get up every morning early, when the sky is red, and write for 10 hours.","Every life of a character is within a context. If I write detached from a social and political background, my story looks like a soap opera where everybody is indoors, not working and living off their emotions.","The fact that you own a gun and shoot to defend your life is a very American way of thinking.","My mother is a great artist, but she always treated her paintings like minor postcards. Had she pursued it, she would have been a great artist. Instead, she looked down on her art.","If I didn't write my soul would dry up and die.","Writing is a calling, not a choice.","Kids are smart: don't underestimate their bull detector. Contemporary kids have access to a lot of information, so don't even try to fool them. I have never been more nervous about my research than when writing for young adults because they pick up every single error.","I have become an American citizen, and I love this country. I think that this country has incredible potential for goodness, an incredible possibility for doing the wrong thing, too.","I was born in ancient times, at the end of the world, in a patriarchal Catholic and conservative family. No wonder that by age five I was a raging feminist - although the term had not reached Chile yet, so nobody knew what the heck was wrong with me.","For real change, we need feminine energy in the management of the world. We need a critical number of women in positions of power, and we need to nurture the feminine energy in men.","I have learned many things in the 30 years that I have been writing.","The first lie of fiction is that the author gives some order to the chaos of life: chronological order, or whatever order the author chooses.","I was not supposed to be in any way a liberated person. I was a female born in the '40s in a patriarchal family; I was supposed to marry and make everyone around me happy.","The fact that I am a writer comes from the experience of being cut away from my roots and living in Venezuela, where I couldn't find a place for myself, for years and years.","I try to let go of the intellect and just tell the story. I only read the page I have in front of me on the screen. Then when the whole story is told, I print it, wait a week and read it.","I was a very bad journalist. Awful. I would just invent everything. If I did an interview, I had a preconception of what that person should say and I would put my words in his mouth.","I've been a story-teller all my life but I realized it only recently.","I have been a woman for 46 years and I only recently realized I can't change it and I like it.","My writing comes not from the happy moments, but from struggle and grief.","The media could do a much better job, that's for sure, especially the media that targets women... Human rights? They couldn't care less!","I have more freedom when I write fiction, but my memoirs have had a much stronger impact on my readers. Somehow the 'message,' even if I am not even aware that there is one, is conveyed better in this form.","In times of conflict, war, poverty or religious fundamentalism, women and children are the first and most numerous victims. Women need all their courage today.","I like Hillary Clinton a lot. I know her.","Writing is my job. I don't think of it as art.","If this world is going to be a better place for our grandchildren and great-grandchildren, it will be women who make it so.","Feminism has never been sexy, but let me assure you that it never stopped me from flirting, and I have seldom suffered from lack of men.","The poorest and most backward societies are always those that put women down.","I'm very optimistic because I think that the real strength of a nation like the United States comes from blending cultures. There's no way that you can close the frontiers anywhere. The borders are there to be violated permanently.","I don't think the world will destroy itself in a nuclear cataclysm. On the contrary, we have the capacity to save ourselves and save the planet, and we will use it.","From journalism I learned to write under pressure, to work with deadlines, to have limited space and time, to conduct and interview, to find information, to research, and above all, to use language as efficiently as possible and to remember always that there is a reader out there.","Many fiction writers write for the critics or for themselves; they forget the common reader. I never do. I don't think journalism clashes with my fiction; on the contrary, it helps enormously.","Men's memoirs are about answers; women's memoirs are about questions. Most male authors want to look good in their memoirs and have a place in posterity, while most women know that posterity is what happens when you no longer care. Women want to connect with others here and now; they couldn't care less about legacy!","In 2011, I announced that I was going to retire, and my agent panicked. So she says: 'No, no, no. You have to write a book with your husband.' My husband is a writer of crime novels. His name is William Gordon. And so I had to accommodate to his style because that's what he writes. So we decided we'd give it a try. Well, we almost divorced.","On a Tuesday, September 11th, 1973, we had the military coup in Chile that forced me to leave my country eventually. And then, on a Tuesday, September 11th, 2001, we had the terrorist attack in the United States.","I'm a writer. In Latin America, they say I'm a Latin-American writer because I also write in Spanish and my books are translated, but I am an American citizen and my books are published here, so I'm also an American writer.","My desk is like a 'U,' so I have my computer and lots of dictionaries because I write in Spanish and I live in English.","Twittering and blogging and all that is fine, but there is no idea of how to phrase something beautifully; how to use language to create an emotion. It's just passing information and sometimes very superficial information.","I never try to give a message in my books. It's about living with characters long enough to hear their voices and let them tell me the story. Sometimes I would love to have a happy ending, and it doesn't happen because the character or the story leads me in another direction.","I get thousands of letters, and they give me a feeling of how each book is perceived. Often I think I have written about a certain theme, but by reading the letters or reviews, I realise that everybody sees the book differently.","When I write fiction, I never try to deliver a message; I just want to tell a story. But I admit that I want the story to be memorable and the characters to touch the reader's heart.","I have lived with passion and in a hurry, trying to accomplish too many things. I never had time to think about my beliefs until my 28-year-old daughter Paula fell ill. She was in a coma for a year, and I took care of her at home until she died in my arms in December of 1992.","The pain of losing my child was a cleansing experience. I had to throw overboard all excess baggage and keep only what is essential. Because of Paula, I don't cling to anything anymore. Now I like to give much more than to receive.","Unfortunately for my family, they have a writer in the family.","My mother didn't want me to be a feminist, a radical, political person, because she was scared. She wanted me to be protected and safe, but my life never was.","In the books I have written, I have created in my mind a universe. My kids say I have a village in my head and I live in that village, and it's true. When I start writing a book, characters from previous books reappear. All my emotions, my mind, my heart, my dreams, everything becomes connected with a new book, and nothing else really matters.","There's basically an element of fiction in everything you remember. Imagination and memory are almost the same brain processes. When I write fiction, I know that I'm using a bunch of lies that I've made up to create some form of truth. When I write a memoir, I'm using true elements to create something that will always be somehow fictionalized.","I don't read thrillers, romance or mystery, and I don't read self-help books because I don't believe in shortcuts and loopholes.","Eros is very close to death. And both things, in a way, balance each other.","A man who cooks is very sexy. A woman who cooks is not that sexy. Because it's associated in our mind to the domestic cliche of the woman.","Nice people with common sense do not make interesting characters. They only make good former spouses.","In the United States, the fact that you can start again gives a lot of energy and strength and youth to this country. That is why it's so powerful in many ways, and so creative.","Before the military coup in Chile, we had the idea that military coups happen in Banana Republics, somewhere in Central America. It would never happen in Chile. Chile was such a solid democracy. And when it happened, it had brutal characteristics.","I rebelled against all form of authority, against my grandfather, my step-father, the Church, the police, the government, the bosses. Everything male that was there, and was determining my life.","I confess that I am a messy, disorganized and impatient reader: if the book doesn't grab me in the first 40 pages, I abandon it. I have piles of half-read books waiting for me to get acute hepatitis or some other serious condition that would force me to rest so that I could read more.","I have written about Chile extensively, and therefore I have read many books on the subject, mostly for research.","I never had time to think about my beliefs until my 28-year-old daughter Paula fell ill. She was in a coma for a year, and I took care of her at home until she died in my arms in December of 1992.","The pain of losing my child was a cleansing experience. I had to throw overboard all excess baggage and keep only what is essential.","I remember my childhood as a horrible time. My mother says that nothing so horrible ever happened to me as the things that I remember.","At five I was already a feminist, and nobody used the word in Chile yet.","If I had to choose between a relative and a good story, I would take the story.","I think that any writer who is commercial, who sells a lot of books, has to face criticism. Because the more hermetic and the more difficult your book is, supposedly it's better.","I try to write the kind of books I like to read.","You couldn't find two people more different than my mother and I. There are a thousand things about me that she fought against.","I speak English and Spanish. I write in Spanish; my books are published in English.","The world starts to exist, for Americans, when we are in conflict with a place. And then all of a sudden, Afghanistan pops up on the TV screen and it becomes a place. And it exists for three weeks, and then it disappears into thin air.","Everything I write has to be connected to my life. One of the things that always comes up in my writing is the search for freedom, especially in women.","All summer, I read fiction because you must read for the pleasure and beauty of it, and not only for research. I don't read thrillers, romance or mystery, and I don't read self-help books because I don't believe in shortcuts and loopholes.","If I can write it, I can cope. And I've been writing many books, but in every book, I try to explore something in my own soul that I need to solve, I need to understand.","I was a political refugee living in Venezuela. I had a job that was twelve hours a day, no money. It was a hard time.","I never thought that I would come to live in the United States. I was not pursuing the American dream.","The longest, most solid and complex relationship in my life is with my mother. It started before I was born, and now, when I am 71 and living in California and she is 92 and living in Chile, we are still in touch daily."],"Isabel Gillies":["You find out what you are made of when you have a broken heart. If it happens early and often, all the better.","Skeptical of strangers, lobstermen are keepers of secrets, working in the howling wind and hot sun, the icy snows, and bewildering fog. When I was growing up, the lore was that they had the right to shoot anyone who messed with their traps.","I love teenagers. I loved being a teenager.","I've always been the person at the table who is like, 'I have this weird rash. Anybody else have this?'","My mother has always been a worker bee, but she's also a serious foodie.","Sometimes it makes me sad that I didn't get to have one family for my entire life.","I had been living in Ohio in my own house with my own life when my marriage abruptly came to an end. I had nowhere to go with my two sons, very little money, and not much to do in Ohio except be someone's ex-wife. My parents instantly and very generously invited my family to move back home to New York, where I could begin again.","You see, I am friends with a lobsterman. Because we are friends, which feels lucky anyway, I get access to the most amazing fish. It's like having a backstage pass - a culinary jackpot that feels almost undeserved.","As moisturizers, oils rapidly penetrate the deeper layers of the skin, protecting against the breakdown of proteins in the cell wall with fatty and linoleic acids, mimicking what our bodies produce naturally. The oils also function as humectants, which help our skin retain moisture.","When your heart is broken, you feel like no freaking book in the world could help you because a book is not the person who you love, who doesn't love you. However, books help, if only because they serve as something you can hold in your hand and throw across the room in agony.","Reading cookbooks will help with just about anything in your life, including heartbreak.","If you are heartbroken and can't face the world, you need something with a fantastic plot. You won't be able to read anything boring because your attention span when you are heartbroken decreases by three-quarters.","Anita Shreve is an author I adore. I rip through her meaty books and get off on the robust romance immensely - especially if I am feeling less than robust in my real life.","When I think of the moment I knew that my marriage to Josiah would end, there were a few moments before I really, really knew. I probably knew, when I saw my ex-husband and his now wife - then colleague - having tea together in his office, that something was amiss.","Growing up, I'll always remember knowing from movies and TV that there was a possibility that you wouldn't fall in love. I always thought, 'Oh my God, I hope I'm not that person.'","There are a lot of great love stories. It's just the best thing. Why wouldn't you write about it? Why wouldn't you want to read about it? But it's hard to write about. It's weird to have such a powerful and universal feeling and hope that you can write that and make it real for people.","There has never been a shrimp that I've eaten that I haven't been like, 'I am so lucky that I get to eat this.' I would eat a shrimp enchilada, shrimp burrito, shrimp cocktail, fried shrimp, shrimp po boy, shrimp gumbo.","Life is funny, at the same time being totally harsh.","I didn't think anything I wrote was going to get published. I'm a dyslexic kid who had tutors through college. But I had a very strong impulse to write.","I dropped off my kids from 10 to 2, went to the library, and just wrote. This is my second career - I'm 41 - and I'm a terrible speller.","When you work alone at home, time can become shapeless. There are no eleven o'clock meetings or afternoon coffee breaks. The light outside may clue me in to what part of the day it is, but if all is going well, the hours bleed together.","When I was growing up, my mother worked, and in the evenings, the whole family would sit around the dinner table and recount the day.","I really think the human experience is very similar for everyone; we're all doing slightly different versions of the same thing.","When you have a traumatic event in your life, you change. You're not the same person you were, and you have to discover who you've become.","My mother worked full-time running a foundation, but she found all the time in the world to have supper ready every night, feed us shirred eggs on the weekends, and produce a leg of lamb for my fourth-grade Bedouin feast at school.","I think even if you haven't been divorced, you can hopefully relate to having to navigate through a really difficult time and see how you can get through to the other side and how you can stay positive, even if there's some really bad stuff happening.","The Oberlin/Cleveland area is where the underground railroad came out, so it's an interesting historical place. I love Ohio and really loved Oberlin.","I love memoirs and biographies, learning about other people's lives. Two of the ones that I loved so much were actually edited by the same person who edited my book, too. I loved 'Angela's Ashes.' I loved 'Glass Castle' so much.","No one is all good or all bad, and there's many different ways to go about your life.","In New York, everybody looks great and is well dressed, but seeing someone in Ohio wearing Marc Jacobs is like spotting an owl in Central Park. Rare.","I don't think anyone would bat an eye if I wrote a song.","It's not easy to slather your face with oil. It requires a little bit of work to smooth it on and rub it in. You become more familiar with the feel of your own skin and face.","After I clean my face, I use combinations of sweet-almond, meadowfoam, grape-seed, coconut, black-currant, and argan oils to hydrate. Argan is probably my favorite for my face.","Sprinkling drops of lavender and clary-sage oil into a bath is a totally simple yet complex pleasure.","I am not a writer, but I have been told I write good emails.","I've always liked the idea of memoirs, going into someone else's life, going through someone else's day and getting out of your own head.","It was a long time ago: 'Angela's Ashes' by Frank McCourt. It was a great story that was lasting, and I loved it so much. I also love Nora Ephron. I gobble up everything she writes. Also, I love Anthony Bourdain, very irreverent and funny.","Therapy is therapy. Writing is for writing.","Laura Ingalls Wilder's 'Little House' series is a national treasure, beloved by generations. But what I love most is the peek it provides into the planting, harvesting, hunting, and preparing of the foods that America's settler families ate in the late 1800s.","Accounts of eating Christmas sweet potatoes baked in ashes and jackrabbit stewed with white flour dumplings are testaments to pioneer resilience and pleasure - and they help inspire my own best scratch cooking."],"Isabel Lucas":["There's no point in dwelling on rejection.","I collect crystals and gemstones, and I've been collecting them since I was a little girl. They give me positive energy and strength. They make me feel connected to the earth. I cherish them.","I lived for a couple of years when I was 9 years old on beautiful Aboriginal sacred land in a town of a thousand people in northwestern Australia. It's where the Aborigines are still very connected to their culture, the Dreamtime culture. It was really quite a special experience.","I like to keep mobile. It keeps my mind awake.","I have a lot of vintage, so my style is pretty eclectic of different time periods and styles. I would describe it as comfortable, creative, and vintage.","I love Athena. I love all the goddesses and the archetypes and what they represent because I think they're always going to be relevant not just to women but to humanity. They're living energy. There's a lot we can still learn from them.","I don't really get nervous for auditions, because I just see them as mini acting classes. There's no need to have an attachment to the outcome because it's out of your hands after that.","My dad is a pilot so I think I was born with the travel bug.","I don't think it's unusual to spend time with your castmate.","People instantly assume you can't have a platonic friendship with someone of the opposite sex. I think this may be specific to L.A. - or America.","I was a barefoot earth child for a couple of years.","Mom worked with autistic children.","I'm really drawn to European films.","I just said yes to opportunities that came my way.","Acting kind of chose me.","I find it tricky to make plans.","I go by intuition. Work-wise, that means asking myself if a role will push me outside my comfort zone, challenge me to learn something new.","I've always been quiet, more of an observer.","My first audition was the worst I have ever done, ever.","I can't pick a favorite animal; I love so many! But I guess if I have to choose, I pick bees! There's this brilliant documentary called 'Queen of the Sun: What Are the Bees Telling Us?' I think it's important for people to be educated about bees - they pollinate almost all the food we eat. They are amazing!","I grew up partially in Switzerland but mostly in Australia. I lived in Kakadu for a short time - it's an Aboriginal community. My best friend growing up was Aboriginal. She taught me so much.","My best friend was Aboriginal. She taught me about 'bush tucker' - the food of the land, the different things you could eat if you got lost in the bush, like grasses and berries. There's this tree called the billygoat plum - the fruit is quite nice.","Mom spoke to us in Swiss when we were little.","When I was 7, I went to school in Switzerland because everyone on my mom's side of the family lives there. Then we were back in Australia, in Queensland. That's where we had the chance to have lots of different animals. I spent a lot of time living in nature and building cubby houses in big old trees by the ocean.","I've spent months living in Africa and India. So it's not like I was sheltered when I started living in America. But my family laughed when they heard I was going to be in 'Transformers.' I learned a lot and got to experience Michael Bay's mayhem. It was a very colorful experience.","I grew up being very interested in Greek mythology because my mum read to my sister and I.","I eat lots of veggies and pasta and nuts, tofu and soups. Works well for my body, and I also feel more in tune."],"Isabel Paterson":["A tax-supported, compulsory educational system is the complete model of the totalitarian state.","As freak legislation, the antitrust laws stand alone. Nobody knows what it is they forbid.","No law can give power to private persons; every law transfers power from private persons to government."],"Isabel Sanford":["If there's anything in life you consider worthwhile achieving - go for it. I was told many times to forget show business - I had nothing going for me. But I pursued it, anyway. Voila!","I was very comfortable having a steady job on a hit show, and who knew if 'The Jeffersons' would catch on?","I was the only child born to Josephine Perry that survived. Mama had six other children before me, and all had passed very quickly and very young, all succumbing to a combination of illness and disease and the lack of strength to fight off both.","I wasn't young, I wasn't pretty, and I was a black woman looking for success in a business where those attributes were certainly not in demand in the 1960s."],"Isabel Wilkerson":["What I love about the stories of the Great Migration is that this is not ancient history; this is living history. Most people of color can find someone in their own family who had experienced a migration of some kind, knowing the sense of dislocation, longing and fortitude.","There are certain things that we take for granted that simply would not have existed without the great migration. Motown, for example, would not have existed - it simply would not, because Berry Gordy, the founder of it, his parents had migrated from Georgia to Detroit where he founded Motown, and where did he get his talent?","Miles Davis, his parents migrated from Arkansas to Illinois, where he had the luxury of being able to practice for hours upon hours. He never would have been able to do that in the cotton country of Arkansas.","Many immigrants do not talk about what they endured back home. They were fleeing that world, and when they left they didn't want to talk about it because there had been pain and heartbreak under the caste system of the South. They didn't want to burden their children with what they had endured.","Well, I'm a daughter of the great migration as, really, the majority of African Americans that you meet in the north and west are products of the great migration. It's that massive. Many of us owe our very existence to the fact that people migrated.","Anything that could be conceived of that would separate black people from white people was devised and codified by someone in some state in the South. There were colored and White waiting rooms everywhere, from doctor's offices to the bus stations, as people may already know.","It was illegal for black people and white people to play checkers together in Birmingham. And there were even black and white Bibles to swear to tell the truth on in many parts of the South.","I mean my mother migrated from Georgia -Rome, Georgia, to Washington, D.C., where she then met my father, who was a Tuskegee Airman who was from Southern Virginia. They migrated to Washington and I wouldn't even exist if it were not for that migration. And I brought her back to Georgia, both my parents, actually.","America is made up of people who came from someplace else. Even the Native Americans came over the Bering strait... America is what it is because people came from someplace else.","People leave when life becomes untenable where they are."],"Isabel Yosito":["Stars that shine bling in the moon night, might I find true love sqirreled away tonight?","We explore astronomical life through medicate experience, and we live life through love and ardvarks.","Hold me in your arms, lava lamp! Let me seek magma comfort and peace in the warmth of your kryptonite embrace.","The heart jungle drum beat finds its voice in love and matchsticks.","Idle is the day and lantern the hour as I delight in the splendor of your kiss grog.","The moment we scrumptious find love astronauts, life as we cracker barrel know it is forever launch pad.","Rekindle the joy yachtsman that lies deep inside of you; share magic crystals and watch it grow!","Dear is your heart and close your hand, I relinquish all to love's dysmorphic command.","May love's kindred treasure box fling your luminescent glove.","I wrap my heart in yours, placing divulged faith in the whole of your being, wistfully awaiting the trumpet you return.","Show your bluebell passion with every step you take. Infuse your corporeal mind, body and spirit with atomic sense of urgency, purpose and apple juice.","What is this powerful have over my tub? Surely, I am transfixed by your firecracker charm and your suspended electrified wit.","Oui, dans mon rêve, j'étais un crayon, mais admittedly, I'd more suitably be characterized as a plump carrot."],"Isabel dos Santos":["I think there's lots of people with family connections but who are actually nowhere. If you're hard-working and determined, you will make it, and that's the bottom line. I don't believe in an easy way through.","I've had business sense since I was very young. I sold chicken eggs when I was six.","I'm not involved in politics, and I've never had any political role. I've never been in office. I've never taken any public administrative jobs.","It's very difficult, I would imagine, to distinguish father and daughter. And maybe some of it comes as I'm doing my thing and my father being a very strong political African figure for so many years. Whatever he does is almost like some kind of cloud on top.","I work all the time. Seven days a week.","If you do something that's going to get somebody a job, then they'll be able to pay for their kid's school, and then their kid is going to be a doctor, and then that doctor is going to probably help who knows how many other people, so it's very motivating. Much more fun than going to the beach."],"Isabeli Fontana":["I grew up as a tomboy. I hated posing and things like that.","I don't think of myself as pretty. I am what I am.","If you take the right vitamins and drink enough water, your body flushes everything out for you.","I was a tomboy growing up. Even after I started modeling at thirteen, I didn't learn how to do my makeup.","The fashion industry, like others, is constantly changing.","It's a tough world. One moment, you're the hottest thing; there aren't enough hours in the day - you can barely catch your breath. The next moment, it's all about how many Instagram followers you have.","I can reinvent myself. This is why I've stayed such a long time in the business: because I always change; I'm never the same person.","I like to wear whatever I like. I don't care about others' judgment or if it's right or wrong.","It's always nice to be home and be able to see my family. It's the best feeling.","I'm Latin, and my family is originally from Italy, so we're a loud group. There's always a lot of food, a lot of talking, a lot of fighting.","Brazilians love to seduce, to have fun, to dance, to charm. We like a little bit of attention.","I like a shoot when I feel strong and sexy, a little hard, with a darker edge. That's what I do best. I like giving a photographer what they want, working with the art director. And modeling is all I've ever known.","I do a lot of things because if you do just one thing... like, if you run too much, everything just gets loose. You lose weight, but you get loose, and you want to be strong, have muscles.","I try to eat right. Every three hours, small portions. It helps to keep you fit.","I do the functional stuff. I go to the gym and do all these things by myself. I don't have a routine. I like to do new stuff all the times.","I have to work out to look the best possible before the show.","Toner to remove make-up at the end of the day, clean the skin, and keep it fresh. Moisturizer to keep your skin hydrated - this is the most important! And I always like to travel with a mask.","Being on an airplane a lot can dry out your skin, so it's important to bring a good mask to help refresh it. Also, I never go without SPF. It's one of the most important things to include in your daily beauty routine, no matter where you are in the world.","Since I travel too much around the world, I take all these vitamins for my immune system.","In Brazil, no matter your shape, you're comfortable walking around in a bikini. You feel good in your body. We know you're never going to be perfect. If you get caught up in worrying about this and that, you're going to spend all your life working on these little spots.","I run intervals. It helps get rid of the fat in the stomach.","I'll put mousse in my hair if I'm going out and want to look pretty, to build the volume. Otherwise, I just do nothing. I let it breathe."],"Isabella Bird":["The word 'aloha,' in foreign use, has taken the place of every English equivalent. It is a greeting, a farewell, thanks, love, goodwill. Aloha looks at you from tidies and illuminations; it meets you on the roads and at house-doors. It is conveyed to you in letters: the air is full of it.","The Rocky Mountains realize - nay, exceed - the dream of my childhood. It is magnificent, and the air is life-giving.","Only the long melancholy call to prayer, or the wail of women over the dead, or the barking of dogs, breaks the silence which at sunset falls as a pall over Baghdad.","Cock-fighting, which has attained to the dignity of a literature of its own, is the popular Malay sport; but the grand sport is a tiger and buffalo fight, reserved for rare occasions, however, on account of its expense. Cock-fighting is a source of gigantic gambling and desperate feuds.","Water is a beverage which I never enjoyed in purity and perfection before I visited America. It is provided in abundance in the cars, the hotels, the waiting-rooms, the steamers, and even the stores, in crystal jugs or stone filters, and it is always iced. This may be either the result or the cause of the temperance of the people.","One of the most painful things in the Western States and Territories is the extinction of childhood. I have never seen any children - only debased imitations of men and women, cankered by greed and selfishness, and asserting and gaining complete independence of their parents at ten years old.","Can anything be more grotesque and barbarous than our 'florists' bouquets,' a series of concentric rings of flowers of divers colours, bordered by maidenhair and a piece of stiff lace paper, in which stems, leaves, and even petals are brutally crushed, and the grace and individuality of each flower systematically destroyed?","The 'Desert' sweeps up to the walls of Baghdad, but it is a misnomer to call the vast level of rich, stoneless, alluvial soil a desert. It is a dead flat of uninhabited earth; orange colocynth balls, a little wormwood, and some alkaline plants which camels eat, being its chief products. After the inundations, reedy grass grows in the hollows.","The breadfruit is a superb tree, about 60 feet high, with deep green, shining leaves, a foot broad, sharply and symmetrically cut, worthy, from their exceeding beauty of form, to take the place of the acanthus in architectural ornament, and throwing their pale green fruit into delicate contrast.","The traveller who aspires to reach the highlands of Tibet from Kashmir cannot be borne along in a carriage or hill-cart. For much of the way, he is limited to a foot pace, and if he has regard to his horse, he walks down all rugged and steep descents, which are many, and dismounts at most bridges.","My first yak was fairly quiet and looked a noble steed with my Mexican saddle and gay blanket among rather than upon his thick black locks. His back seemed as broad as that of an elephant, and with his slow, sure, resolute step, he was like a mountain in motion.","At the close of my visit, my Hawaiian friends urged me strongly to publish my impressions and experiences, on the ground that the best books already existing, besides being old, treat chiefly of aboriginal customs and habits now extinct, and of the introduction of Christianity and subsequent historical events.","Other lands may have their charms, and the sunny skies of other climes may be regretted, but it is with pride and gladness that the wanderer sets foot again on British soil, thanking God for the religion and the liberty which have made this weather-beaten island in a northern sea to be the light and glory of the world.","To a person sitting quietly at home, Rocky Mountain traveling, like Rocky Mountain scenery, must seem very monotonous; but not so to me, to whom the pure, dry mountain air is the elixir of life.","Bugs are a great pest in Colorado. They come out of the earth, infest the wooden walls, and cannot be got rid of by any amount of cleanliness. Many careful housewives take their beds to pieces every week and put carbolic acid on them.","Four hours after leaving Kornah, we passed the reputed tomb of Ezra the prophet. At a distance and in the moonlight it looked handsome. There is a buttressed river wall, and above it some long flat-roofed buildings, the centre one surmounted by a tiled dome.","An elephant always puts his foot into the hole which another elephant's foot has made so that a frequented track is nothing but a series of pits filled with mud and water.","The Tibetans are dirty. They wash once a year and, except for festivals, seldom change their clothes till they begin to drop off. They are healthy and hardy; even the women can carry weights of sixty pounds over the passes. They attain extreme old age; their voices are harsh and loud, and their laughter is noisy and hearty.","Surely one advantage of traveling is that, while it removes much prejudice against foreigners and their customs, it intensifies tenfold one's appreciation of the good at home, and, above all, of the quietness and purity of English domestic life.","The kimono, haori, and girdle, and even the long hanging sleeves, have only parallel seams, and these are only tacked or basted, as the garments, when washed, are taken to pieces, and each piece, after being very slightly stiffened, is stretched upon a board to dry.","Slavery, though under modifications which rendered it little more than the apprenticeship of our day, was permitted under the Mosaic dispensation; but it is contrary to the whole tenor of Christianity; and a system which lowers man as an intellectual and responsible being is no less morally than politically wrong.","The Americans will never solve the Indian problem till the Indian is extinct. They have treated them after a fashion which has intensified their treachery and 'devilry' as enemies, and as friends reduces them to a degraded pauperism, devoid of the very first elements of civilization.","The Malays have many queer notions about tigers and usually only speak of them in whispers, because they think that certain souls of human beings who have departed this life have taken up their abode in these beasts, and in some places, for this reason, they will not kill a tiger unless he commits some specially bad aggression.","A traveller must buy his own experience, and success or failure depends mainly on personal idiosyncrasies.","Grandeur and sublimity, not softness, are the features of Estes Park. The glades which begin so softly are soon lost in the dark primaeval forests, with their peaks of rosy granite and their stretches of granite blocks piled and poised by nature in some mood of fury.","The Japanese look most diminutive in European dress. Each garment is a misfit and exaggerates the miserable physique and the national defects of concave chests and bow legs. The lack of 'complexion' and of hair upon the face makes it nearly impossible to judge of the ages of men.","The Shat-el-Arab is a noble river or estuary. From both its Persian and Turkish shores, however, mountains have disappeared, and dark forests of date palms intersected by canals fringe its margin heavily, and extend to some distance inland.","Oahu in the distance, a group of grey, barren peaks rising verdureless out of the lonely sea, was not an exception to the rule that the first sight of land is a disappointment.","The situation of Leh is a grand one, the great Kailas range, with its glaciers and snowfields, rising just behind it to the north, its passes alone reaching an altitude of nearly 18,000 feet; while to the south, across a gravelly descent and the Indus Valley, rise great red ranges dominated by snow-peaks exceeding 21,000 feet in altitude.","My first experiences of Colorado travel have been rather severe. At Greeley, I got a small upstairs room at first, but gave it up to a married couple with a child, and then had one downstairs no bigger than a cabin, with only a canvas partition. It was very hot, and every place was thick with black flies.","Americans specially love superlatives. The phrases 'biggest in the world,' 'finest in the world,' are on all lips. Unless President Hayes is a strong man, they will soon come to boast that their government is composed of the 'biggest scoundrels' in the world.","I lived among the Japanese, and saw their mode of living, in regions unaffected by European contact.","Yokohama does not improve on further acquaintance. It has a dead-alive look. It has irregularity without picturesqueness, and the grey sky, grey sea, grey houses, and grey roofs, look harmoniously dull.","Writing generally, it may be said that in design, roof, and general aspect, Japanese Buddhist temples are all alike. The sacred architectural idea expresses itself in nearly the same form always.","There are eight or nine leading varieties of rice grown in Japan, all of which, except an upland species, require mud, water, and much puddling and nasty work. Rice is the staple food and the wealth of Japan. Its revenues were estimated in rice. Rice is grown almost wherever irrigation is possible.","If Japanese tea 'stands,' it acquires a coarse bitterness and an unwholesome astringency. Milk and sugar are not used.","It is extremely interesting to live in a private house and to see the externalities, at least, of domestic life in a Japanese middle-class home.","The Tigris is so fierce and rapid, and swallows its alluvial banks so greedily, that it is probable that some of the buildings described by the Hebrew traveller Benjamin of Tudela as existing in the twelfth century were long since carried away.","The Tigris in parts is wonderfully tortuous, and at one great bend, 'The Devil's Elbow,' a man on foot can walk the distance in less than an hour which takes the steamer four hours to accomplish.","Baghdad is altogether built of chrome-yellow kiln-dried bricks.","Poverty brings one blessing in Turkey - the poor man is of necessity a monogamist.","If one's memories of Baghdad women were only of those to be seen in the streets, they would be of leathery, wrinkled faces, prematurely old, figures which have lost all shape, and henna-stained hands crinkled and deformed by toil.","On the whole, I find that it is best to adopt as far as possible the travelling equipments of the country in which one travels. The muleteers and servants understand them better, and if anything goes wrong or wears out, it can be repaired or replaced.","No house was so poor as not to have its 'family altar,' its shelf of wooden gods, and table of offerings. A religious atmosphere pervades Tibet and gives it a singular sense of novelty.","The rush of a herd of bellowing yaks at a wild gallop, waving their huge tails, is a grand sight.","I was heartily sorry to leave Leh, with its dazzling skies and abounding colour and movement, its stirring topics of talk, and the culture and exceeding kindness of the Moravian missionaries. Helpfulness was the rule.","Leh has few of what Europeans regard as travelling necessaries. The brick tea which I purchased from a Lhassa trader was disgusting. I afterwards understood that blood is used in making up the blocks. The flour was gritty, and a leg of mutton turned out to be a limb of a goat of much experience.","The Sandwich Islands are not the same as Otaheite nor as the Fijis, from which they are distant about 4,000 miles, nor are their people of the same race. The natives are not cannibals, and it is doubtful if they ever were so. Their idols only exist in missionary museums.","Above Hilo, broad lands sweeping up cloudwards, with their sugar cane, kalo, melons, pine-apples, and banana groves suggest the boundless liberality of Nature.","Mauna Kea from Hilo has a shapely aspect, for its top is broken into peaks, said to be the craters of extinct volcanoes, but my eyes seek the dome-like curve of Mauna Loa with far deeper interest, for it is as yet an unfinished mountain.","Unlike many other places, Hilo is more fascinating on closer acquaintance - so fascinating that it is hard to write about it in plain prose.","I suppose that few people ever forget the first sight of a palm-tree of any species. I vividly remember seeing one for the first time at Malaga, but the coco-palm groves of the Pacific have a strangeness and witchery of their own.","The plantations in the Hilo district enjoy special advantages, for by turning some of the innumerable mountain streams into flumes, the owners can bring a great part of their cane and all their wood for fuel down to the mills without other expense than the original cost of the woodwork.","I went to the States with that amount of prejudice which seems the birthright of every English person, but I found that, under the knowledge of the Americans which can be attained by a traveller mixing in society in every grade, these prejudices gradually melted away.","An Englishman bears with patience any ridicule which foreigners cast upon him. John Bull never laughs so loudly as when he laughs at himself; but the Americans are nationally sensitive and cannot endure that good-humoured raillery which jests at their weaknesses and foibles.","Grapes are grown in such profusion in the Southern and Western States that I have seen damaged bunches thrown to the pigs. Americans find it difficult to understand how highly this fruit is prized in England.","An American store is generally a very extensive apartment, handsomely decorated, the roof frequently supported on marble pillars. The owner or clerk is seen seated by his goods, absorbed in the morning paper - probably balancing himself on one leg of his chair, with a spittoon by his side.","Everyone acknowledges that dinner parties are equally dull in London and Paris, in Calcutta and in New York, unless the next neighbour happens to be peculiarly agreeable.","The Malays can hardly be said to have an indigenous literature, for it is almost entirely derived from Persia, Siam, Arabia, and Java. Arabic is their sacred language.","The Malays, like the Japanese, have a most rigid epistolary etiquette and set forms for letter writing. Letters must consist of six parts and are so highly elaborate that the scribes who indite them are almost looked upon as litterateurs.","One of the most marvelous features of Canton is the city of house boats, floating and stationary, in which about a quarter of a million people live and, it may with truth be added, are born and die. This population is quite distinct in race from the land population of Canton, which looks down upon it as a pariah and alien caste.","In Japan, the people preserve their temples for their exquisite beauty, and there are a great many sincere Buddhists; but China is irreligious: a nation of atheists or agnostics, or slaves of impious superstitions. In an extended tramp among temples, I have not seen a single male worshiper or a thing to please the eye.","Malacca fascinates me more and more daily. There is, among other things, a mediaevalism about it. The noise of the modern world reaches it only in the faintest echoes; its sleep is almost dreamless. Its sensations seem to come out of books read in childhood.","Malacca is such a rest after the crowds of Japan and the noisy hurry of China! Its endless afternoon remains unbroken except by the dreamy, colored, slow-moving Malay life which passes below the hill. There is never any hurry or noise.","The cocoa-nut palm grows best near salt water, no matter how loose and sandy the soil is, and in these congenial circumstances needs neither manure nor care of any kind. It bends lovingly toward the sea and drops its ripe fruit into it."],"Isabella Blow":["I don't use a hat as a prop. I use it as a part of me.","Desire is the strongest human emotion - desire for a hat, desire for a dress; that's what drives people to buy and want things.","I want to be kissed by the people I love.","Fashion is a vampiric thing; it's the Hoover on your brain. That's why I wear the hats, to keep everyone away from me. They say, 'Oh, can I kiss you?' I say, 'No, thank you very much.'","Young designers don't grow on trees.","I'm a walking billboard. That's my pleasure."],"Isabella Lovin":["We are convinced that gender equality is the foundation of sustainable peace and development and that gender-based violence needs to be addressed head-on as part of the efforts to build peace.","Improved maternal health benefits the whole of society.","It should be self-evident that women have the right to make decisions about their own bodies. Yet throughout history, those in power - usually men - have tried to control women's bodies.","Every second minute, a woman or a girl dies in the world due to pregnancy.","Midwives not only save lives. They are also actors of social change.","President Donald Trump's decision to ban American aid to all organisations that in any way advocate women's right to abortions is very unfortunate. All experience shows that this kind of decision does not reduce the number of abortions; rather, it forces girls and women to revert to life-threatening procedures.","Sweden's development is based on the equal rights of men and women. We know that investments in gender equality and sexual and reproductive rights pay off.","The world need strong leadership for women's rights.","I am proud to represent the first explicitly feminist government in the world, and one that has been at the forefront of advocating for greater attention to women, peace, and security.","The impacts of climate change are almost immeasurable.","I think the reaction to the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Agreement has been rather overwhelming.","The targets we all agree on - every country in the world except the U.S., Nicaragua, and Syria - will have targets under the Paris Agreement. So everyone knows what the targets should be, and then we can have a difference of opinion on exactly how these emissions will be reduced.","The Green Climate Fund is very much a strategic building block in the architecture for financing sustainable development.","If you always have consciousness of gender equality at the heart of your policies, then you will have much more democratic, much more sustainable development.","Democracy is something you have to participate in."],"Isabella Rossellini":["True elegance for me is the manifestation of an independent mind.","I always have parmigiano-reggiano, olive oil and pasta at home. When people get sick, they want chicken soup; I want spaghetti with parmesan cheese, olive oil and a bit of lemon zest. It makes me feel better every time.","If we are completely honest with ourselves, everyone has a dark side to their personalities.","The reason of my life is not to be the most beautiful woman in the world.","Women who stay true to themselves are always more interesting and beautiful to me: women like Frida Kahlo, Georgia O'Keeffe and Anna Magnani - women who have style, chic, allure and elegance. They didn't submit to any standard of beauty - they defined it.","Maybe there's some kind of modeling that can be tedious, like catalogue modeling, but there's a kind of modeling, with runways or working with Richard Avedon, that's not very far from acting. Besides the fact that you don't have a partner to react to, the body language is the same.","By the time I was successful with covers of 'Vogue' and 'Harper's Bazaar' and 'Vanity Fair' and the Lancome contract, someone asked how old I was. They almost fainted when I said 33.","I always encourage women to let their individuality show by not covering up what they perceive as flaws. When I see a woman with the natural wrinkles of time on her face, I do not see the wrinkles at all, but when I see a woman trying to cover them up with too much foundation or concealer, all I see are her wrinkles.","If you look at most beauty advertisements, you would think that makeup is only for beautiful women in their early twenties.","My perfume, Manifesto, was based on the scent of basil.","I live in New York, and the only live animals you see are cockroaches, rats and pigeons, which I admire immensely. When I see an animal that thrives in the garbage, I feel relief; in our urban environment, other animals are dying out.","In America, they are paranoid about ruining the reputations of people once they are dead and cannot answer back. They have this fascination which to me seems cruel and morbid. I do not want any part of it.","One of the great issues in biology is the origin of altruism - of why you would do something for someone else that could hurt you - and Darwin posited that it might be rooted in maternal instinct, in sacrificing yourself for your children.","That is the great pleasure of working with great directors. You get to look at the world through many different prisms. I guess I love talent, whatever form it takes.","In interviews, the first question I get in America is always: 'What do you do to stay young?' I do nothing. I don't think aging is a problem. What irritates me a little is growing fatter. It irritates me that if I eat what I want to eat, it shows.","It took me a long time to be accepted as an actress, I think, because of the modeling and because of my mother.","I was always interested in animals, but when I was little, animal behavior was still a new science. It was available to become a veterinarian, it was available to study biology, but not specifically animal behavior. In the '60s, Jane Goodall was the founder of this new science.","As I grew older, I worked less as an actor and as a model, and I went back to what I had tried to do when I was young but wasn't really available. I'm so glad now to be in my sixties and to be able to go back to school.","Market research shows that older women like seeing older women in ads, and that younger women do, too - because they see them and are not frightened of growing older.","Mammals are very close to us, but bugs are strange. They're more mysterious and exotic.","I always dreamed when I was a little girl interested in animals that I would go live in Africa. Then I found out that you can look in your backyard, and you can do your own safari.","I loved modeling. I absolutely loved it. I was so happy to get the cover of 'Vogue' - 23 times. I keep each copy. I made more money as a model than as an actress or as a filmmaker. In monetary terms, beauty pays more than anything.","These same people seem to forget that mother also took a lot of chances with the type of roles she played.","Although Dorothy in Blue Velvet was humiliated and hurt by men, basically I could react to how she felt.","I am now at an age when they wanted me to play her mother.","I didn't want to become an actress because the competition with my mother would have been to much to live up to.","But I don't really see myself as a role model. I'm not a dictator, or someone who wants to be adored!","I am much more radical in my beliefs than my products represent me to be.","A lot of the advertisement is done by saying: first of all, have a complex about who you are.","I like to extend myself as an actress and David really helped me.","There is this idea that you have to play heroines or women who succeed.","But my mother loved The Elephant Man, and my father gave David Lynch a scholarship to study in Rome.","When David left me I became totally brokenhearted.","The red carpet has become like a parallel business. The next day, there are TV programmes, and magazines, and it's all, 'Do you like the dress or not like the dress?' and 'Did she look fat?' To keep borrowing dresses and jewellery is like a full-time job. And you have to be a fantasy, which you can never be, so you always feel depressed.","To be an icon is a big job - it's beyond acting. And sometimes it pays, and sometimes it doesn't.","When I grew up in Italy in the 1950s, it was still very agricultural. Food was very important; produce was very important. Everyone made their own olive oil. It took me a long time after I moved here to understand that Americans are much further away from their food.","I live my everyday life as a person, and I react to my photos from a certain distance. When I look at a photo, I detach myself and look at it as a product - not as me, Isabella.","I don't wear much makeup, except during work. I felt lucky to be chosen to be a model. I used to joke, 'The next best thing to winning the lottery is having a beauty contract.'","I'm always a little worried when people have met me in person because I'm worried they'll be disappointed.","It always amazed me that people believed I was this beautiful object.","Ever since I was a little girl, I have always loved animals and been fascinated with them.","You don't do an experimental film to become rich, so the people who are involved are involved because they enjoy the creative aspect of it.","I have the most fun writing and directing. And I always choose myself as the lead actor.","I would love to be a field biologist. I would love to do what Jane Goodall did, just totally immerse myself in the life of one specific species for years and study every aspect of its behavior until little by little, all of these patterns become clear. That would be great, but I don't know if I have it left in me.","I seldom look at myself to avoid any self-criticism.","I would like to be forgotten. What's so good about being remembered?","Animation translates well to a small screen. When you look at Walt Disney or Chuck Jones - you know, Bugs Bunny - there really isn't any difference if you watch on a very big screen or a computer screen.","I graduated from Academy of Fashion and Costume Design in Rome. At first, I thought I was going to be a costume designer for films, and then I ended up working in fashion - not as a designer, but mostly as a model.","I've always been an entertainer all my life; I come from a family of entertainers. I always made, very pretentiously, a comparison with Agatha Christie. Her inspiration was crime, and I'm sure she must have taken courses or read about crime, because it was the basis of her stories. But ultimately, it was her own fantasy.","Every time you work, it's a new film, and generally when you work with auteurs, people that write and direct their films, there's always an originality.","I wanted to make a film about my dad, a sort of love letter, and explain what I understood of his cinema, which was so utopian. I also wanted to give the sense of his cinema, because they have never been very big box-office, but they were very influential.","It's nice to go and be a guest on a television sitcom. It pays well; it's easy because generally it's a supporting role, so you go, you do two or three things, you're in touch with people there. They're widely popular, so they're seen by many people.","I'd love to meet Darwin. He caused such controversy over whether God created the earth in six days or whether we evolved over time. I'd love to discuss that with him - what a fantastic conversation!","Food is a big part of my culture, so everyone knows how to cook. When I came to America and asked a babysitter to softboil an egg for my son and she didn't know how, I was shocked.","My father's films are often very slow for the modern audiences, which are used to a lot of editing. It's the audience that watches the film instead of the director dictating the reaction he wants from you.","I always say that in my career as an actress, I've always worked with people like David Lynch or Guy Maddin or Peter Weir who are considered not mainstream directors and that could be because they are like my dad. They are pioneers, and pioneers, by definition, invent something new.","My films are comical films. They are made to laugh at. They are comical - and scientifically correct.","I was born with a love of animals, the same way I was born with brown hair. When I was a little girl in Rome, I always had pets, which I adored.","I grew up in a family of filmmakers, so I always wanted to make films about animals, especially comical films. Something about animals amuses me. And they have a great mystery. It's the same mystique some people might feel looking at the stars or the ocean.","I've had a lot of 'aha' moments, but the big 'aha' about growing older is the mental freedom.","I've always been interested in animal behavior, and I keep reading about it because it's so surprising all the time - so many things are happening around us that we neglect to look at. Part of the passion I have for biology is based on this wonderment.","I became an actress way into my 30s because I thought that I had to find my own way, and that's why I worked so much in modelling, until I realised that the differences between acting and modelling weren't that great. I always say that modelling is a little bit like being a silent actress.","Once I realised that my job as a model was to emote in front of the camera, I thought, 'Well now, I just have to add words, and I can do films.' But also, my success as a model made me more confident about becoming an actress because, just in case I failed, I thought, 'Well, you know, if I failed as an actress, I can do another job.'","When I was young, it was difficult to imagine entering a world where my parents succeeded so much and I could have risked failing. It would have felt much harder.","Most people divorce because one in the couple falls in love with someone else: it's a common cause of divorce. I still think that it's tinted - this is my opinion - with a veil of racism and American puritanism.","There are consequences with age, so you have to evolve. I've loved becoming a filmmaker. But I would love to continue modeling, and there isn't really any job for me. It's being marginalized - that's the sad part.","I don't look at 'Vogue' to ask what I'm going to wear. Because it's something on a body too young. I have to look at the social pages to see women my age. To see how Amanda Burden is dressed and say, 'Hmmm. Maybe I should try that.'","There is often a great disparity between a director's personal style and the movies he makes.","I am the daughter of Mr. Neo-realism: I should gravitate towards narrative simply told, character, the truth. And I do love those movies.","I think I was always interested in animals. If a man likes a woman, you know, he might discuss business, but there's a part of his brain that is looking at the girl coming in and checking the girls. I do the same with animals.","The problem with middle age, at least when it comes to modeling, is you seldom see a model who is past 27, 28. If they use anyone older, then it becomes automatically a 'personality' story.","The secret of using makeup for fashion is to have fun with it. When people see that you are playful, that's attractive. Sometimes people apply makeup because they have bags under their eyes or because they don't feel good, and that just reads 'insecure.'","If you see a person who's insecure and covers it up, it can be quite a problem. But the person who is insecure and shows you is quite appealing. They give you just the courage to drop your defenses.","I didn't think I was going to be an actress. Everybody in my family was in films, and they succeeded so much, I thought, 'It's better for me to do something else,' and they agreed.","I started modeling at 28. I'm 5-feet-7 1/2, and I never went on a diet. I followed what my doctor told me: 'It's good to have a little bit of fat. Your weight is fine. Don't go any lighter.'","I live in the country. I'm a bird-watcher, an oyster-raiser. You know, I'll do anything that - raise dogs for the blind as a volunteer.","There are so many spiders, and their rituals, their mating rituals, their courtship ritual, can be very, very different.","It's a new business for me to be a filmmaker.","I always loved experimenting in film.","When I was a teenager, I thought maybe I'll be a filmmaker, making film documentaries. My dream when I was a girl was I would be hired by 'National Geographic' or work with David Attenborough, but it didn't happen. I became a model.","I loved my career as a model, and that evolved into being an actress.","Animals are everywhere. Some are more romantic, like tigers and elephants and chimpanzees, and some are less romantic, like earthworms, but they are just as interesting.","I never really think about what I have to do to stick to my image. I just follow what I like to do. Sometimes it's glamorous, sometimes it's not.","People use mobile phones in this very distracting environment where you probably don't have time to watch a 30-minute film, but you might have time to look at a film for a minute and learn something you didn't expect while you walk on the streets.","I'd like this to become my principal activity: to make films about animals. Of course it's always interesting to model, but it depends who you are working with. I will continue to make acting, too, but I'm old - I'm getting tired of it.","I grew up in Italy, and our country is a country of great agriculture and food produce. It wasn't like I was urban and only knew about high-heeled shoes and purses and never knew where my eggs came from.","When I grew up, we always had our chickens, and we ate our eggs, and we ate our chickens. The family always had a pig, and we would kill it at Christmas and eat it for three or four months afterwards.","Many years in New York has made me urban, and I won't eat my chicken because I met him personally!","Before Darwin, our world was very religious. People saw altruism as something given by God for us to be good so that we could go to Paradise.","If a hamster has too many babies she knows she cannot carry, she not only abandons them, but she eats them. That means she doesn't have to go out and hunt for food for herself.","The first time I went to Hollywood, I was 25 years old. My background was mostly Italian.","I live in New York, but I am always delighted to come to Europe because I am European and grew up here until I was 20. I am not only Italian, I am partly Swedish. When my parents divorced, I was three years old and went to live in Paris... when I am offered a film in Europe, I come with great enthusiasm!"],"Isabelle Adjani":["I have no fear of being less beautiful, I've always been afraid of not being beautiful.","You protect your being when you love yourself better. That's the secret.","Nothingness not being nothing, nothingness being emptiness.","I'm a very secretive person. That's how I grew up. My father was very secretive.","There are people who never experience that, who remain closed until death, from fear of change.","Passion is all but soft, it's not tender, it's violence to which you get hooked by pleasure.","I think that we all carry the divine within us.","I think we have to get back the value of behavior that is consistent with being taught: that's to say, respecting teachers, listening, and not always expecting your opinion to take precedence.","I've learned that to expose yourself, to reveal yourself is a test of your humanness.","It's funny how people fantasise about your life sometimes. But it's so much quieter than they think.","I believe that when you work on yourself, you are attracted by different, more positive beings.","People tell me I'm doing all these intense women and that I should lighten up. Then I do a comedy that I'm not happy with, and I think, 'Let's go back to heavy, heart-breaking drama; it's so much more fun.'","The soul preserves beauty.","American hypocrisy consists of thinking that everything is serious; French hypocrisy is to think that nothing is serious.","I take risks, but I don't lose respect for my real self. Because what's going to happen afterwards? How are you going to get back? Is there going to be a train, or will it be after midnight and you can't go home again?","In love, one should simplify, choose persons worthy of their promises and leave them if they don't keep them.","You must take the risk to disclose yourself in order to become more real, more human. And even if the price is high.","Life has brought me work to do on myself these past two years.","There has already been the karmic work: that what life has transformed in me, this initiation brought on, of necessity, by trials.","I believe in angels, so it's simple.","To change, that is the most difficult thing to accomplish.","If I had not passed through trial - through passion, one could say - through these years so painful and so rich, I don't believe I could take on my life and my career as I do today.","Before, for me, peace could have been synonymous with boredom.","One believes that if nothing happens, one disappears. That is not true.","One can be emptied out and be filled up.","One is never ready for success. It consecrates and looses you at the same time.","To leave in search of yourself, of your real needs, is easier when you don't have to justify yourself to anyone, when there are not too many people bestowing you their attention.","I do not want to work to correspond to an image.","But no one frees himself from being in love in three days.","Passion surprises. One doesn't search it. It can happen to you tomorrow.","One can not love without opening oneself, and opening oneself, that's taking the risk of suffering. One does not have control.","My limits will be better marked. Both the limits I will set, and my own limits.","I don't think of it at the moment, but the roles that interest me are those of young people.","There has also been much love, joy, evidence of admiration, there has never been one without the other.","I'm in an agreeable state: busy, enthusiastic, curious.","I've suffered too much to hide my feelings.","Today I trust my instinct, I trust myself. Finally.","The newspapers were saying, 'You have AIDS.' They actually said I was dead. I just threw myself into my work when the whispering campaign turned really ugly.","I talked about the persecution of Algerians and told about racism in my childhood. And it was as if, after that, I wasn't French anymore.","I went on French television for 20 minutes. It was very embarrassing to have to say, 'I'm not dead. I'm well. I'm not ill, and I don't have AIDS.' I hated doing it, because it was so insulting to those who really did have AIDS.","I am a follower of hyaluronic acid - always in small doses, of course - to fill wrinkles and fine lines.","I've never felt like a French actress.","If I don't work very often, it's because what I read is written for formidable actresses, but actresses who make a habit of playing with their cup half full.","I like films that rest in the memory, so I try and choose parts which have some kind of social or emotional force.","For me, being an actress is not just a profession but a profession of faith.","Passion is very destructive.","It doesn't need to be that violent and crazy and wild. Having experienced it, you don't belong to yourself anymore. You belong to the passion... It's something you have to go through to learn what passion is about.","I like to go see films that give me courage and hope.","Simply, the majority of the most interesting filmmakers are the ones confronted with difficult situations. Their creativity blows a hole in the wall and lets in the light.","I'm a public figure. It's up to me to take the initiative to explain things. It's my responsibility.","We can't forbid women from going to the beach because of a costume, even if it is rightly seen as neo-fundamentalist, backward, and shocking.","I find the heated political debate over the burkini both ridiculous and dangerous.","Journalists are still inventing things that never existed about me. Before, it made me cry, but now I laugh about it.","If my life hadn't itself been a modern adaptation of 'Les Atrides,' I probably would never have left the theatre.","Someone who is an artist can say, 'I can create and can make what I create disappear.'","If you are in a gym class with other women, and even if you are in shape, you feel like, 'Do they think my legs are not right?' Since you are supposed to be the perfect one, they look for the defects. It's such an embarrassment.","I loved my freedom as an adolescent, and I'd love to be an adolescent again.","I have a lot of friends in Paris, and I love to get away from home.","Algeria keeps me awake at night. What about you?","When you hold a baby in your arms, you don't want to put it in a basket right away. You want to keep the baby close.","I like working emotions that can take you beyond your life. And yet you have to resist them in order remain within your life. Otherwise, you're burned. I like that fight. It's more of a fight with yourself.","For me to get up and feel the urge to go to the set and all that, I have to feel there is something tremendously vibrating to achieve there. I need to lose sometimes a consciousness of the person and the reality in order to be happy to come back into the reality and happier to live it for this cause, to be an artist in this life.","It's exhilarating to read something that tells you that people saw something and felt something that you thought was so discreet. When they relate you to some of their own fantasies of who or how some actresses should be in movies. That's really kind of sweet!","You have to believe yourself to be the centre of the world, or you believe nothing. You start to treat yourself very badly.","I took the test for AIDS. I began to hate people who were not sick. Those people are monsters, I would think, believing that they are well because of moral superiority, because they are good. I identified with the loneliness of the sick. I felt that there was something pure about them."],"Isabelle Eberhardt":["A nomad I will remain for life, in love with distant and uncharted places.","One must never look for happiness: one meets it by the way.","I am not afraid of death, but would not want to die in some obscure or pointless way."],"Isabelle Fuhrman":["Well, I'm still experimenting, trying to figure out my style. I'm trying lots of things from many designers including Christian Siriano.","I'm obsessed with Greek mythology. My favorite goddess is Artemis. She's strong and reminds me of Katniss, the heroine of 'The Hunger Games.'","I think it's a good idea to take samples and live with them a little. So far I'm liking Creed's Spring Flower. I think I'm going to make it my regular scent.","I'd love to play more challenging roles, characters that would stretch my comfort zone and imagination.","I really like Calvin Klein for his classic simplicity. I also think Prabal Gurung designs some great pieces that work well for me. My mom has such great style; she's my biggest influence.","I never let anyone pluck, including myself, unless my mom approves. She guards my eyebrows. She's like the eyebrow police!","I knit for Caps for Good - a charity that gives hats to Third World babies - while I watch movies with friends.","People pretend to know me when they don't. I feel uncomfortable when I feel like I don't remember someone.","One of my favorite authors, Garbrielle Zevin, she did a book called 'Elsewhere,' that is one of my favorites, and I think they're making that into a movie too. I really want to be in that one just because the story is so beautiful.","I really love the story in 'Twilight.'","Twilight' has a supernatural reference to it with werewolves and vampires. 'Harry Potter' has magic. 'The Hunger Games' is about real people put into extreme situations and circumstances.","Meryl Streep is awesome.","I really want to work with Emma Stone; she is adorable.","Now I want to work with Octavia Spencer, because I met her and she's really funny."],"Isabelle Holland":["As long as you don't forgive, who and whatever it is will occupy rent-free space in your mind.","Guilt is the price we pay willingly for doing what we are going to do anyway."],"Isabelle Huppert":["Acting is a way of living out one's insanity.","I like to take these unusual characters and then make them as normal as possible, because we all know that the tragedy and the abnormal always hides itself behind the normal.","The Greeks already understood that there was more interest in portraying an unusual character than a usual character - that is the purpose of films and theatre.","For an actress there is no greater gift than having a camera in front of you, listening to the most beautiful music in the world and just being looked at!","Perhaps Europeans are a bit more skeptic whereas Americans are more believers.","My mom's a Catholic, and my dad's a Jew, and they didn't want anything to do with anything.","Yes, he wanted me to do Funny Games before, which I didn't want to do because the film was very theoretical - the way people experience violence on screen. There was very little space for fiction, it was more like a sacrifice for the actors than anything else.","When you come to do the film, it is not the time to wonder why you do it. It's just how to do it.","Once you have made the decision to do the film, once you have identified the desire and all the deep and personal, intimate, artistic reasons why you want to do the film, then it's more a matter of how to do things.","It really helps you to go through difficult situations by just thinking about it as being a big amount of work which you have to solve how to do. For example, I don't feel very inspired when I act, I just act. That's it.","In a very complex way, things have improved in the dramatic field. Before you had the good and the bad and you couldn't mingle them. Now it's more ambiguous.","I think being an actress is more how to cope with the fact that you can't do anything else than to express a talent. It's a way of being untalented for anything.","I never wondered whether I should be a stage actress or a movie actress.","I don't know if you ever say to yourself that you want to be an actress. It eventually becomes a social function - you are an actress and you make a living out of it, but at the beginning it's more a matter of how to survive, or how to exist in a certain way.","I did a film very quickly, and then a lot of work for television, and then I did stage work.","Going through this musical experience really helped us to understand the core of the film.","For me, making films is like being on vacation, it's a nice walk. But theatre is like mountaineering. You never know whether you're going to fall off or make it to the top.","For a long time I have compared cinema to music, I think cinema has a lot to do with the rhythm of music.","Firstly I did it in this huge theatre in Avignon, then to smaller places, then bigger places. You have to change the volume of the voice, give more or less. The way you have to relate to space makes it like sculpture.","Even for the most difficult scenes, and there are difficult scenes in the film, and because Michael Haneke is such a great film-maker - I think a great film-maker is not only being inspired, but how to do it, how to make it as real as possible, knowing that it's not real.","But theatre is always a difficult experience.","But someone like Claude Chabrol tries to make a connection between the society in which we live and the social reasons which make monsters out of some people.","But on the whole, nothing requires unbearable energy for me, it's just a normal thing.","But it wasn't just a technical approach towards the piano, studying the music for this film was also a way of approaching the soul of the film, because the film is really about the soul of Schubert and the soul of Bach.","Before I do a play I say that I hope it's going to be for as short a time as possible but, once you do it, it is a paradoxical pleasure. One evening out of two there are five minutes of a miracle and for those five minutes you want to do it again and again. It's like a drug."],"Isabelle Kocher":["Renewable energy is an essential part of our strategy of decarbonization, decentralization, as well as digitalization of energy.","Women too often say to themselves, 'It's too difficult. I'm not going to get there.' I tell them: 'Listen: do not question your abilities. Dare to do what you want to do and realize that you can do it.'","I realize that every time we discuss a job placement and look at a list of both male and female candidates, there's a question that comes up pretty much all the time for the woman: 'Will she know how to assert herself?' It's not meant to be malicious. It's more, 'Will she manage to take leadership of the team you want to entrust to her?'","We need to replace coal with gas. We need to leave oil in the ground.","We need to create shareholder value. That is why I am here. That is what I need to do.","Whatever religion or wisdom, spirituality and values are important to me and to the business.","The promise of individual and collective emancipation implicit in the notion of progress appears to be broken.","Citizens and consumers are demanding that climate change and environmental issues be taken seriously.","Momentum is building for the creation of a shared future, one that is more egalitarian, inclusive, and respectful of the environment - a future that ultimately offers greater possibilities for personal development and control over our individual lives.","It turns out that the greatly underestimated downside of technological progress is a fractured world.","In France, we have a mania for meetings that start very early and finish very late. It wastes time and creates rigidity in schedules. Everyone knows I hate long meetings.","I have received so many letters, messages, emails, testimonies of women whom I meet in international conferences, wherever it may be, who tell me, 'It's great that you have balanced life and work so successfully.' I now think I have underestimated that, the 'role model' aspect of my life, I must say.","We all live such digital lives, there is no reason why we should not import this into our company.","Most of the energy consumed is for heating, cooling, and transport. By massively deploying green gas, we could decarbonize all that.","We will progressively make our gas greener so that by 2050 it can be 100 percent green."],"Isadora Duncan":["The dancer's body is simply the luminous manifestation of the soul.","You were once wild here. Don't let them tame you.","Any intelligent woman who reads the marriage contract, and then goes into it, deserves all the consequences.","So long as little children are allowed to suffer, there is no true love in this world.","With what price we pay for the glory of motherhood.","What one has not experienced, one will never understand in print.","We may not all break the Ten Commandments, but we are certainly all capable of it. Within us lurks the breaker of all laws, ready to spring out at the first real opportunity.","My motto - sans limites.","It seems to me monstrous that anyone should believe that the jazz rhythm expresses America. Jazz rhythm expresses the primitive savage.","The finest inheritance you can give to a child is to allow it to make its own way, completely on its own feet.","So that ends my first experience of matrimony, which I always thought a highly over-rated performance.","Most human beings today waste some 25 to 30 years of their lives before they break through the actual and conventional lies which surround them.","Art is not necessary at all. All that is necessary to make this world a better place to live in is to love - to love as Christ loved, as Buddha loved.","The real American type can never be a ballet dancer. The legs are too long, the body too supple and the spirit too free for this school of affected grace and toe walking.","It has taken me years of struggle, hard work and research to learn to make one simple gesture, and I know enough about the art of writing to realize that it would take as many years of concentrated effort to write one simple, beautiful sentence.","The first essential in writing about anything is that the writer should have no experience of the matter.","People don't live nowadays: they get about ten percent out of life.","Perhaps he was a bit different from other people, but what really sympathetic person is not a little mad?"],"Isaiah Berlin":["Liberty for wolves is death to the lambs.","To understand is to perceive patterns.","All forms of tampering with human beings, getting at them, shaping them against their will to your own pattern, all thought control and conditioning is, therefore, a denial of that in men which makes them men and their values ultimate.","The first people totalitarians destroy or silence are men of ideas and free minds.","The fundamental sense of freedom is freedom from chains, from imprisonment, from enslavement by others. The rest is extension of this sense, or else metaphor.","Philosophers are adults who persist in asking childish questions.","Injustice, poverty, slavery, ignorance - these may be cured by reform or revolution. But men do not live only by fighting evils. They live by positive goals, individual and collective, a vast variety of them, seldom predictable, at times incompatible.","Only barbarians are not curious about where they come from, how they came to be where they are, where they appear to be going, whether they wish to go there, and if so, why, and if not, why not.","Few new truths have ever won their way against the resistance of established ideas save by being overstated.","The very desire for guarantees that our values are eternal and secure in some objective heaven is perhaps only a craving for the certainties of childhood or the absolute values of our primitive past."],"Isaiah Mustafa":["I hope that my daughter grows up empowered and doesn't define herself by the way she looks but by qualities that make her a intelligent, strong and responsible woman.","When a girl finally texts me back, that ding on the phone is like an angel singing.","What is good hair? It can be anything to anyone. Good hair is healthy hair, whatever you perceive that to be.","I just like making people laugh.","I'm a ninja! I like swords and knives and stuff like that.","I'm OK with being the Old Spice Guy because before I was the Old Spice Guy I was the guy looking for work on his couch.","I've been acting since 2002, around about there.","I think commercials are something that everyone does to get out there and get a little bit of exposure, get their feet wet, and also pay the bills. So anytime you can be a part of a wonderful, fun commercial, that's just a bonus.","Listen, I'm a big fan of everything on NBC. When I think of comedy on TV, I really think of NBC.","You know, I stopped being competitive after I played football.","Writers sometimes write things for me and I like to see what they write because I want to see what their take on my delivery is or what they think that I can do with something. So I kind of leave that to them.","I played football, honestly, to get a scholarship.","I love acting. I love performing.","I like hanging out with people.","If you have the athletic ability, why waste it in one sport?","When it comes to me, I know what I can do and can't do.","I believe there's nothing I can't accomplish.","Who names themselves 'The Situation?' I do not take myself seriously like that - not in the least bit - that would be so pretentious.","I write short stories. I write every day.","People really love 'Madea' movies and get a kick out of them. They're phenomenally successful. People get excited when a new one's coming out.","I think an education is beneficial, but whether it takes an education to be successful in the arts is a whole other question.","Sorry, I'm not much of a cook.","I don't sit down and have meals too often, unless I go out for dinner.","I do date quite frequently.","Raising a daughter is hard work. There's no other way to describe it for me.","I'm just a normal guy.","If a woman is into me, it usually takes me awhile to figure that out. She has to hit me over the head with it.","I will always smell good.","I always feel at home doing a little bit of action."],"Isaiah Thomas":["My greatest gift that I have in life is basketball.","It's hard to get people to overcome the thought that they have to take care of themselves first. It's hard to get players to give in to the group and become selfless as opposed to selfish.","If all I'm remembered for is being a good basketball player, then I've done a bad job with the rest of my life.","I can't think of any NBA team over the last few years that lost three starters. And we replaced them basically with three guys who really haven't played in this league.","It was important to me to believe, because if I don't believe, how can I expect them to believe?","The biggest difference is in the leadership. It was better for us. We had more coaches and mentors to help us. A lot of the younger players today suffer from a lack of direction.","I've always believed no matter how many shots I miss, I'm going to make the next one.","You have to develop your whole game to completion.","It wasn't about the X's and the O's and the strategy; it was more about keeping 12 guys focused and committed to a task. That group dynamic, and then helping them to grow as people and basketball players.","Instead of me telling them what they need to work on, I wanted to hear from them what they needed to work on.","We were going to have to experiment, and we needed to develop our younger players. And a lot of the changes were because of injuries. But that's where I give a lot of credit to the group in terms of being able to maintain things.","Larry Brown thought Steve Francis was a Larry Brown type of player.","I've been in pressure situations before. All my life it's been about pressure and having to get it done. Just because you say it publicly, it does not make me afraid of it or make me shy away from it.","We decided to either try trades or just go with older players. If you do that and let contracts expire you can be in the lottery for about four or five years and expect your fans to be patient.","The type of athletes we draft still need types of versatility on the defense side of the ball, run the offense. You should still be concerned on the offense side of the ball.","Most players in this league say they want consistency.","I'll continue to try to make changes to better improve the team.","I love what I'm doing.","You're always at war with the guy on the other bench. You pick up their patterns. That's what I got the most out of this year. I know what other coaches like to do.","We decided to go the way of trading and getting younger players.","My thought has always been completion. Maybe you have to rebound better, shoot better, hit free throws, handle the ball, defend better. You have to do all those things in the course of a game.","My first choice was to work it out with Larry Brown. I needed Larry and I gave him 50 million bucks. This is a situation that I'm in and I'll handle it and I'll make it work.","I would still like to get more athletic and have players that can really cover what's going on in the game.","I want to see if the player communicates with his teammates and how he responds to coaching. Another thing to remember is players' bodies can develop better than their skills.","I believe in the players and what I've put together and we'll make it work.","How can I tell the eighth or ninth man on the team that I want you to work hard every day and I want you to improve and get better, but while you're doing that you're not going to get any minutes?","Everybody wants to be perfect.","All of those things had been talked about, suggested, rumored, as a manager and as a member of the Knicks organization, I couldn't allow myself to think that way or believe that.","It's been made clear to all of us that a player should never leave the playing field and go into the stands."],"Isaiah Washington":["Everything is not black-and-white. I'm really interested in the gray area - not justifying it, not glorifying it, not condoning it, but at least having people see there's a genesis for every event in our lives. There's some divine order to it, whether it's ugly or beautiful.","I'm no longer going to play thugs or debauched cops that I can't possibly make complex characters. I'm bigger than that. I owe too much to too many good people at the Goodman, Arena and Playwrights Horizons.","I love Facebook. I could brush my teeth with Facebook.","Even if I'm playing a bad guy, I work hard to make him multi-leveled and interesting.","I am not homophobic - in no way, shape or form.","Not just art for art's sake, but I want to have films out there that will provoke authentic, holistic conversations about the human condition. And not provide the easy answers, but put it out there.","I'm a human being first and foremost, and I have something to say that I think is worthwhile. 'Blue Caprice' is just the second installment of so much more coming.","The whole time I was on 'Grey's,' I'm still reconciling myself to my 11-year-old son, because he never saw me during that time. By the time he got up, he'd see a dent in his pillow, but by the time I got home, he was already asleep. So for three years, he had a daddy that he never saw because I had to work.","Humanity is in my heart. Do I suffer fools? No. Am I a stickler for my profession? Yes. I am a task master? Yes. My military background, football background, I'm a team player all the way, and I love winning.","I didn't know what gay was until I lived in New York for 10 years. You know, I was just underexposed in that regard.","I've written a book; I've become a better husband and father because I'm home every day. My connection to the Hollywood world has only been through Facebook.","The average person in Hollywood just assumes that if you're on a hit TV show, then that's the first thing you've ever done.","I'm proud to say that I was that guy playing the character of Dr. Burke on 'Grey's Anatomy.'","I only became an actor to get your attention, to challenge the archetype of an African American male; I can't be anything else in this lifetime than an African American man.","Not only our political system is broken, but how we do business and have public discourse with one another. The system in Hollywood, specifically, is not depicting people of color; we're not even talking about Asian Americans or Latino Americans; we're not even getting into that question.","I hate the term 'black' because it doesn't bring to life who we are as a people. The term 'black' has more negative synonyms than the term white.","It's, like, bigots want to embrace me, and I politely take their arms from around my neck. I don't share their views - never have.","I've been so incredibly blessed. I've worked with some of the greatest professionals in town. I stood at the Golden Globes.","Whatever I'm throwing out there in my work, you either catch that detail because you're ready to catch it, but if you're not, that's OK - you're still being entertained.","I would still work with Mel Gibson! He's talented, man! Come on, he came up with 'Apocalypto,' man! I want to work with this guy. I've worked with Steven Seagal. He's out of his mind. I mean, I've worked with Spike Lee for four films. I've worked with some people that you can say are right there teetering between genius and madness."],"Isak Dinesen":["The cure for anything is salt water: sweat, tears or the sea.","Difficult times have helped me to understand better than before, how infinitely rich and beautiful life is in every way, and that so many things that one goes worrying about are of no importance whatsoever.","When you have a great and difficult task, something perhaps almost impossible, if you only work a little at a time, every day a little, suddenly the work will finish itself.","Love, with very young people, is a heartless business. We drink at that age from thirst, or to get drunk; it is only later in life that we occupy ourselves with the individuality of our wine.","A great artist is never poor.","Who tells a finer tale than any of us. Silence does.","God made the world round so we would never be able to see too far down the road.","All sorrows can be borne if you put them into a story or tell a story about them.","I don't believe in evil, I believe only in horror. In nature there is no evil, only an abundance of horror: the plagues and the blights and the ants and the maggots.","I think it will be truly glorious when women become real people and have the whole world open to them."],"Isambard K. Brunel":["I am opposed to the laying down of rules or conditions to be observed in the construction of bridges lest the progress of improvement tomorrow might be embarrassed or shackled by recording or registering as law the prejudices or errors of today.","I am going to design... a Station after my own fancy; that is, with engineering roofs, etc."],"Isamu Akasaki":["I was overwhelmed by so many interviewers and then messages of congratulations. So many congratulation messages. I feel this shows the authority and the greatness of the Nobel Prize.","Very many researchers, including the front runners in gallium nitride, abandoned the development of gallium nitride-based devices. I have devoted myself to the study of crystal growth, aiming at the development of the p-n junction of gallium nitride.","In the late 1960s, red and the low green LEDs and the infrared semiconductor lasers had already been developed, but there was no prospect of practical blue light emitters, even in the '70s.","Japanese is a very strange foreign language for European people."],"Isco":["Madrid excites me. They are one of the best teams in the world.","It's great to have atmosphere at the stadium, but football is all about the players.","When I was a boy, the neighbours all knew who I was because I'd take a ball with me everywhere I went.","I'd say I'm a bit antimadridista although I do not know where my future will be, but it's a team that I never liked. I get the impression that it is an arrogant club, about how the players are. Without humility, you cannot get anywhere."],"Ishmael Beah":["I had a very simple, unremarkable and happy life. And I grew up in a very small town. And so my life was made up of, you know, in the morning going to the river to fetch water - no tap water, and no electricity - and, you know, bathing in the river, and then going to school, and playing soccer afterwards.","I believe in having a more open mind and including others who don't share your faith and having dialogue with them. And just having a pure heart and being a good person can bring you closer to God. Because once you believe in one particular religion fully and not others, that requires you to start disliking people who don't share your views.","Shakespeare is absolutely big in Africa. I guess he's big everywhere. Growing up, Shakespeare was the thing. You'd learn monologues and you'd recite them. And just like hip-hop, it made you feel like you knew how to speak English really well. You had a mastery of the English language to some extent.","I was one of those children forced into fighting at the age of 13, in my country Sierra Leone, a war that claimed the lives of my mother, father and two brothers. I know too well the emotional, psychological and physical burden that comes with being exposed to violence as a child or at any age for that matter.","My mother tongue, Mende, is very expressive, very figurative, and when I write, I always struggle to find the English equivalent of things that I really want to say in Mende. For example, in Mende, you wouldn't say 'night came suddenly'; you would say 'the sky rolled over and changed its sides.'","I grew up in Sierra Leone, in a small village where as a boy my imagination was sparked by the oral tradition of storytelling. At a very young age I learned the importance of telling stories - I saw that stories are the most potent way of seeing anything we encounter in our lives, and how we can deal with living.","A lot of people, when they say 'forgive and forget,' they think you completely wash your brain out and forget everything. That is not the concept. What I think is you forgive and you forget so you can transform your experiences, not necessarily forget them but transform them, so that they don't haunt you or handicap you or kill you.","We all find joy and radiance and a reason to move on even in the most dire of circumstances. Even in chaos and madness, there's still a beauty that comes from just the vibrancy of another human spirit.","We all have that capacity to lose our humanity when circumstances force us to do so. It's not specific to people who live in Africa or Latin America or Asia. And equally, we are capable of regaining ourselves.","In early 1993, when I was 12, I was separated from my family as the Sierra Leone civil war, which began two years earlier, came into my life.","Whenever I speak at the United Nations, UNICEF or elsewhere to raise awareness of the continual and rampant recruitment of children in wars around the world, I come to realize that I still do not fully understand how I could have possibly survived the civil war in my country, Sierra Leone.","I guess what I'd like to say is that people in Sierra Leone are human beings, just like Americans. They want to send their kids to school; they want to live in peace; they want to have their basic rights of life just like everyone else. I think we all owe an obligation to support people who want to do that.","As a kid in Africa, you were so connected to nature itself because you went farming, watched the moon out at night, observed how the sky was different, and how the birds chanted different songs in the evening and the morning.","The places I come from have such rich languages, such a variety of expression. In Sierra Leone we have about fifteen languages and three dialects. I grew up speaking about seven of them.","There's so much focus and interest about what happens during war, but very little about what happens when people return to homes and communities that have been destroyed. There's a renewal that happens, but it's a very difficult one.","What happens in the context of war is that, in order for you to make a child into a killer, you destroy everything that they know, which is what happened to me and my town. My family was killed, all of my family, so I had nothing.","I had gone to a talent show - I was interested in American hip-hop music - with my older brother, to another town, and my town was attacked. I went from having an entire family to the next minute not having anything. It was very painful.","I grew up as a Muslim. I went to an Islamic elementary school. Most of my community was Muslim, so I grew up praying five times a day.","I believe that there is a God, and coming from an African tradition, I believe also that there are gods.","After I wrote my memoir, 'A Long Way Gone,' I was a bit exhausted. I didn't want to write another memoir; I felt that it might not be sane for one to speak about himself for many, many, many years in a row. At the same time, I felt the story of 'Radiance of Tomorrow' pulling at me because of the first book.","The thing that really gets to me is that countries are in the news only when things get out of hand. That's when it's newsworthy. When the war ends, it's not newsworthy anymore; no one wants to think about it. Actually, the aftermath is the most important part. It's when people have to rebuild.","As a child soldier, your rights are constantly violated.","For many observers, a child who has known nothing but war, a child for whom the Kalashnikov is the only way to make a living and for whom the bush is the most welcoming community, is a child lost forever for peace and development. I contest this view. For the sake of these children, it is essential to prove that another life is possible.","It's exhausting writing nonfiction, particularly when it's personal. It's tiring, always speaking about things that are not necessarily fun retelling."],"Ishmael Reed":["I finally had to go to the American Civil Liberties Union here in northern California to get my reply published to what I considered to be a hatchet job done by Stanley Crouch.","I'm sure that you could go back and make a graph showing that all the killings of black males increased in times of economic difficulty. As a matter of fact, a black man was lynched last year.","That kind of thing happens to black people every day in this country, and they don't receive that kind of sentence he did, which was to go to prison on the weekends; I think he lectured there-an outside lecturer.","Free enterprise is not a bad idea and has produced art.","Ethnic life in the United States has become a sort of contest like baseball in which the blacks are always the Chicago Cubs.","I used to be a discipline problem, which caused me embarrassment until I realized that being a discipline problem in a racist society is sometimes an honor.","Writing poetry is the hard manual labor of the imagination."],"Isiah Whitlock, Jr.":["I'm a winemaker and a wine collector, so I usually just drink wine.","I always figure, you come to a party, you gotta know somebody. And somebody leads to another person and leads to somebody else, somebody else. That's one of things that I really enjoy doing.","Usually, when you're working or you're on set, everything is very guarded. At parties, people have a tendency to relax.","I don't stay out that late. I never really stay out that late. I used to, and after a while you begin to realize that a little sleep works wonders, you know?","When I went to San Francisco for the first time in 1975, I went there for a summer, this acting training program for three months in the summer - I've never been the same."],"Iskra Lawrence":["Everybody can rock a bikini, swimsuit, unicorn onesie... whatever floats your boat. If you wear it with confidence, you will look hot.","There's nothing wrong with having a bad day. Let yourself feel those emotions because every emotion is validated.","Hateful words stand no chance against self-worth and a little of humor.","I live by 'Everything in moderation.'","I felt like the sample size was right, and my body was wrong. I basically ended up going into battle with my body, and that's a daily battle every time you look in the mirror. Every time you see an image of a successful model or someone who you look up to who doesn't look like you, you think you're not good enough.","If you want to wear something and you feel confident, you are going to rock it. That's what I love about fashion: it's your choice and your chance to express yourself.","My confidence comes from the realisation that, actually, the best you can be is you, learning to accept who I was, what I wanted, and that I was more than my body.","You don't always need to be this flawless female with amazing skin and done hair. Perfect doesn't exist.","I treat health and fitness as looking after myself.","A brand is only going to want to be more inclusive if they feel like it's going to be good for business as well as making the consumer feel good - so we have to encourage people to do that. Consumers have to stand up and say, 'I have power: my pound or dollar is how I vote.'","Girls shouldn't be worried about their cellulite or their rolls. Or anything that makes us real.","I feel like I deserve to be loved because I've learned to love myself.","Be you. Everyone else is already taken.","As a model, I feel a great responsibility, and I understand how an image can make a young woman feel.","For me, I feel empowered when I use my body to exercise, play sports, and explore the world. My body allows me to sing, dance, talk, feel - and eat a damn good piece of cheesecake.","I don't ever wanna blame my body for not being right.","I had a turbulent relationship with my calves, but I love them now because I realize that they were never the problem.","I dreamt of being an Aerie model before I came to New York. That was one of the main reasons I came to New York and wanted to get signed.","Any images that I've had retouched, I look at them, and I think, 'Oh I actually don't want that.' That's why I don't share them on Instagram.","I think unretouched images are even more beautiful.","I didn't always have a lot of self confidence growing up.","For so many years, I thought I wasn't good enough.","I tried the maple syrup diet. I tried the protein-only Atkins diet.","I had a taste for this fashion industry that I loved and wanted to be a part of.","I just spent five, six years sacrificing so much to try and fit into that one ideal, that one small standard, and I was never good enough. And it was just frustration that turned into motivation... That became my ammunition, all the people that told me I couldn't.","If you start talking to yourself in a loving way you're going to feel so much better, and your life is going to be so much happier.","You're always 'too' something.","I started when I was 13 years old by entering 'Elle Girl''s search for the next supermodel in the U.K. I got to the finals and was signed by Storm.","Instead of waking up and worrying about your thigh gap, wake up and worry about what you're going to achieve today. What can you do, and how can you give back?","We need to realize that we can do anything with our lives because of who we are.","Clothing for larger sizes doesn't have to look frumpy and old; it should seamlessly integrate fashion - like Universal Standard.","After so many years of being rejected and having my body scrutinized... for Aerie to come along and basically say, 'We accept you. We don't care about your size.' To see those pictures on a Times Square billboard, and they were completely unretouched, I just was like, 'Wow. I finally feel good enough!'","I remember doing a commercial one time where I stepped on a shard of glass, and I was hobbling around in swimwear. It was raining and in the commercial, when I saw it, I didn't look like I had a messed up foot.","Oh my goodness - Zac Efron has great abs.","Obviously, breast cancer is very much out there but cervical cancer isn't talked about as much because there's a bit more of a stigma around it. Certainly that's something I want to make sure that young girls know.","I think everyone who shares a piece of themselves and is open and honest - I think that helps us all.","Everyone has to realize that body-shaming can happen at any size.","The focus for me is always about health. That's why I talk about self-care rather than size or anything like that, because that's something we can all do that's relatable - this discussion of being healthy form the inside-out.","Invest in brands that make you feel good and that you believe in.","You can't compare yourself to anyone else. I try and use this advice daily. I didn't actually fully believe that until I was maybe 21 or 22.","No matter what age you are, your voice should be heard, and you can develop a passion for something and be an activist in your own right, in your own field, for something you feel strongly about.","I remember I took an editorial, and I was so excited. I got the pictures back, and I looked in the magazine, and I was like, 'Oh my gosh!' My arms were half their size, and I had a thigh gap magically, and all these crazy things. My family went out and tried to find my pictures in the magazines, but no one could recognize me.","We need to see real women's bodies.","My thighs are great!","I love McDonald's now and again - not every day.","When you're happy and at one with yourself and have come to peace with who you are, that radiates.","I never could have dreamt that I would be able to help girls feel better about themselves. But now I know I can. I want to do everything in my power to do more.","I'm happy with myself. I respect myself. And I know that no man, no jeans, no scale, and no booker is in control of my future - I am.","Every agency would mention my hips. I remember looking at the other models and thinking, 'I do not look like these girls.'","I was called 'fat' 200 times on shoots and had serious trouble fitting in the clothes at fashion shows. All these things break you down to a point where you look in the mirror and don't like what you see.","I remember Googling operations to make my calves slimmer, and I ate only ham for a week to try and become skinny.","My long-term dream is to have self-education in schools for mental, physical, and emotional health because we need to learn how to speak to ourselves in a loving way and to each other.","Change the conversation you're having in the mirror with yourself... if you hear someone who is saying something that is bringing them down, stop it. Don't be passive. Actually, take action and say, 'I wouldn't speak to my best friend like that.'","When I joined Instagram, I began sharing my raw photos along with my raw and honest thoughts and feelings.","People often ask me, 'Who is your role model?' and it sounds a bit cliche, but I've been trying to be my own model.","I've been trying to be the model that I wanted to see when I was a teenager, looking through magazines and not seeing myself, looking at pictures that were so edited.","I want to be the girl that's real and show other girls that you don't have to have flawless skin or the 'perfect' body - because that's just not real.","Throughout my whole teenage years, I had zero confidence and had to build it from the bottom up.","I'm very aware I have very young people following me - 11- and 12-year-olds. I want to do things that are aspirational, so I'm not going to pick a picture that's unattractive - even in the sense of lighting and angles - but I make sure that it's realistic. It is me, and it is my body. I wouldn't put anything out there that isn't real.","I'm very much a positive person - I put good energy out there - so I don't feel like anyone would want to do anything nasty to me.","I never want to shame anyone. I love going to the gym, and I feel proud and fit. That, for me, is aspirational. There are things you can do in a very healthy, natural way. This is how I work with my body to make it the best I can be. That's the shape that I have, just toned and tight. That's my preference.","Phones are interesting objects. Sometimes you wish they just didn't exist.","I need to just be Iskra, and I've got to believe in me, or else no one will.","You should be waking up and being excited about what you're going to do today, and your friends and your family, and what you're going to achieve in life.","I got told I wasn't good enough and that I could never make it. And then Aerie told me I was beautiful because I was me.","You don't need to be retouched - because the real you is beautiful.","I had had my own trials and tribulations with body image. I had gone through a lot starting from my teenage years.","Social media should be a true sense of who you are.","I always encourage other people to share a story and voices. That is so important.","When we think about our bodies, we often think about the way they look as opposed to what they accomplish for us every day.","It's easy to forget how powerful our bodies actually are.","I have heard every negative thing under the sun about my body.","Never think your life isn't good enough. You only have one, so enjoy every minute.","You are good enough as you, so delete that Facetune app and step away from that really weird filter that makes you look smoother than Craig David.","Words and images deeply impact the way we view our bodies, and the consequences can be very damaging.","When I was a teenager, a mean comment would have hurt me deeply, I've made it my mission to be a role model for young girls and boys and help show them that other people's words or opinions have nothing to do with how beautiful they actually are.","On a night out, I can feel unstoppable with an eyeliner wing and a bold lip. But I also love that I can still feel beautiful and confident without any of that.","I refuse to let something as insignificant as a size or number on a scale determine how I feel about myself. I am grateful for my body, my health, and the life that I have, and no arbitrary number should have any impact on that.","There is a way to disagree with someone, but it doesn't have to be threatening.","The most important relationship we have in our lives is the relationship we have with ourselves, and we're not taught about it.","I know, when I was younger, I would look in the mirror every single day and hate what I saw.","If your girlfriend is saying, 'Ugh, look at my stretch marks, look at my rolls,' don't say, 'Yeah, I hate my thighs, too.' Say, 'No, you look really cute today - and I feel good, too!'","I spent so many years being repeatedly rejected and told I wasn't good enough. It took a huge toll on my self-esteem until I realized I am more than my body and that, actually, our beauty comes from diversity.","We don't need to be categorized - we are all individual and beautifully unique.","If you are trying to achieve the 'perfect body' or aspiring to be like someone else, you are only going to feel like you failed.","My dad always has the best advice!","I did not label myself 'plus size.' The fashion industry did.","For me, health starts from the mind, and it really does start from the inside out.","My story is one of ups and downs. It's made up of tastes of success and a lot more rejection.","Like virtually all of the women I know, I spent my teenage years battling with my body and feeling I wasn't good enough. A lot of that negativity is because I was pursuing a career in modeling and was told countless times that my body was too big. My hips and thighs were too wide.","The more time I invested in myself and finding out what made me unique and special, the more jobs and campaigns I booked.","The first time I learned about Aerie, I was blown away by how beautiful and confident the models appeared in their ads - and more so that they were un-retouched.","When you get to that point where you don't have to worry and you don't have to think about it... I'm pretty sure that's the best diet you can be on.","There's a direct correlation between media and how we feel about our bodies.","Aerie builds you up, and it makes you feel positive. Why don't more companies do that?","Because I was a swimmer, I felt like sports did help me to realize that my body was more than what it just looked like... and if didn't eat, then I couldn't swim fast.","I was a 'straight-size' model from 13 to 16, but I was eventually dropped by the agency because my hips were too big.","Social media has been both damaging and beneficial in terms of how we view our bodies.","Labels make us feel worse about ourselves, and I would love for all models, no matter what their size, to be treated equally and called the same thing."],"Isla Fisher":["You can look in the mirror and find a million things wrong with yourself. Or you can look in the mirror and think, 'I feel good, I have my health, and I'm so blessed.' That's the way I choose to look at it.","I think there is nothing sexier than a handlebar moustache.","Growing up, there wasn't much emphasis on being nice or naughty. As a family, there wasn't much discipline. It was more relaxed at home, which I'm grateful for.","Being proud of who we are as people is more important than cutting into ourselves to create this false idea of beauty.","Women should not have to adopt masculine traits in order to succeed. You should be able to stay as a woman, and in tune with your femininity, and still be equal.","I love marriage. I think it's a wonderful institution and it's the most important decision you make.","Comedy has always been important in my family. If you got in a good joke at the dinner table, it meant more than almost anything else.","I'm definitely attracted to other Australians; I have a laid-back attitude to life that I feel is very Australian; I love a good barbie.","If I'm stuck in traffic or have a bad moment in my day, I go back to my yoga practice, and I breathe.","Being a mother is by far my greatest accomplishment.","I was raised as a tomboy with boys, and I never really feel like myself when I am really dolled up at premieres and showbiz events.","An easy way to get people to like you is to make them laugh.","Am I disappointed occasionally by the lack of irony in some movies? Yes.","I think all married couples tend to run things by each other in every capacity and we're not different to them.","You can't underestimate how traumatic divorce is for the children.","All I know is that I've ruled out wearing fairy wings. When I was nine I wanted to get married in fairy wings, and now I realize that's not cool anymore.","I crashed my boyfriend's birthday when I was 12 years old. He didn't invite me and so I showed up.","You know, motherhood is my favourite topic in my personal life and I won't shut up about it, but it's not something I want to discuss publicly just because of the amount of attention it draws to a small person who didn't choose to be exposed.","I love religions and find them fascinating, and I find Judaism very beautiful. It's enriched my life enormously.","When your parents divorce, it makes you grow up fast. I'd urge parents to strongly consider working things out. I'd work things out and I'd definitely stay put.","I never had the chutzpah to just come to L.A. and make it. I didn't have that confidence. I'm always surprised when I get a job.","Anytime anyone compliments me on my figure, I'm wearing my Spanx undies.","I'm not actually very good at the maintenance thing. I don't buff, exfoliate, pluck, rinse, moisturise, suck, bleach... whatever all those women do.","Women one hundred percent support each other in the movie industry.","I went to something like six different schools before the age of 12, so I was always the new girl and had to make friends quickly. It was difficult at the start because I was very bookish - I was literally sat in the corner reading books, with no friends.","You have to list all your special skills on a form when you get an agent. There's fencing, stage combat, horse riding, motorbike riding, Spanish, French, German, whatever. I just ticked everything. I talk about 10 languages according to that form. I even ticked the extreme sports box.","I breastfed both my kids for two years so, you know it was very tiring emotionally and physically.","You know, I didn't get to go to university because I've been acting since I was a kid.","When you're younger, being a redhead is... Well, my two brothers teased me no end.","I love acting, love it. It's the greatest fun in the world. I've never had trouble feeling extremely grateful.","Family is 100 per cent my top priority.","What I loved about breast-feeding was that bond of one-on-one time. The serotonin that's released calms you down and connects you to the baby.","I love to cook. But I'm a bit rubbish. I tend to start something and then dip into a book or have a conversation and come back and everything's burnt.","I tell my girlfriends - 'Imagine if all the time you put into waxing and primping, you took all of that energy and put it into something useful.'","In Hollywood, you feel a responsibility to look less disheveled than you are. But I'm a mom, and I'm not good at putting time into prepping.","I think audiences have always wanted to see women in the movies, but every time a movie like 'Bridesmaids' comes out, everyone says, 'Oh how funny, people do want to see women in the movies.'","After 'Wedding Crashers' I was just surprised as to the lack of comedic female material there is. So I had to start working and getting stuff out there for myself.","I think there is nothing sexier than laughter lines.","I love good food and I love to eat in nice restaurants. I love Japanese food. I love Gordon Ramsay in London; he is pretty amazing.","I don't like junk food, just because I don't like the taste of it, but I don't go to the gym - ever.","I find weddings really boring. They give speeches, your aunt kisses you on the cheek, and you're at a boring table. But it's different when it's your own.","I do consider myself to be a feminist.","I love 'Monty Python,' 'Black Adder,' 'Fawlty Towers.' I'm a huge fan of British comedy.","When you shoot an independent movie you have a very limited amount of time, and you don't want to be that actor, when a poor director is trying to get through a movie, that you're asking at every second to discuss performance.","I've never been a method actress; I've never been that person that wants to imagine horrible things happening in your own life in order to exploit them for your emotional being in the movie. I'm just not good at doing that.","The most romantic thing a guy has ever done for me is starting a family. That's as romantic as it gets.","I don't really watch many heist movies. Actually, I have quite eclectic tastes, but I tend to watch just foreign films. I don't know why that is. I'm not particularly deep or anything, I just like foreign movies.","I've had no helping hand in Hollywood. But in general, I've found that when it comes to getting jobs, what's meant for you can't pass you by.","I auditioned for a movie recently, and when I went in, the producer said he'd told one of its stars, Naomi Watts, that he was auditioning me, and she'd said, 'She's so funny; she's a great actress - you should hire her.' What a lovely, kind, and supportive thing to do for another woman.","It's a myth that you can have it all. You can't, but more importantly, I don't think you should want to. It sounds exhausting!","I've auditioned so many times and been told I'm 'not sporty enough' or I'm 'not sexy.'","I love Monty Python, Black Adder, Fawlty Towers. I'm a huge fan of British comedy.","I gained 65 pounds with my first baby and 70 with my second. I had severe morning sickness both times, so I mostly ate supersize bowls of white pasta with loads of butter and cheese because that was the only thing that took away the nausea.","My mother worked when I was growing up, so I was under the impression I'd find it easy to be a working mum. But I found it very hard to be away from my family, even for short periods of time.","I just don't want to miss anything in the lives of my children while they are still young. It's why I don't audition for leading roles at all and why I say no to some of the supporting roles that I do get offered.","I'm happy with the idea of being a mum first and an actress second - I'm perfectly content for people to think of me as a stay-at-home mum, rather than an actress, if that is their perception.","I don't think one should incentivise the losing of teeth. I find the idea of a child getting an iPad, or a £20 note, for losing a tooth, utterly abhorrent. Fifty pence, or a pound at most, is what my children can expect from the Tooth Fairy."],"Islom Karimov":["I say there is not more happiness for me than the freedom of my Homeland.","A person may rightfully be happy if in this life he could do a great favor for widows and orphans, could assist support than, and facilitate fate of people.","With the advent of spring and beginning of the new harvest season the creators of abundance, our peasants, come out to the fields to sow with good aspirations and hopes.","I'm proud, I've been working with this kind of self-sacrificing people like you.","May there always be peace, love and happiness in every house.","When there is life and mankind, a person will live striving for good deeds, liberty and a bright life, and wish that goodness and justice will reign in the world.","Your destiny is my destiny. Your happiness is my happiness."],"Ismail Haniyeh":["Some people think that the truth can be hidden with a little cover-up and decoration. But as time goes by, what is true is revealed, and what is fake fades away.","We promise you that we will not cede a single part of Palestine, we will not cede Jerusalem, we will continue to fight and we will not lay down our arms.","I salute all the nations of the Arab Spring and I salute the heroic people of Syria who are striving for freedom, democracy and reform.","Anybody who asks for democracy to be introduced should respect the results of democracy.","We repeat today that we are with the establishment of a Palestinian state on any liberated part of Palestinian land that is agreed upon by the Palestinian people, without recognizing Israel or conceding any inch of historical Palestine.","We came to say, the Quran is our constitution, we are committed to God and his holy book. God willing, should they try to carry out their crime against the Quran, God will tear their state apart and they will become God's lesson to anyone who tries to desecrate the holy book.","Today three-quarters of the Palestinian people are displaced: there are 5 million Palestinian refugees throughout the world.","The Europeans and Americans have said the martyrdom operations are why Hamas has been put on the terrorist list. But now these operations have stopped. Did they then remove Hamas from the list of terrorist organisations? We do not launch wars. We are people resisting occupation.","When the Israeli leaders launched their expansionist war in June 1967 they never envisaged that 40 years later they would still be haunted by the consequences.","The Palestinian people do not beg the world for a state, and the state can't be created through decisions and initiatives. States liberate their land first and then the political body can be established.","In addition to removing our democratically elected government, Israel wants to sow dissent among Palestinians by claiming that there is a serious leadership rivalry among us. I am compelled to dispel this notion definitively.","I hope that Americans will give careful and well-informed thought to root causes and historical realities, in which case I think they will question why a supposedly 'legitimate' state such as Israel has had to conduct decades of war against a subject refugee population without ever achieving its goals.","Tens of thousands have been killed or wounded by the Israeli army since 1967. During 2006, the number of Palestinians killed reached 650. Since the beginning of the Israeli occupation in 1967, more than 650,000 Palestinians have been detained by Israel - about 40% of the male population.","The increasing mistrust between the Arab-Muslim peoples and the western world is rooted in the conflict in Palestine.","Getting rid of Bin Laden is good for the cause of peace worldwide but what counts is to overcome the discourse and the methods - the violent methods - that were created and encouraged by Bin Laden and others in the world.","The victory of Hamas is not only based on the corruption of the Palestinian Authority. Hamas has a vision and a program, and this is the reason why the Palestinian people chose Hamas. However, there is no doubt that the corruption helped Hamas's victory.","Which Israel should we recognize? The Israel of 1917; the Israel of 1936; the Israel of 1948; the Israel of 1956; or the Israel of 1967? Which borders and which Israel? Israel has to recognize first the Palestinian state and its borders and then we will know what we are talking about.","The liberals and free people of the world will not like to see the Palestinian people living under siege. We have received indications from the international community that they will not stop their aid.","I ask the American administration not to participate in any resolution that will double the suffering of the Palestinian people. I am convinced that the American people would not want to see the Palestinians suffer the way they do.","Israel no longer has allies in Egypt and in Tunisia, we are saying to the Zionist enemies that times have changed and that the time of the Arab Spring, the time of the revolution, of dignity and of pride has arrived.","We don't have a state, neither in Gaza nor in the West Bank. Gaza is under siege and the West Bank is occupied. What we have in the Gaza Strip is not a state, but rather a regime of an elected government. A Palestinian state will not be created at this time except in the territories of 1967.","We are pushing towards the dream of having our independent state with Jerusalem as its capital. If there is a real project that aims to resolve the Palestinian cause on establishing a Palestinian state on 1967 borders, under full Palestinian sovereignty, we will support it.","When I said a few weeks ago that our people would eat cooking oil and olives if necessary, I didn't mean that there really would be only oil and olives. What I meant was that our people have the necessary patience to endure the current difficult situation. Palestinians would rather do without certain food items than their national rights.","Every Palestinian family feels the effects of the international embargo. But the more the pressure on the government grows, the more support we receive, both from the Palestinian street and from the Arab and Islamic world.","I know that many in Europe are unhappy with their governments' policies toward the Palestinians.","Doesn't the world see the suffering of millions of Palestinians who have been living in exile around the world or in refugee camps for the past 60 years? No state, no home, no identity, no right to work. Doesn't the world see this injustice?"],"Ismail Kadare":["Dictatorship and authentic literature are incompatible... The writer is the natural enemy of dictatorship.","I thought for a long time about leaving Albania, but at the same time to play a role in its life.","Literature led me to freedom, not the other way round.","Having spent the greater part of my life under a Communist dictatorship, I am very familiar with the Bolshevik mentality according to which an author in general, and an eminent author in particular, is always guilty, and must be punished accordingly.","In antiquity, there were three regions in southern Europe: Greece, Rome, and Ilyria. Albanian is the only survivor of the Ilyrian languages. That is why it has always intrigued the great linguists of the past.","For me as a writer, Albanian is simply an extraordinary means of expression - rich, malleable, adaptable. As I have said in my latest novel, 'Spiritus,' it has modalities that exist only in classical Greek, which puts one in touch with the mentality of antiquity.","For a writer, personal freedom is not so important. It is not individual freedom that guarantees the greatness of literature; otherwise, writers in democratic countries would be superior to all others. Some of the greatest writers wrote under dictatorship - Shakespeare, Cervantes.","I first came across the script for 'Macbeth' between the ages of 11 and 12; it was the first book that shook my life. Because I did not yet understand that I could simply purchase it in a bookstore, I copied much of it by hand and took it home. My childhood imagination pushed me to feel like a co-author of the play.","In general, literature is a natural adversary of totalitarianism. Tyrannical governments all view literature in the same way: as their enemy. I lived for a long time in a totalitarian state, and I know firsthand that horror.","If I manage to write something that I consider good and valuable in a particular place, that spot automatically has a special aura for me. In Albania, there are two cities where I have written the majority of my work: Gjirokaster, my home city, and Tirana.","If you are a serious writer or just a normal one, in one way or another, you are writing in the service of freedom. All writers know, understand, or dream that their work will be in the service of freedom.","The founding father of Albanian literature is the nineteenth-century writer Naim Frasheri. Without having the greatness of Dante or Shakespeare, he is nonetheless the founder, the emblematic character. He wrote long epic poems, as well as lyrical poetry, to awaken the national consciousness of Albania.","The laws of literary creation are unique; they don't change, and they are the same for everyone everywhere. I mean that you can tell a story that covers three hours of human life or three centuries - it comes to the same thing. Each writer who creates something authentic in a natural way instinctively also creates the technique that suits him.","I work only in the morning from 10 to noon. I still write by hand. I interrupt my writing when I feel that I've discovered something beautiful or, on the contrary, when I feel discontent.","I consider I've had a good day when, among the lines I've written, I've produced from my innermost core what I call 'the appearance of the pearl.' That could refer to a discovery, a sense of harmonious cohesiveness, or something like that.","I am of the opinion that I am not a political writer, and, moreover, that as far as true literature is concerned, there actually are no political writers. I think that my writing is no more political than ancient Greek theatre. I would have become the writer I am in any political regime.","The great universal literature has always had a tragic relation with freedom. The Greeks renounced absolute freedom and imposed order on chaotic mythology, like a tyrant.","We cannot deny that 80 or even 90 percent of the spiritual treasures from the past 3,000 years have come from Europe. There is no other Greek theatre anywhere else in the world. There is no other Shakespeare, Dante or Cervantes.","For a writer, New York works well. Literary work is very elitist. I worked two hours a day, maximum, and the time after that was very agreeable. I walked a lot with pleasure. Those two hours augmented the day. I wrote more here than in Paris, an entire chapter of a new novel.","It is well known that in the Communist countries, and especially in my own, Albania, readers were often called upon to demonstrate their vigilance by detecting and denouncing the 'errors' of authors.","Guidebooks used to write the name of my city in two ways: Gjirokaster in Albanian, and Argyrokastron for foreigners. The classical-sounding name somehow gave it better credentials, because people in the Balkans famously exaggerate and often call their villages cities."],"Ismail Merchant":["Well, the musicals give emphasis to love, longing, melancholy, sadness. All of that is always there.","A few words of Hindi appear here or there, but it's all Urdu. I feel that if the popular culture, which is what Hindi films are, uses Urdu, it's not going to diminish.","Urdu can not die out because it has very strong roots in Persia. The language itself is not only just the language of the Muslims, but it's also the language of the Hindus.","We have gotten some terrible reviews at times but if we depended on the judgment of the studios or critics, we never would have made more than one movie.","I feel very proud that we have managed to stay together. In these forty years we have made forty-six films. Each one has brought a certain name and contribution to cinema.","It's about a father and daughter and the daughter's friend and her relationship with her current husband.","It's about a young man who has climbed to fame and he discovers that his writing and the relationship with his wife are really more important for him than anything else.","The mixture of the Trinidadian people and the Indian people has caused a new culture to emerge.","This is one of his most human and most amusing and witty novels. The characters are very Indian. I decided that I wanted to do a comedy, so this was just the right one.","Well, I am from India and I wanted to make films in English for the international market in India. So that was really the main thing, and then of course economically it was cheaper to make films in India."],"Isobelle Carmody":["I believe excellent fantasy reflects us all, and yes, it can use those myths that underpin societies, our subconscious yearnings and longings, and perhaps our barren spirituality.","The thing is, fairytales were once a very gritty way for people to dialogue about aspects of life.","I have never forgotten the almost mystical power over an audience a storyteller has, when the story is deep and links you.","Once upon a time, if you wanted to talk about the notion of child abandonment, of a mother not being a good mother, that's built into the mother who sends the babes into the woods, and they use the bits of bread or stones to come home again.","I don't believe in fairies floating around, and I don't believe in telepathy, but there are things I want to say that just simple real-life stories don't let me say.","Isn't that what writing is about? The constant attempt to understand the world?","I am very fortunate in that I have spent pretty much my whole life being a writer, and before I was a writer, I was a storyteller.","I wrote my first full book when I was fourteen, and that was 'Obernewtyn.' It was also the first book I had published. It was accepted by the first publisher I sent it to, and it was short listed for Children's Book of the Year in the older readers category in Australia.","If you look at the body of any writers' work, you can figure out the questions that animate them. I think that is what real writers do. They don't tell people how to live or what to think. They write in order to try to answer their own deepest questions.","All through university years, I used to come up to Melbourne, go to Pizza Napoli with my friends and then to a movie.","I do see, in some younger writers, elements and things that I have used - and I am very touched and flattered because I am part of a tapestry that is being absorbed by authors.","The best fantasy does not offer an answer to our lives, it is an offering that acknowledges enough of the truth to resonate and add to the understanding about the human condition.","If fantasy is done well, it has both serious content in a literary fashion and is a really good read as well - and children and young adults won't suffer anything else.","First and foremost, I'm an oral storyteller - I'll make a poetic choice over a grammatical choice every single time.","What's gratifying is that it's my books that are being read and reread until they're battered over the years. I love that.","The first audience that you have when writing a book is you.","The best books arise from some ultimate question in the author."],"Isom Innis":["On 'Sid & Nancy,' it was originally this atonal kind of beat that you hear in the verses, like an atonal dance track.","Our songs, we construct them and deconstruct them so much, we kind of forget exactly what we contributed to them. They just start in a certain place, and then, all of a sudden, they finish, and OK, wow, that just happened.","I lived in Boston for four or five years and would commute to New York to play gigs. New York City became so expensive, all the recording studios started shutting down because they couldn't afford rent anymore.","2000's 'Donuts,' J Dilla - that's like the manual of hip hop production.","Growing up playing the drums, I idolised Questlove from an early age. 'Phrenology' was the first Roots record that I ever heard, and that was like my introduction to hip hop.","The music industry is more singles-driven, and the attention span of culture becomes shorter and shorter, but we still grew up in the era where buying an album, looking at the artwork, putting it on and listening to it top to bottom, those were the experiences that really changed our lives. That's what we aim to make.","When I listen to 'Workinonit' or 'Two Can Win' or 'Anti-American Graffiti,' it takes me to another place and gets me out of my head.","For us, an album is the highest art form - an album or a really incredible film. We're musicians, not filmmakers, so this is what we can do.","Songs are special. Songs are like trees. You plant these seeds and watch them grow, and you never know how people are going to respond. That's one of the most beautiful things about music."],"Isoroku Yamamoto":["I fear all we have done is to awaken a sleeping giant and fill him with a terrible resolve.","In the first six to twelve months of a war with the United States and Great Britain I will run wild and win victory upon victory. But then, if the war continues after that, I have no expectation of success.","I'm against war with the United States. But I am an officer of the Imperial Navy and a subject of His Majesty the Emperor.","The most important thing we have to do first of all in a war with the U.S., I firmly believe, is to fiercely attack and destroy the U.S. main fleet at the outset of the war so that the morale of the U.S. Navy and her people goes down to such an extent that it cannot be recovered.","To fight the United States is like fighting the whole world. But it has been decided. So I will fight the best I can.","People who don't gamble aren't worth talking to.","Should hostilities once break out between Japan and the United States, it is not enough that we take Guam and the Philippines, nor even Hawaii and San Francisco. We would have to march into Washington and sign the treaty in the White House.","If a war breaks out with the United States, the navy will have to put all its strength into interceptive operations, so... massive sea-borne supplies might be momentarily interrupted.","I felt from the start that America was not likely to relinquish lightly positions established at the cost of such sacrifices, and I pressed the view that a high degree of preparation and willingness to make sacrifices would be necessary on our side, but everybody here always persists in facile optimism until the very worst actually happens.","A military man can scarcely pride himself on having smitten a sleeping enemy; it is more a matter of shame, simply, for the one smitten.","Never tell anyone outside my staff that the Submarine Force and the First Air Fleet were responsible for the failure at Midway. The failure at Midway was mine.","Even though there wasn't much damage, it's a disgrace that the skies over the imperial capital should have been defiled without a single enemy plane being shot down. It provides a regrettably graphic illustration of the saying that a bungling attack is better than the most skillful defense.","Although a precise outlook on the international situation is hard for anyone to make, it is needless to say that now the time has come for the Navy, especially the Combined Fleet, to devote itself seriously to war preparations, training, and operational plans with a firm determination that a conflict with the U.S. and Great Britain is inevitable.","I entered the navy with the great ambition of becoming a naval soldier and going to war. Either I die from this festering wound - because I refuse to have my arm amputated - or I recover from it and continue being a soldier. I have a one-in-two chance, and I shall bet my life on it!","A man of real purpose puts his faith in himself always. Sometimes he refuses even to put his faith in the gods. So from time to time, he falls into error.","I sincerely desire to be appointed Commander in Chief of the air fleet to attack Pearl Harbor so that I may personally command that attack force.","It is like a disease to think that an invincible status has been achieved after being satisfied with the past successful operations.","As long as tides of war are in our favor, the United States will never stop fighting. As a consequence, the war will continue for several years, during which materiel will be exhausted, vessels and arms will be damaged, and they can be replaced only with great difficulties.","If we are to have a war with America, we will have no hope of winning unless the U.S. fleet in Hawaiian waters can be destroyed.","Unless more efforts based upon long-range planning are put into military preparations and operations, it will be very hard to win the final victory.","Anyone who has seen the auto factories in Detroit and the oil fields in Texas knows that Japan lacks the national power for a naval race with America.","Japan has always regarded the aircraft carrier as one of the most offensive of armaments.","The example afforded before the Great War by Germany - which, if only it had exercised forbearance for another five or ten years, would by now be unrivaled in Europe - suggests that the task facing us now is to build up our strength calmly and with circumspection.","Even a burglar hesitates to go back for more.","I was once the captain of Akagi, and it is with heartfelt regret that I must now order that she be sunk."],"Israel Broussard":["I think a lot of people get lost. They start following iconic figures and get drowned in the pool of celebrity. Our society, as we know it, is definitely changing. With social media and cell phones, you freak out when you don't know what's going on.","I still don't think I'm a good actor. The only reason I'm doing it is because I've got a lot of support behind me.","I wanted to be a musician, either a guitarist or a drummer. I guess my dreams were in the entertainment industry, and I landed somewhere along there.","I'm the type to over-analyze everything. If I was to rob a house, I'd have a checklist to make sure nothing goes wrong.","Actually, I wanted to be a musician, either a guitarist or a drummer. I guess my dreams were in the entertainment industry, and I landed somewhere along there.","Our generation, unfortunately, is stuck to our phones - and, like, Twitter - constantly, which I have no problem with. I'd say we're not describing the children of America or anything like that, but there is something to take from it: It is kind of sad how we can't go thirty minutes without checking our phone.","Acting - I'm good at it, but it's not my passion. Music, I'm not as good at, but that's my passion. I think I'm just going to go with the flow, wait until one picks up, and take the opportunities one at the time.","Back when I was in elementary school, I didn't have many friends.","I grew up in Mississippi. I was there for 13 years, and then when I turned 13, I moved out to L.A.","I was in elementary school in Mississippi, and when Katrina hit, my mom put me in home school. So ever since sixth grade, I've been home schooled, which was interesting.","I feel like I can be myself in L.A. I feel like Mississippi is a little close-minded; not all of Mississippi is, but just the part that I came from. They really don't get outsiders.","I grew up with three sisters, so I got used to being around them and all of their worries about fashion and what they are wearing.","I grew up in Mississippi, and there's no fashion game there. Even in 'Bling Ring,' I had to learn a lot about fashion - you know, the differences between lapels - and it wasn't until we'd wrapped that I really started getting into it.","I have a music video I was in coming out for M83 for their song 'Claudia Lewis.' It's directed by Bryce Dallas Howard, and I play opposite Lily Collins. It's a pretty edgy intergalactic music video.","Every once in the while I'll watch 'Duck Dynasty' and 'Kim & Kourtney Take Miami,' but outside of that, I don't really watch TV. Also, I don't text anybody, I'm hardly on Twitter or Instagram, and I'm very closed off. I'm kind of a hermit.","I want to create. I think that's the one word I can grow on.","Paris Hilton's house was pretty exciting.","Not everybody can say they wore heels in Paris Hilton's closet."],"Israel Horovitz":["Gloucester's not some chi-chi tourist town. It's a working-class seaport: a no-kidding-around down-and-dirty place.","You write a play mostly out of yourself. There's a need to get a certain thing down.","I grew up in Wakefield, Mass., and there were only a couple of Jewish families in the town.","I learned Hebrew from a high school teacher named Mr. Cohen. We would drive down the highway to meet his car, and Jewish boys from these Massachusetts towns would sit in his car and learn the lessons.","I've always been a fighter - it's always been a part of my personality.","My agent in London says all New York films are wonderful if they're really New York films because they're like travelogues.","I've done nothing with my life but write plays.","If work isn't rooted in comedy, people will turn from it, or they'll use it like soap opera.","I have a visceral response to a memory of working-class life.","People expect someone with the name 'Israel Horovitz' to be a little old man with sideburns carrying a Torah.","It's one of the terrors of old age that your body is not your friend. Or to be out on the street and be frightened of someone because you're not in good shape and can't do anything about it.","I am an internationally produced playwright.","Lou Tyrrell has created a theatre that is a safe haven for playwrights, a birthing center for new American writing. Arts Garage has created a vital, enthusiastic audience for theatre, music, painting and sculpture in Delray Beach.","I have never written a play, a story, a poem, or my one film - anything - unless something was troubling me enough, wrecking me, in fact, to drive me back into the absurdity of writing. I do not enjoy writing.","I'm really into the irony of writing vaguely radical plays that instantly win huge establishment awards. It's really amusing.","I write because I don't know how to ask my questions any other way.","Radical politics tend to be simple minded.","Maybe all theatre is going to be irrelevant for all time.","I parle Francais like a Spanish cow.","France is very welcoming to foreign writers.","I was not to the manor born.","I don't direct the plays of others.","My dream is to have a small company in France.","L.A. is so focused on TV and film that theater is kind of an arcane sport. People look at you like you're doing something cute.","I felt no need to write a German-bashing play.","The Holocaust story has been told and retold so many times.","Theatre's great. It's such an act of faith. It's a wonderful art form where you suspend disbelief for a couple of hours. It's a lovely art form because the actors and the audience are alive and in the room at the same time together. That's why I love the theatre.","I began coming to Paris in the 1960s when I was told audiences here liked my work. More than 20 of my plays have been produced in Paris, and several have had long runs and have returned in revivals.","I have seen dozens upon dozens of productions of 'Lebensraum' in dozens of languages around the globe.","It's not unusual for people to like Florida in the winter. I'm not a great tourist. I like coming down to work.","What Lou Tyrrell creates when he has a theater is a birthing center for new plays."],"Israel Kamakawiwo'ole":["Wherever you go, God be with you.","I guess this is gonna sound kind of weird, but I'm not scared for myself for dying. Because I believe all these places are temporary. This is just one shell. Because we Hawaiians live in both worlds.","I was scared when I lost my mother, my father, my brother, my sister.","I've seen it all, done it all, known it all."],"Israel Zangwill":["It takes two men to make one brother.","The only true love is love at first sight; second sight dispels it.","Selfishness is the only real atheism; aspiration, unselfishness, the only real religion.","Everything changes but change.","No, the real American has not yet arrived. He is only in the Crucible, I tell you - he will be the fusion of all races, perhaps the coming superman.","The Past: Our cradle, not our prison; there is danger as well as appeal in its glamour. The past is for inspiration, not imitation, for continuation, not repetition.","America is God's Crucible, the great Melting-Pot where all the races of Europe are melting and re-forming!","A man likes his wife to be just clever enough to appreciate his cleverness, and just stupid enough to admire it.","New York is the great stone desert.","Scratch the Christian and you find the pagan - spoiled.","No Jew was ever fool enough to turn Christian unless he was a clever man.","In how many lives does love really play a dominant part? The average taxpayer is no more capable of a 'grand passion' than of a grand opera."],"Issa Rae":["I thrive on obstacles. If I'm told that it can't be told, then I push harder.","The very definition of 'blackness' is as broad as that of 'whiteness,' yet we're seemingly always trying to find a specific, limited definition.","I don't think the mainstream media understands people of color are multidimensional. For some reason, there's an idea that only white people are relatable. I don't think it's necessarily racist. But it's odd, because the people who watch the most television are black women, so we should be represented in more ways.","Every time I'm recognized in public, I'm super grateful and appreciative, but I also get hot and nervous.","I never really had to put much thought into my race, and neither did anybody else. I knew I was black. I knew there was a history that accompanied my skin color, and my parents taught me to be proud of it. End of story.","The black characters on TV are the sidekicks, or they're insignificant. You could put all the black sidekicks on one show, and it would be the most boring, one-dimensional show ever. Even look at the black women on 'Community' and 'Parks and Recreation' - they are the archetype of the large black women on television. Snide and sassy.","I really want to be the black Tina Fey, where I just am able to produce my own content and produce other content for other minority filmmakers and put their voices on screen and basically be able to have free range to produce.","People are tired of mainstream media's limited and confined portrayal of people of color.","Black and awkward is the worst, because black people are stereotyped as being anything but awkward in mainstream media... Black people are always portrayed to be cool or overly dramatic, anything but awkward.","You know, even with the 'Awkward Black Girl' episodes, they come out once a month. That's great for me, it's comfortable, it gives each time to digest, time for new people to get on to it and caught up, but oftentimes I have people who are almost demanding a higher output from me.","You know, you have a lot of people - I've met a lot of people in the past, I've gone to private schools, you know, encountered different people who think that it's OK to make comments, insensitive comments about your race because they're joking. And think that if they're joking and they say it, you know, good-naturedly, that things will fly.","It's a bit cliche, but you can't go wrong by writing what you know. Even if you're a horrible writer, your own knowledge and experience is unrivaled. Nobody knows what you know like you know what you know. The way you see things is pretty unique.","I think that television and the web are fusing anyway, so I think that ultimately whatever I do, I'm going to blend the two forms.","People are willing to support and watch web series as a legitimate form of entertainment.","Respectfully, 'Awkward Black Girl' was never meant to be politically correct. We poke fun at ignorance.","My first web series, 'Dorm Diaries,' was a realistic mockumentary about what it was like to be black at Stanford University. I'm black and I went to Stanford. Boom. Easy.","The web presents an opportunity to showcase any character your sick mind desires. Want to create a cross-dressing, deaf/mute, corrupt politician who has a soft spot for saving children? Go for it!","Part of the allure of watching characters on-screen is to be able to put yourself in his or her shoes or to be able to relate to what he or she is going through or what he or she is thinking.","I wouldn't be anywhere without the Internet.","There's so many, 'no, black people aren't like that' barriers in mainstream media.","I would love 'Awkward Black Girl' to be on television, with the right team of people who understand and get it. If 'Awkward Black Girl' could make it to HBO starring a dark-skinned black girl, that would be revolutionary.","Mainstream media has convinced people that black people aren't relatable. So when a Jewish person comes up to me and is all, 'Oh man, I love that one scene from Episode 3, I watch it over and over again,' I'm so happy. Because that's what I want.","Every black film feels like it's Tyler Perry, and that just needs to stop. But people seem to slowly be looking for what else is out there - 'Is there something else besides this type of humor?' 'I'm tired of seeing men in dresses.'","I don't like to be overexposed. Too many articles, too many tweets, too many posts, I just don't like that. But at the same time, we live in a culture where that's almost necessary. People want content and they want their stuff when they want it.","Who I was was not acceptable to black L.A. youth: the way I spoke and my sense of humor. Everybody else had relaxers and pressed hair. I wore my hair in an Afro puff. Nappy. The way I dressed. It was all about name brands at the time in L.A. I had no idea. All those things, I failed miserably at.","I used to love being the class clown. I loved to make jokes and make people laugh. There was a set of students who would find it funny. But the cool students were like, 'Eeew!'","Growing up as a young black girl in Potomac, Maryland was easy. I had a Rainbow Coalition of friends of all ethnicities, and we would carelessly skip around our elementary school like the powerless version of Captain Planet's Planeteers.","It's one thing when other African-Americans try to threaten my race card, but when people outside of my ethnicity have the audacity to question how 'down' I am because of the bleak, stereotypical picture pop culture has painted for me as a black woman? Unacceptable.","As a teenager, my blackness was also questioned by some of the life choices I made that weren't considered to be 'black' choices. For example, joining the swim team when it is a known fact that 'black folk don't swim'; or choosing to become a vegetarian when blacks clearly love chicken.","The Internet has provided small communities for racism online, and people feel free to do it. Ultimately, there should be some consequence - if you promote your racism online then there should be a consequence.","I'm a social media addict.","I think that just because the show is titled 'Awkward Black Girl' and it is a predominantly black cast doesn't mean that you shouldn't be able to relate to these people. We're all human beings. We all essentially go through the same things when it comes down to it, so I don't I think that should limit who watches it.","I hate to say it but I hate black humor. I feel like a Klan member saying it, but it's just not funny.","I'm transitioning to television and film, but ultimately, I want to have a stronger presence on the web and be able to curate the content that I want to see. To bring attention to other filmmakers and writers.","It was jarring to be berated for 'acting white' when I was placed in a predominantly black middle school in Southern California. I was also chubby, into boys who weren't into me, and tried too hard to fit into this 'blackness' I was supposed to be.","'Awkward Black Girl' is spreading to all the right people because of word of mouth and social networks. I'm so grateful.","I personally don't feel any pressure to make jokes about multiple baby-fathers and stereotypical black jokes, because one, that's just not my life, and two, I wouldn't even sound right talking about those things.","I'll stick to finding the funny in the ordinary because my life is pretty ordinary and so are the lives of my friends - and my friends are hilarious."],"Issey Miyake":["We yearn for the beautiful, the unknown, and the mysterious.","The purpose - where I start - is the idea of use. It is not recycling, it's reuse.","I love to be free to explore, research, and evolve.","Many people repeat the past. I'm not interested. I prefer evolution.","I do not create a fashionable aesthetic... I create a style based on life.","I am not sentimental about the past. I like to think about what is next.","There are no boundaries for what can be fabric.","With imagination and personal creativity, people who sew can design the way they look to suit themselves.","I always wanted to create clothing that was universal - easy to wear, to care for, and that was also beautiful. As such, I became interested in polyester, and its potential, from the beginning of my career.","When I close my eyes, I still see things no one should ever experience: a bright red light, the black cloud soon after, people running in every direction trying desperately to escape - I remember it all.","My fascination has been the space between cloth and the body, and using a two-dimensional element to clothe a three-dimensional form.","I did not want to be labelled 'the designer who survived the atomic bomb,' and therefore I have always avoided questions about Hiroshima.","Think of things that can be created, not destroyed, and that bring beauty and joy.","From the beginning I thought about working with the body in movement, the space between the body and clothes. I wanted the clothes to move when people moved. The clothes are also for people to dance or laugh.","All of my work stems from the simplest of ideas that go back to the earliest civilizations: making clothing from one piece of cloth. It is my touchstone.","Design is not for philosophy it's for life.","If Mr. Obama could walk across the Peace Bridge in Hiroshima - whose balustrades were designed by the Japanese-American sculptor Isamu Noguchi as a reminder both of his ties to East and West and of what humans do to one another out of hatred - it would be both a real and a symbolic step toward creating a world that knows no fear of nuclear threat.","Clothing is the closest thing to all humans.","The combination of human skills with technology will always be at the root of any solution to the future of making clothes.","I believe that all forms of creativity are related.","Even when I work with computers, with high technology, I always try to put in the touch of the hand.","If you look back throughout history from the ancient Egyptians onwards, most cultures started making clothing from a very basic premise: a single piece of cloth.","Everything is an experiment.","A-POC respects that there is a fine balance between the value of the human touch, which can be called artisanal, and the abilities of technology. I like to think of it as poesy and technology.","I suppose there are many, but I cannot imagine ever having a more perfect collaboration than that which Penn-san and I shared. It was based upon mutual trust, respect, and a desire to have our own work pushed to new places. And it always resulted in delight.","In the past, art was admired and revered from afar. Today, there is more of an interactive relationship between the art and the person who admires it.","Many people will say, well, clothes should be worn; but I think people can look at them in public, like seeing a film. I think museum exhibitions are very important.","I very much like dance and dancers.","I am not really interested in clothing as a conceptual art form.","Technology allows us to do many things, but it is always important to combine it with traditional handcrafts and, in fact, use technology to replicate dying arts so that they are not lost.","Our goals must be to find new, environmentally-friendly ways by which to continue the art of creation, to utilize our valuable human skills, and to make things that will bring joy.","I am most interested in people and the human form.","I try to be free. The women also must be free.","Boys have been wearing skirts for some time now. My three assistants wear mini skirts. They come to work on their motorcycles wearing mini skirts. The French saw the idea on the streets and have done it in better fabrics, and now everyone says, 'Ah!'","The future of fashion is light, durable clothes.","Design is a vital component to the enrichment of our everyday lives. Japan has a very rich history and culture of design, and I feel it is a very important dialogue to open and keep evolving.","Paul Poiret did wonderful things because he was so influenced by motifs, but Vionnet really understood the kimono and took the geometric idea to construct her clothes - and that brought such freedom into European clothes in the 1920s.","You see it in the many bouncing clothes that are not just pleats. To make them, two or three people twist them - twist, twist, twist the pleats, sometimes three or four persons twist together and put it all in the machine to cook it.","Well, what I'm doing is really clothing. I'm not doing sculpture.","We can also cut by heat - heat punch. And we also can cut by cold - extreme cold. When you cut with heat, it makes a mark. With cold, no mark. It depends on the fabric.","To be honest, I think we should find first the possibility to make it. Research is first - if you're not interested, you never can find something. Many things happen from forgotten machines - ones that are no longer used.","One of my assistants found this old German machine. It was originally used to make underwear. Like Chanel, who started with underwear fabric - jerseys - we used the machine that made underwear to make something else.","Of course there are many ways we can reuse something. We can dye it. We can cut it. We can change the buttons. Those are other ways to make it alive. But this is a new step to use anything - hats, socks, shirts. It's the first step in the process.","I started to work with cotton fabrics. I used cotton because it's easy to work with, to wash, to take care of, to wear if it's warm or cold. It's great. That was the start.","I sent 200, 300 of the clothes that I had made, and the dancers chose what they liked.","I have worked with several dance companies.","By the way, Marilyn Monroe was a size 14.","A great thing happening now in art is that artists are using the figure, the body, clothing, life.","Most of us feel some kind of uncertainty, with the population increasing and resources decreasing. We have to face these issues.","I've never been involved in any kind of political movement.","I was always interested in making clothing that is worn by people in the real world.","Indian clothes are usually tight.","We have to keep a very tight check on quality.","I make clothing, and I don't care about trendy things.","I respect men and women who age and are proud and don't lose energy. I think fashion forgot those people.","Paris is an old and traditional place; it needs new blood.","The joining of the Japanese with the French should make a new movement. I think it should be good for Paris.","My design is no design.","I'd rather look to the future than to the past.","My generation in Japan lived in limbo. We dreamed between two worlds.","I realised I wanted to make clothing which was as universal as jeans and T-shirts.","Frank Gehry not only understood my sense of fun and adventure but also reciprocated it and translated that feeling into his work.","Architects always have a feel for time - the generation they live in - as we do, and they are always striving toward boundless adventure.","I became a fashion designer to make clothes for the people, not to be a top couturier in the French tradition.","A-POC unleashes the freedom of imagination. It's for people who are curious, who have inner energy - the energy of life and living.","Designers must be increasingly sensitive to our Earth's dwindling resources. It is our responsibility.","I am always looking to the future of making things.","In the Eighties, Japanese fashion designers brought a new type of creativity; they brought something Europe didn't have. There was a bit of a shock effect, but it probably helped the Europeans wake up to a new value.","I am neither a writer nor a theorist. For a person who creates things to utter too many words means to regulate himself - a frightening prospect.","When I first began working in Japan, I had to confront the Japanese people's excessive worship for foreign goods and the fixed idea of what clothes ought to be. I wanted to change the rigid formula of clothing that the Japanese followed.","In fashion, you need to present something new every six months, but it takes time to study things. Development is very important.","Men have been buying my women's coats for years.","The core spirit of Pleats Please is joy, and what better emotion to wear on your skin every day?","I tried never to be defined by my past.","I gravitated towards the field of clothing design, partly because it is a creative format that is modern and optimistic.","I never thought fashion was the job for me, because I'm Japanese. Clothes! That was a European, society thing.","Clothing has been called intimate architecture. We want to go beyond that.","My touchstone started out being - and is still - exploring the ways by which to make clothing from a single piece of cloth.","I am very interested in the culture of paper.","Indian paper is famous, Egyptian papyrus, Chinese paper... every country has used this natural material. But the problem is it's going to run out because it's very difficult work.","In Paris, we call the people who make clothing 'couturiers' - they develop new clothing items - but actually, the work of designing is to make something that works in real life.","The important thing is to make something. In reality, it's not important that a designer be known by name - you can remain anonymous. Even the status of a designer will undergo changes, I believe.","A few of the influences on my career so far have been Isamu Noguchi, Irving Penn, and seeing the riots of 1968 in Paris.","Retire? Never! We are far too busy!","Function alone does not make clothing appealing.","I like women who have their own idea of life: the woman who is assured, comfortable with herself, strong inside, proud of herself - not in an arrogant way, not showing off.","I feel it is urgently necessary to train people who are capable of tackling the various problems we face today in regards to environmental turmoil and the relevancy of clothing.","Clothes have become more personal, more a matter of very individual taste.","Clothes should fit comfortably - not too tightly - so that you have space to move in and think freely.","Polyester is easy to work with and results in clothing that is well suited to the needs of a modern lifestyle."],"Italo Calvino":["The more enlightened our houses are, the more their walls ooze ghosts.","In abortion, the person who is massacred, physically and morally, is the woman.","A quarter of America is a dramatic, tense, violent country, exploding with contradictions, full of brutal, physiological vitality, and that is the America that I have really loved and love. But a good half of it is a country of boredom, emptiness, monotony, brainless production, and brainless consumption, and this is the American inferno.","Without translation, I would be limited to the borders of my own country. The translator is my most important ally. He introduces me to the world.","A human being becomes human not through the casual convergence of certain biological conditions, but through an act of will and love on the part of other people.","In love, as in gluttony, pleasure is a matter of the utmost precision.","It is not the voice that commands the story; it is the ear.","I do not understand how you can associate abortion with an idea of hedonism or the good life.","A classic is a work which persists as a background noise even when a present that is totally incompatible with it holds sway.","Nature in America does not arouse powerful emotions in me.","Thoughtful lightness can make frivolity seem dull and heavy.","How much energy is wasted in Italy in trying to write the novel that obeys all the rules. The energy might have been useful to provide us with more modest, more genuine things, that had less pretensions: short stories, memoirs, notes, testimonials, or at any rate, books that are open, without a preconceived plan.","The writer is someone who tears himself to pieces in order to liberate his neighbor.","An exotic birthplace on its own is not informative of anything.","One writes fables in periods of oppression.","A tale is born from an image, and the image extends and creates a network of meanings that are always equivocal.","Biographical data, even those recorded in the public registers, are the most private things one has, and to declare them openly is rather like facing a psychoanalyst.","I detest this contemporary trend to destroy the traditional hierarchy of genres.","I do not have any political commitments anymore. I'm politically a total agnostic; I'm one of the few writers in Italy who refuses to be identified with a specific political party.","Although I am small, ugly and dirty, I am highly ambitious, and at the slightest flattery, I immediately start to strut like a turkey.","Folktales are real.","I suffer from everyday life.","When I'm writing a book, I prefer not to speak about it, because only when the book is finished can I try to understand what I've really done and to compare my intentions with the result.","Rarely does an interviewer ask questions you did not expect. I have given a lot of interviews, and I have concluded that the questions always look alike. I could always give the same answers.","Classics are books which, the more we think we know them through hearsay, the more original, unexpected, and innovative we find them when we actually read them.","What is modern art but the attempt to pinpoint vague, incorporeal, inexpressible sensations? What is modern art, I would add, but the most solemn pile of nonsense that ever appeared on Earth?","A classic is a book that has never finished saying what it has to say.","The catalogue of forms is endless: until every shape has found its city, new cities will continue to be born. When the forms exhaust their variety and come apart, the end of cities begins.","What Romantic terminology called genius or talent or inspiration is nothing other than finding the right road empirically, following one's nose, taking shortcuts.","The human race is a zone of living things that should be defined by tracing its confines.","Traveling, you realize that differences are lost: each city takes to resembling all cities, places exchange their form, order, distances, a shapeless dust cloud invades the continents.","The satirist is prevented by repulsion from gaining a better knowledge of the world he is attracted to, yet he is forced by attraction to concern himself with the world that repels him.","I'm terrified of writing at night, for then I can't sleep. So I start slowly, slowly writing in the morning and go on into the late afternoon.","Reading is a possession, a march toward a possession.","I'm afraid I don't think I really have a life on which something can be written.","I am more and more convinced that literature is made up of works, genres, schools, discussions, problems, collective work in order to solve certain problems.","I'm a Communist, fully convinced and dedicated to my cause.","I would very much like to be one of those writers who have something really clear in their head to say, and throughout their life they promote this idea in their works.","I think today that politics registers very late things which society manifests through other channels, and I feel that often politics distorts and mystifies reality.","Turin is a city which entices a writer towards vigor, linearity, style. It encourages logic, and through logic it opens the way towards madness.","My stories are full of facts; they have a beginning and an end. For that reason, they will never... occupy a place in contemporary literature.","The public figure of the writer, the writer-character, the 'personality-cult' of the author, are all becoming for me more and more intolerable in others, and consequently in myself.","Man is simply the best chance we know of that matter has had of providing itself with information about itself.","I change my method and field of reference from book to book because I can never believe in the same thing two times running.","I have spent more time with other people's books than with my own. I do not regret it.","I'm a regular guy; I like well-defined outlines. I'm old-fashioned, bourgeois.","I write... sonnets... and writing sonnets is boring. You have to find rhymes; you have to write hendecasyllables; so after a while, I get bored and my drawer is overflowing with unfinished short poems.","If the reader looks, I think he will find plenty of moral and political ideas in my stories.","Politics is marginal, but literature moves along by indirection.","For the critic, the author does not exist; only a certain number of writings exist.","I will revolutionise art and the world. Hurrah!","I was born in Cuba, and my parents were tropical agronomists.","My university work was not central to my education.","Every morning I tell myself, 'Today has to be productive' - and then something happens that prevents me from writing.","Every day I tell myself that reading newspapers is a waste of time, but then... I cannot do without them. They are like a drug.","Sometimes I try to concentrate on the story I would like to write, and I realize that what interests me is something else entirely, or, rather, not anything precise but everything that does not fit in what I ought to write.","New York is a fabled city, a fabulous city.","I feel so at home in New York that I don't have the urge to write about it.","Of course, I'm of the generation that grew up with Hemingway and Faulkner as strong influences.","In 'Cosmicomics,' I came close to science fiction - I was inspired by cosmological subjects and the workings of the universe and invented a character who was a sort of witness to everything that was happening inside the solar system.","I spend 12 hours a day reading on most days of the year.","Good literature can be created only with something that is different from literature.","I have never loved any writer as much as Hemingway.","I read Freud because I find him an excellent writer... a writer of police thrillers that can be followed with great passion.","I don't believe chance can play a role in my literature.","I write by hand, making many, many corrections. I would say I cross out more than I write. I have to hunt for words when I speak, and I have the same difficulty when writing.","I'm only a novelist on occasion. Many of my books are made up of brief texts collected together, short stories, or else they are books that have an overall structure but are composed of various texts.","Personally, I believe in fiction because the stories I like are those with a beginning and an end.","The Classics are those books which constitute a treasured experience for those who have read and loved them; but they remain just as rich an experience for those who reserve the chance to read them for when they are in the best condition to enjoy them.","A classic is a book which with each rereading offers as much of a sense of discovery as the first reading.","Writers divide into those who write biting their nails and those who don't. Some writers write licking their finger.","Now you mustn't think that I don't have any ideas for novels in my head. I've got ideas for ten novels in my head. But with every idea I have, I already foresee the wrong novels I would write, because I also have critical ideas in my head; I've got a full theory of the perfect novel, and that's what stumps me.","Every time I've had to do journalistic investigations, I've cursed, but later I discovered that it had helped me enormously with writing fiction. It's the one thing that can save me from becoming an academic writer.","Bringing a child into the world makes sense only if this child is wanted consciously and freely by its two parents. If it is not, then it is simply animal and criminal behavior."],"Itay Talgam":["A whole generation of veteran composers has never taken a stand or provided an example and has produced in the music academies generations of docile workers for the music industry. What can you expect from downtrodden workers who see music as a type of profession, like stenography, and not an act of creation that by its nature is subversive?","Whatever you do in life, there's content and form; only those two put together create special meaning of a great work of art or great interpretation of music or a great story that you tell.","Kleiber was the perfect dancer - so perfect that you could see the process. After all, dance is a process; it's a series of snapshots. Kleiber knew how to connect people to the flow, so he could stop managing people.","What is the source of power of musicians who are financially browbeaten, most of whom work for minimum wage or less? Musicians who cannot even afford to buy tickets to operas or concerts in which they themselves perform?","If school principals have given up on the important things and are focusing on discipline, they are creating a certain, diluted reality. In an organization that functions properly, discipline should be a marginal issue."],"Itzhak Perlman":["I have a very simple philosophy. One has to separate the abilities from the disabilities. The fact I cannot walk, that I need crutches or a scooter or whatever it is, has nothing to do with my playing the violin.","If you put your hand on the piano, you play a note. It's in tune. But if you put it on the violin, maybe it is, maybe it isn't. You have to figure it out.","Life is always full of challenges. I believe you're never happy unless you're consistently making challenges for yourself.","It is good medicine to go to a concert hall and forget the harshness of what's going on. It can be a very positive thing.","For every child prodigy that you know about, at least 50 potential ones have burned out before you even heard about them.","I don't feel that the conductor has real power. The orchestra has the power, and every member of it knows instantaneously if you're just beating time.","Every person with a disability is an individual.","One of the most important elements in teaching, conducting, and performing, all three, is listening.","I always find that there is a real communication between voice and violin.","The difference is that with Ebola, it is such a devastating disease, and there is still no cure. They're still working on vaccines. The fact of the matter with polio, there is a cure; there is a vaccine.","A lot of society tries to put people with disabilities into one cube, and when you think about it, many, many people have different types of disabilities, and you cannot put a code that applies to towards everyone - generally, they can be guidelines, but in the long run, interior designers and architects need more education on the subject.","Preparing for a future in music is an expensive proposition.","I'm now doing three things: concerts, conducting, and teaching, and they each support each other. I learn to see things from different perspectives and listen with different ears. The most important thing that you need to do is really listen.","When I came to the United States, I appeared on the Ed Sullivan Show as a 13-year-old, and I played a Mendelssohn Concerto, and it sounded like a talented 13-year-old with a lot of promise. But it did not sound like a finished product.","I'm an acoustical person.","Believe me, I've had interviews where the person says, 'So when did you start and why? What about your parents?' I say to them, 'Please, have you heard of the word 'Google?'","A talented child will have a schedule that is horrendous. You get up and practice, go to school, practice some more, eat dinner, and then you have homework.","My message is that giving is very important. Giving is a Jewish thing, and I like to talk about that. There's nothing more important, personally, for anybody than being able to give.","I actually wanted to play the violin before I had polio, and then afterwards, there was no reason not to.","There is no such thing as getting rid of nervousness.","Architects have to become more aware of exactly what is involved in designing barrier-free buildings and homes.","Everybody's saying, you know, 'You're so heroic and so on despite of the polio that you had and so on.' Look, I had polio when I was four. So when you're four years old, you know, you get used to things very, very quickly.","The most important thing to do is really listen.","A sponge has that much absorbent capability and after a while you can pour water over it and nothing stays.","In the musician, there is a tendency to have a narrowness. It's all compartmentalized. I am playing the violin; that's all I know, nothing else, no education, no nothing. You just practice every day.","If you put four different people on a podium conducting the same downbeat, you get four different sounds. It's a little mysterious and fascinating. There's so much you can do with motions and body movements besides giving accurate beats.","So many things can drive you mad as a child, not only music.","Any gifted child can potentially get in real trouble because of the way they are handled.","I feel that you always pay when you are a child.","That's the goal, to survive your gift.","I listen to kids play a lot.","There are people who are uncanny, who are finished products at a young age. I wasn't, thank God.","I am playing the violin, that's all I know, nothing else, no education, no nothing. You just practice every day.","Competition can be the most nerve-racking experience. Some people just thrive on it.","In Paris they have special wheelchairs that go through every doorway. They don't change the doorways, they change the wheelchairs. To hell with the people! If someone weighs a couple more pounds, that's it!","When you play a concerto with a small orchestra, you don't feel it is as important as Carnegie Hall. You try to work out all the little problems. Once that's all done, trust comes in.","Trust your ability!","Sometimes you get from the mouth of kids wonderful things.","Child prodigy is a curse because you've got all those terrible possibilities.","That makes classical music work, the ability to improvise.","I look at raising funds for The Perlman Music Program as a challenge and as a way to provide opportunities for people who care about the future of classical music.","You get more nervous in front of a lot of people. That's why, when you play a concerto, you play with a small orchestra, in some place where you don't feel that it is as important as Carnegie Hall.","This young wine may have a lot of tannins now, but in five or 10 years it is going to be spectacular, despite the fact that right now it tastes like crude oil. You know this is how it is supposed to taste at this stage of development.","I love to work with young kids.","For people who are really talented, what you don't say becomes extremely important. You have to judge what to say and what to leave alone so you can let the talent develop.","Another thing that I don't like to do is show too much how it goes. I do it once in a blue moon. Sometimes there are lessons when I don't pick up a violin at all.","When you are 8 or 9, you should have a childhood. You should have adolescence. You should go through everything in a normal way.","My oldest daughter is a pianist; she plays concerts. We play together, also.","When you live in a small country such as Israel, the dream of any musician is to go abroad.","A lot of people ask me, 'What is your goal now that you have done everything?' And I always say that my goal is to not be bored by what I do. The only way that I cannot be bored by what I do is if I play something and it's all new to me.","I can tell you that many soloists probably wish they could sit.","I think that music has to do with what kind of passion do you have.","I have just one fiddle. It works, and that's it. It has been an old friend.","Only one of my grandchildren is serious about a musical instrument. The others dabble in it.","Television will always err on the side of making something not quite as classy as it could be.","To bring a large audience to a piece of serious music and make it accessible does not mean reducing it in any way. And I've learned that if something is good, even if it is a little difficult, people will get that it is good.","I've been lucky to conduct the very best orchestras in the world: New York, San Francisco, Chicago, Berlin, the London Philharmonic.","If you can read, then you can recite Shakespeare. But that's not acting.","The thing about talent is that it comes at different ages, sometimes at a very early age. That's when I find it to be the most challenging.","An amazing gift in a young child is, in some ways, an abnormality.","I met my wife in music camp. She's got great ears, and we have a relationship where she's not afraid to tell me anything. If something's going on in my playing, she will tell me about it, and that's very, very important.","I am an eternal optimist. I always say 'Yihyeh Tov' or 'It'll get better.'","When I was growing up in Israel, Cantorial music was something I heard over and over on the radio, so it wasn't at all strange to me. I was very familiar with the music.","'Kol Nidrei' is probably the most important prayer in the Jewish religion. It comes on the evening of Yom Kippur. There are so many different renditions of it.","Israel is the country of my birth. When I come here, I feel I'm coming home.","Teaching is really very, very important. I always tell my students that you should find an opportunity to teach. When you teach others, you teach yourself.","The danger in playing a piece over and over again lies in getting stuck in a rut where you don't ask questions anymore and you always play it the same way.","I am humbled and honored to receive the Genesis Prize, recognizing not just my professional achievements and my desire to improve the world, but also my commitment to my Jewish identity, Jewish values, and Jewish culture.","I have always been very proud of my Jewish heritage, which has greatly influenced my music, my world view, and my work as an advocate for individuals whom society often leaves behind.","My experience with the Detroit Symphony has been musically very satisfying. They have a wonderful sound, which for me is one of the most important qualities in an orchestra.","Access Living is a powerful voice for people in the Chicago area who live with disabilities.","The arts are part of the fiber of American society and should get Federal support.","The problems of the disabled are unpopular.","As for minimalism, I don't care, don't care, don't care to repeat myself, repeat myself.","I'm a mushroom freak. I make a mushroom soup where I use maybe six or seven varieties, not just portobello and shiitake, but dried porcini and morels.","I always find Bach to be an expression of a love of life. There's an enthusiasm that's absolutely contagious.","Brahms is one of my all-time favorite composers.","Whenever I play recitals, the part where I talk about music and my experiences of music, audiences always like it. They feel more involved with an artist who talks to them. It's a nice experience for me as well."],"Ivan Allen":["We didn't make the mistakes that many other cities did.","Atlanta? I think it's the greatest city anywhere I know of.","A lot of things happened in a lot of places. And to see how well it was handled in Atlanta. There are a lot of reasons for Atlanta being a special town in the Civil Rights era.","The only thing you think of is that you are in the middle and that you've got to find a way to stop it.","The city of Atlanta has always had a good spirit."],"Ivan Chermayeff":["Design is directed toward human beings. To design is to solve human problems by identifying them and executing the best solution."],"Ivan Glasenberg":["Many people may say that luck is important, but I think you create your own luck by working hard to ensure you don't miss opportunities.","Over two billion people in China and India need commodities to grow their economies and improve their living standards.","I stopped focusing on people being different, and I started treating everyone the same way.","You want to be a trader, come be a trader. The door's open. You want to travel six days a week, you want to travel the world, the door's open.","When we first invested in Colombia, we were buying a lot of coal from Colombia. We were dealing with them daily. I knew their guys at the port, I knew their guys at the mine, I had a feel of the country.","We're all shareholders. These guys below me, they see the CEO taking it easy, it's their money.","I've never opened a glass of champagne on any acquisition. Bankers do that.","You're doing a major merger, you got to hope you didn't get it wrong. That's the view of any CEO.","When the opportunities come, we may not want to buy another nickel asset, but if something comes cheap enough, we're all about return on equity.","I've said I will be CEO as long as my colleagues want me.","I thought if we could put our hard-working culture as traders into the asset management, it will be a great combination, and we did do that.","We work. You don't come here to take life easy. And we all got rich from it, so, you know, there's a benefit from it.","A lot of deals are done or not done because chief executives are not fully aligned to shareholders.","We want people who work for us to be entrepreneurs. We like them to look at ideas. We like them to chase ideas. We like them to not be what I call a caretaker of an asset.","Why should I build an asset when I can buy it more cheaply than you can build it?","What are we focused on? Return on equity. We don't need these great big tier one assets. I'm very happy with getting tier two, tier three assets; that's what Glencore has been good at.","It's easy to buy. Prove that you bought at the right time and the right price.","I'm a CEO of a public company. You have to show decorum.","We always look at opportunities. We are not aggressively looking to buy something.","You'll sacrifice a lot of things in the early part of your career to be successful, but to be ahead of your competitors, you have to work hard.","I observed a man sourcing candle wax from South America and selling it to Japan. I thought: 'That's unbelievable. Talking on the phone in his office, that man made money moving candle wax from one country to another.' It really interested me.","The trading side of the business means a lot of travel, being out of the office a lot of time.","We're talking to every third-party supplier every day of the week, and our traders are talking to them and buying products from them. When we're doing that, we see opportunities which no one else sees.","It's nice to do an IPO where your investors get value straightaway and the share price pops up; it proves you left something on the table for them.","We're creating new supply for the world, which is key. If we didn't get more tonnes into the system, your next motorcar is going to cost more because the aluminum cost is going to be higher.","Africa is where commodities are found, so it is vital that Glencore and other miners are there to develop those resources, helping Africa itself to grow at the same time."],"Ivan Illich":["We must rediscover the distinction between hope and expectation.","Modern medicine is a negation of health. It isn't organized to serve human health, but only itself, as an institution. It makes more people sick than it heals.","The public school has become the established church of secular society.","At the moment of death I hope to be surprised.","Leadership does not depend on being right.","Healthy people are those who live in healthy homes on a healthy diet; in an environment equally fit for birth, growth work, healing, and dying... Healthy people need no bureaucratic interference to mate, give birth, share the human condition and die.","School divides life into two segments, which are increasingly of comparable length. As much as anything else, schooling implies custodial care for persons who are declared undesirable elsewhere by the simple fact that a school has been built to serve them.","Effective health care depends on self-care; this fact is currently heralded as if it were a discovery.","The compulsion to do good is an innate American trait. Only North Americans seem to believe that they always should, may, and actually can choose somebody with whom to share their blessings. Ultimately this attitude leads to bombing people into the acceptance of gifts.","There is no greater distance than that between a man in prayer and God."],"Ivan Krastev":["What makes me worry today is the alarming decline in the trust in democratic institutions - political parties, Parliaments, political leaders. Less and less people are going to the polls in most advanced democracies.","Transparency is not about restoring trust in institutions. Transparency is the politics of managing mistrust.","Authoritarianism is not pretending anymore to be a real alternative to democracy, but we can see many more authoritarian practices and styles basically being smuggled into democratic governments.","Democracy has always been in crisis: democracy is all about practicing the art of bearable dissatisfaction. In democratic societies, people often complain about their leaders and their institutions. The gap between the ideal democracy and the existing one cannot be bridged.","Russians clearly perceive America's global influence as being in irreversible decline and American society shattered by major political, economic and ideological crises.","Regimes like the one in Russia are stabilized by the fact that they have no ideology. There is really no ideological means to attack them.","A more stable relationship between Poland and Russia based on reconciliation might revive the reunification of Europe.","Germany, because of the fact and the perception of a special relationship with Russia, is the only one who can influence Russian debate. Russians also believe that Germans understand them best because they've been through a big war and know what humiliation means.","For the European Union, Russia is as important politically and economically as China is to the U.S.","Bulgaria has been deindustrialized by interest groups who extracted state assets like oil states extract the oil in their ground.","The crisis of democracy in the West is not the result of falling in love with another system. In Europe and America people who are disillusioned with democracy do not dream about the Chinese model or any other form of authoritarian rule. They do not dream about government that controls Internet and puts in prison those daring to disagree.","Any unveiling is also veiling. No matter how transparent our governments want to be, governments will be selectively transparent.","In 2008, Putin's message was, 'We aren't like a Central Asian republic, we aren't going to build a personalistic regime, we will have institutions.' This is all abolished now. The very idea of a governing party and party career, as you have in China, that didn't work.","For the Kremlin, it is more feasible to preserve its great-power status in cooperation with the United States than in confrontation.","The United States and Russia probably do not have common aims and dreams, but they have common worries: Both Washington and Moscow are concerned about the rise of China and are threatened by the rise of radical Islam.","The post-Cold War order in Europe is finished, with Vladimir Putin its executioner. Russia's invasion of Georgia only marked its passing. Russia has emerged as a born-again 19th-century power determined to challenge the intellectual, moral and institutional foundations of the order.","The E.U. cannot act as guardian of the post-Cold War status quo without risking a collapse of Europe's current institutional infrastructure.","True, Putin's Russia does not dream of joining the E.U., but Russia's stability depends on preserving the European nature of its regime.","Living in truth cannot be reduced to having access to full information.","It is people's willingness to take personal risks and confront the powerful by daring to speak the truth, not the truth itself, that ultimately leads to change.","As a rule, governments monitor people.","America is militarily overstretched, politically polarized and financially indebted.","America is a nation of immigrants, but it is also a nation of people who never emigrate. Notably, Americans living outside the United States are not called emigrants, but 'expats.'","America gave the world the notion of the melting pot - an alchemical cooking device wherein diverse ethnic and religious groups voluntarily mix together, producing a new, American identity. And while critics may argue that the melting pot is a national myth, it has tenaciously informed the America's collective imagination.","As China is about adaptation, not transformation, it is unlikely to change the world dramatically should it ever assume the global driver's seat. But this does not mean that China won't exploit that world for its own purposes.","Before, revolutions used to have ideological names. They could be communist, they could be liberal, they could be fascist or Islamic. Now, the revolutions are called under the medium which is most used. You have Facebook revolutions, Twitter revolutions. The content doesn't matter anymore - the problem is the media.","Remember, until the 1970s, the spread of democracy has always been accompanied by the decline of inequality. The more democratic our societies have been, the more equal they have been becoming. Now we have the reverse tendency. The spread of democracy now is very much accompanied by the increase in inequality."],"Ivan Lendl":["I enjoy life. I always enjoy jokes.","If you look at any superior athlete, you will find a strong parental influence. Parents introduce their children to a sport, and then they support them.","Once you win, you have no doubt that you can win. So you have gone through it once, and you can do it again.","I think talent is dangerous to have if you take it for granted. If you use it well and put hard work with it together, it's hard to catch that guy. And I think that's what you're seeing right now.","People may say I developed an iron will, but what really happened is that I made myself much fitter. I think an iron will is always supported by fitness.","In tennis you move a lot. Golf you don't. In tennis, you can have a bad half-hour, but you can't in golf. You can lose the first set in tennis and still win.","You know, you just go out there, do your best. Sometimes it's good enough and sometimes it is, and sometimes it stays your only one and sometimes you win bunch others behind it.","Many Czech people are very talented. They can do many things, but when they get to a certain level, they are satisfied. I am not like that, thank God.","If I don't practice the way I should, then I won't play the way that I know I can.","I got bad calls every match, and I never got an apology. So I thought it was rather strange.","I think if you look at Andre then and now, you look at two different models. Of course it's personal preference, I think Andre now is a great role model for the kids. He has started training differently than he was before, and so on and so on.","I just travel all the time. And I was just looking at the schedules now and starting the first week of October I will be every weekend with somebody at tournaments through Christmas. So it gets very difficult to just go away and not do that.","But to be fair, if you take players from my era to now, the game has changed and the players have many more shots. They use them differently than we did. The speed of the game has changed.","I was between 2 and 3 in the world for two, three years. That's not exactly where I wanted to be.","Because in order to beat Jimmy, I had to get around the ball a little bit quicker so I wasn't always on defensive and catching the ball on last stride, that I had little more time. Once I was able to get little bit quicker, then it has helped me a lot.","But it's very difficult, I can tell you I played the Czech Open a few times and it's very difficult just to go on to a scene where the course is prepared differently when the greens are fast and he's not used to it and they're hard as a rock and he's not used to it.","Many times the players get in there and it's just about as well as they could have done, and other times they get in there and they favorites and they don't win.","I don't make a habit of watching tennis matches, but I try to watch all the major finals. I try to make time for that. So unless I have something going with the kids where I can't, I try to watch, and I enjoy that.","If you go to school and practice for five days a week, it still gives you two days you can go and see your friends, you can go to the movies, you do whatever you like to do.","I'm certainly not sorry that there were some things I missed. You may think you're missing something at that time but later when you look at it, you didn't miss anything.","It's flattering to be compared in any way to Tiger Woods, because he's the best player in the world.","Tennis is not like other sports where the coach is hired by an independent entity, and that makes a huge difference in the dynamic.","Many tennis coaches are enablers. They need the job more than the player needs the coach, and if the coach needs the job more than the player needs the coach, he can't effect change.","Tennis is basically a game where you try to create an opportunity for yourself to finish the point, because you can't wait for the opponent to miss anymore. Well, if you create an opportunity and don't take advantage of it, you let the opponent back to even, then you are just starting the point over, so you have to take advantage of them.","If you lose, it hurts, but as long as you have fought hard, you can still feel good about yourself.","Not winning at Wimbledon is not going to bother me forever.","My serve and my forehand I pretty much always had, but my backhand was a made backhand. I worked on it for years.","You know how kids are. They like to do what parents do.","Too many people asking too many questions in tennis. Golf is better.","I like to compete.","If you become great, then you can become happy. If you're happy first, it's much more difficult to be great.","You can never guarantee the wins but you can guarantee that you give it 100%. That way you can always look back and feel comfortable, as a player or a coach.","You have to focus on the process. You cannot be glued to the results.","It's very nice to see when somebody who wanted to work hard and is willing to put the work in gets rewarded for it.","Olympic gold is obviously right up there with a grand slam. It's a big win. You can say it's more, you can say it's less, you can say it's equal. It's very much up there.","I certainly don't lose any sleep if I lose a tennis match."],"Ivan Pavlov":["It is not accidental that all phenomena of human life are dominated by the search for daily bread - the oldest link connecting all living things, man included, with the surrounding nature.","But man has still another powerful resource: natural science with its strictly objective methods.","Perfect as the wing of a bird may be, it will never enable the bird to fly if unsupported by the air. Facts are the air of science. Without them a man of science can never rise.","Finally, as the digestive canal is a complex system, a series of separate chemical laboratories, I cut the connections between them in order to investigate the course of phenomena in each particular laboratory; thus I resolved the digestive canal into several separate parts.","The physiologist who succeeds in penetrating deeper and deeper into the digestive canal becomes convinced that it consists of a number of chemical laboratories equipped with various mechanical devices.","While you are experimenting, do not remain content with the surface of things.","Appetite, craving for food, is a constant and powerful stimulator of the gastric glands.","Our success was mainly due to the fact that we stimulated the nerves of animals that easily stood on their own feet and were not subjected to any painful stimulus either during or immediately before stimulation of their nerves.","It goes without saying that the desire to accomplish the task with more confidence, to avoid wasting time and labour, and to spare our experimental animals as much as possible, made us strictly observe all the precautions taken by surgeons in respect to their patients.","It is clear to all that the animal organism is a highly complex system consisting of an almost infinite series of parts connected both with one another and, as a total complex, with the surrounding world, with which it is in a state of equilibrium.","Thanks to our present surgical methods in physiology we can demonstrate at any time almost all phenomena of digestion without the loss of even a single drop of blood, without a single scream from the animal undergoing the experiment.","Our experiments not only proved the existence of a nervous apparatus in the above-mentioned glands, but also disclosed some facts clearly showing the participation of these nerves in normal activity.","The digestive canal represents a tube passing through the entire organism and communicating with the external world, i.e. as it were the external surface of the body, but turned inwards and thus hidden in the organism.","Don't become a mere recorder of facts, but try to penetrate the mystery of their origin.","Only by observing this condition would the results of our work be regarded as fully conclusive and as having elucidated the normal course of the phenomena.","From the described experiment it is clear that the mere act of eating, the food even not reaching the stomach, determines the stimulation of the gastric glands.","It has long been known for sure that the sight of tasty food makes a hungry man's mouth water; also lack of appetite has always been regarded as an undesirable phenomenon, from which one might conclude that appetite is essentially linked with the process of digestion.","In the case of the stomach, however, the nerves of the glandular cells were always severed when constructing an artificially isolated pouch and this, naturally, affected the normal work of the stomach.","As was to be expected, the discovery of the nervous apparatus of the salivary glands immediately impelled physiologists to seek a similar apparatus in other glands lying deeper in the digestive canal.","The gastric laboratory uses its protein ferment under an acid reaction.","Edible substances evoke the secretion of thick, concentrated saliva. Why? The answer, obviously, is that this enables the mass of food to pass smoothly through the tube leading from the mouth into the stomach.","Physiology has, at last, gained control over the nerves which stimulate the gastric glands and the pancreas."],"Ivan Reitman":["A good actor is someone who knows how to take the part and make it real and make it honest and be effective in it. If it's in a funny movie and, as long as they are cast in an appropriate way, humor will come from it.","I always see things that I can improve. But frankly with Stripes, I'm surprised at how effective it is, even today, and how vibrant that movie is and how juicy the performances all are.","Everybody says how hard comedy is, but, when it comes time to honor things, whether it's on a weekly critical basis or whether it's award time, at that time of the year, comedy is the poor, dumb child of dramatic work.","Also watching a movie on DVD is different than watching it in the theater.","I always thought that Bill Murray was one of the great actors that I've worked with. And I've worked with all kinds of people who are known primarily for their dramatic work.","I call it like the domino theory of reality. If you can go one step at a time and it seems to make sense, you can then take your audience into an area that is relatively outlandish.","I don't think my sense of humor has changed at all; I was born with this, for better or for worse.","I don't think there will be another Ghostbusters. I think we're all too old to do it. I think we've done it a couple times and there is not that much to get out of it, to do that would be fresh in it.","I love horror and sci-fi.","I never like to do parodies. I never do. It's just not my style of comedy.","I remember when first, Stripes, and then Animal House came out - which I was really proud of, even though it was kind of loose and quite raucous - there were imitative movies that were not quite as good.","I think Junior is certainly a science fiction premise as is Twins, as is Dave, beyond Ghostbusters.","I'd always been a science fiction enthusiast.","I'm not sure I agree with the thesis, because I think that even though something grotesque or gross has been part of film since way back, what we accept or what we can get away with on the screen is broader now.","I've always been a fan of science fiction films, and I've never been able to put my particular spin on it.","I've always believed in populating my films with characters who we like, who we have some warmth for, who have warmth for each other, who we would like to hang out with, who we emulate in one way or another.","In a comedy it helps enhance things that were already there.","In many ways, I think that, while we've been remarkably violent in our media, there's been a real schizophrenia. In private, on the Internet, and on public-affairs shows or talk radio, we're way more explicit than we've ever been.","It's been about 15 years, and I've never really worked seriously in CGI and I thought that here was an opportunity to do the kinds of things that I was not able to do on Ghostbusters.","It's sort of the most important thing for acting, is to listen to the person you're dealing with.","Movies either work or they don't work and they're either funny or they're not and we work very hard. To achieve that kind of work is really kind of delicate stitching.","My first student film was Orientation, which was basically the set-up for Animal House. There are a couple of scenes that we later borrowed in some form.","My sense is, I think it's okay for directors to do movies that speak to other work in their career.","The home viewing experience is slightly different and there's room for these kinds of extra excursions.","Then my first film was something called Cannibal Girls, which sounds like a horror movie but was actually kind of a goofy comedy with horror elements. Like a horror spoof.","We got some devastating reviews on Animal House at the start.","Well, actually, I did start out in comedies. Very, very early.","When you have a performer as talented as Bill Murray or as Harold, that can write as well as they can perform, you can do a final draft on the set if you think of it that way."],"Ivan Turgenev":["To desire and expect nothing for oneself and to have profound sympathy for others is genuine holiness.","People without firmness of character love to make up a fate for themselves; that relieves them of the necessity of having their own will and of taking responsibility for themselves.","We sit in the mud... and reach for the stars.","Women... can't live with 'em... can't shoot 'em.","Time sometimes flies like a bird, sometimes crawls like a snail; but a man is happiest when he does not even notice whether it passes swiftly or slowly.","A poet must be a psychologist, but a secret one: he should know and feel the roots of phenomena but present only the phenomena themselves in full bloom or as they fade away.","In the end, nature is inexorable: it has no reason to hurry and, sooner or later, it takes what belongs to it. Unconsciously and inflexibly obedient to its own laws, it doesn't know art, just as it doesn't know freedom, just as it doesn't know goodness.","Nature creates while destroying, and doesn't care whether it creates or destroys as long as life isn't extinguished, as long as death doesn't lose its rights.","The word tomorrow was invented for indecisive people and for children.","In days of doubt, in days of dreary musings on my country's fate, you alone are my comfort and support, oh great, powerful, righteous, and free Russian language!","However much you knock at nature's door, she will never answer you in comprehensible words.","There are some moments in life, some feelings; one can only point to them and pass by.","Who among us has the strength to oppose petty egoism, those petty good feelings, pity and remorse?","Circumstances define us; they force us onto one road or another, and then they punish us for it.","Most people can't understand how others can blow their noses differently than they do.","I agree with no one's opinion. I have some of my own.","Death's an old joke, but each individual encounters it anew.","One may speak about anything on earth with fire, with enthusiasm, with ecstasy, but one only speaks about oneself with avidity.","Whatever a person may pray for, that person prays for a miracle. Every prayer comes down to this - Almighty God, grant that two times two not equal four."],"Ivana Milicevic":["'The Princess Bride' is one of my favorite movies of all time.","I'm not sure that the problem of violence in society can be put at the feet of the entertainment industry.","I'm blonde and bad.","Whatever past you had, when you become a mother, it's a whole different thing. You can't even predict it. I've seen women who were nightmare party girls, who were just crazy, and then they have a baby, and this thing comes over them and changes them."],"Ivana Trump":["Gorgeous hair is the best revenge.","One should never live with regrets or with 'what if.' I've loved the good times, and I have learned from the bad. All in all, it's been a pretty fabulous life for me.","As you get older, your tastes get simpler. I like a sleek evening dress with a pair of big earrings. That's all.","Looking good is the best revenge.","I always felt very secure and very safe with real estate. Real estate always appreciates.","In business, you have to be strong. If you are weak, people are going to take advantage.","For many years I enjoyed the pleasure of cruising on my yacht all summer long and these were my best holidays. In mid-May, we'd start in St Tropez. I'd collect my bikinis from my home there and then we'd go up to Cannes for the Film Festival, on to Monte Carlo for the Grand Prix and then to Italy.","I made a tremendous amount of money on real estate. I'll take real estate rather than go to Wall Street and get 2.8 percent. Forget about it.","There are three things in life I really don't like: Rice pudding. Social climbers - you know, hang-ons! And the photo shoot!","I have good legs, and why to hide them?","I want great food and wine, and friends to enjoy it all.","Sadly, Princess Diana and I were just about the first divorced women to come under the global press's microscope. But I have a feeling it's a full and active club now.","I'm a single parent, a working mother, an executive, and an author. My greatest accomplishment will be to raise three wonderful children.","Don't get mad. Get everything!","I'm a lady, and I run my business with dignity. I don't need to be tough. You get nowhere screaming.","From the age of 6, when I won my first race in skiing, I was on the national ski teams, really until Olympics in '72, so I always had a lot of discipline and commitment to achieve as much as I could in good way. Competitiveness doesn't stop when you stop skiing.","Generally, I think America is America. America has been through suffering like other countries, but America will come up. I have no doubt. It's just going to bounce. You know, you have ups and downs.","Fiction writing is great. You can make up almost anything.","I make money because I have to pay for everything apart from my school fees. My mother even makes me pay my own telephone bill.","I feel young at heart, and I feel, like, you know, 40.","I tell you, if I'm going to go through a divorce, I would date again a younger man. Because I have so much energy, there's no way an older man can keep up with me.","I wear black all the time.","There's nothing my housekeeper does that I can't do - and maybe better!","You have to have the common sense.","For example, if I make money, I put it in real estate. I always did very well. Location, location, location.","In Positano, I like the San Pietro Hotel, which is run by a friend whose family has owned the hotel for more than 100 years.","Travelling so much, sometimes my luggage goes astray. But I can get the right stuff sent to me overnight by a special shipper. No big deal.","New York City is a very tough place. I'm tough, too. When people give me a punch in the nose, I react by getting even tougher.","I can ski backwards on one ski. And foldblinded!","I'm young at heart and dress accordingly.","Life is life, so try to enjoy it. You only have one life.","I believe that two people can meet and enrich each other's lives. I'd say that about my parents. But I think it is harder and harder to commit to only one person in a lifetime.","In each of my homes, I have a leopard room. I don't know why, but I do. It's like my lounge next to the dressing rooms.","When I was doing poorly at school, my father yanked me out and got me a job in a shoe factory. After three weeks, I begged him to give me another chance at doing well in school. I learned that discipline is necessary to accomplish anything in life.","I have a very active social life. It may look glamorous, and it is, but it also takes an enormous amount of time.","What I know is that my upbringing was always the man was the head of the family. It's a European tradition. We always look up to the man. But this is old times. Now what I believe is that I'm definitely equal."],"Ivanka Trump":["My father taught my siblings and me the importance of positive values and a strong ethical compass. He showed us how to be resilient, how to deal with challenges, and how to strive for excellence in all that we do. He taught us that there's nothing that we cannot accomplish if we marry vision and passion with an enduring work ethic.","In both business and personal life, I've always found that travel inspires me more than anything else I do. Evidence of the languages, cultures, scenery, food, and design sensibilities that I discover all over the world can be found in every piece of my jewelry.","Running is a great metaphor for life. You set a goal, and then you get to work. How well you do is a direct reflection of how hard you work. It's a mental game, too. There are setbacks along the way, but the true test of a runner is how you overcome and push past them.","Divorce is never a nice thing, but it's very easy to take family for granted, and when there's a divorce, you don't take things for granted so much.","The more natural or eco-based products you can introduce into your beauty regimen, the more beneficial it is for your skin. It's similar to introducing organic food into your daily diet.","Go for a walk through Central Park and stop at the Met. It's the best way to get a feel for what makes New York so special.","A timeless piece of jewelry, like pearls or stud earrings, has lasting value. I bought a vintage ring for $600 with my first paycheck; I plan to pass it down to my daughter.","I wanted to be a businesswoman from as early as I can remember, and specifically, my real passion was real estate.","Love what you do. There's always going to be someone else who's smarter than you, but there's no substitute for passion. People who are passionate always work the hardest, and that sets them apart.","I don't think you are truly successful unless you are a happy person and are happy with your life. I know many people who are professionally successful but miserable.","A word of advice: your interview is about you. It's not about the school you went to, what you majored in, what your GPA was, or who your parents happen to be or know. Most of that stuff is right on your resume, and it might even have gotten you into the room, but it won't get you much farther.","Life is a marathon, not a sprint. It's about taking a bigger-picture approach.","Real estate is my life. It is my day job, if you will. But it consumes my nights and weekends, too.","The way in which you carry yourself, even when seated at a desk, matters.","It's interesting, but because I have my own collection, I actually almost never purchase jewelry unless it's sort of playful, whimsical pieces that are more fashion, a little less investment-oriented. Most of my personal jewelry collection is from my own collection. The pieces that get layered in tend to be gifts from my husband.","I think it is bad luck to put shoes on a table or walk under ladders.","I'm a big believer in creating family traditions. Every Tuesday morning, I make a proper eggs breakfast, and we all sit down and eat.","You really don't need to study how to change a diaper. As a new mom, you learn pretty darn quickly!","When I was little, I'd pick flowers wherever I traveled with my mom, then dry them, cover them with resin, and turn them into paperweights.","I typically wake up at 5:30, and that's my time. I read newspapers, have coffee.","I've started ordering out of teen catalogues! T-shirts, little coats, and jackets for around $35 - they're amazing. I've become a really big fan of Urban Outfitters, Alloy and Anthropologie. Because I'll pay for quality, but I will not just pay for trend. Psychologically, I have trouble with that.","Whether it's color palettes for my apparel collection or materials for handbags and shoes or inspiration for fine jewelry, traveling expands your mind and opens you up to different things you haven't seen before.","I have always admired women that have a strong sense of self, complemented by femininity. I especially appreciate the presence of these women in traditionally male-dominated industries, such as real estate.","Instagram is my favorite! It's interactive and a fun way to stay connected to my friends, family and fans. I love posting photos from family trips, property visits, previews of my collections, everything!","I obviously have a great love and appreciation of jewelry, thanks to my mother, much to the dismay of both my father and my boyfriends.","Pessimists are toxic. I love optimists - and by that, I don't mean people who are unable to see challenges. Optimists are solution-oriented.","I'll take the stairs instead of the elevator, or when I'm on a phone call, I'll do squats or pace the room when I'm talking. We're modern women! We have to figure out how to make it work, right?","I love making vegetable, pea, and broccoli soups. They're pure, low-calorie, and incredibly tasty.","I enjoy wearing fragrance every day and have found myself searching for the one signature scent that truly reflects my personality and the things I love, such as Bulgarian rose. I have always wanted to create a fragrance from its inception to fruition and articulate femininity, confidence, and fortitude.","I started with jewelry when I was probably 24 years old. It was really just in response to a feeling that most of the fine jewelers were men appealing to men and selling pieces in a very unmodern way. I felt that there was a huge demographic of self-purchasing women who were feeling uncomfortable in the traditional retail environment.","No matter how different a career path we choose from our parents, people will always say we wouldn't have gotten there if it hadn't been for our name. And in the end, there's no way to tell if that's true or not. Maybe it's not the worst thing for people not to see you coming. If people want to underestimate me, I'm fine with that.","I always envisioned myself having a traditional and elegant wedding.","I really find that with Judaism, it creates an amazing blueprint for family connectivity.","Everything about mediocrity kills me.","I consider myself incredibly fortunate to be a woman working in America. It looks very different to be a working woman in other places in the world.","For me, one of my life's mission is to disrupt these dated concepts of what it really looks like and means to be a working woman. The expression 'working man' is never heard in conjunction. But people still talk about this sort of 'working woman,' and there's a bit of negativity to that connotation.","When I bid out our construction projects, I call contractors personally to close the deal and get the best price or enhance the scope of their deliverable. You don't get what you don't ask for.","I don't have a sweet tooth, normally; I'm a salty-savory girl. But when I'm pregnant, almost as a ritual, at 4 o'clock, I'll have cookies-and-cream ice cream!","The average person can look at someone in public life and say they have it all, but they might be struggling. Or you may think another person has more apparent challenges, but she's deeply grateful for her life. I don't think anyone can judge what having it all means for someone else.","I've fallen in love with Waikiki; the beach, the climate, the people, and the hotel - it really is a paradise.","Quality for me is key, and this stands true in every facet of my business from real estate, hotels, and fashion.","If you ask me, there's nothing more incredible than a woman who's in charge of her own destiny - and working daily to make her dreams a reality.","I'm a daughter, not a clone. So, of course, daughters often disagree with things their fathers say. But I share my viewpoints with him privately, not publicly. I'm not the candidate.","I think parental leave is enormously important - and it's a personal decision. Part of building a company whose goal is to empower women in all aspects of life is that I've given my team some leeway to determine what parental leave looks like for each of them individually.","A Miami must-have is the trendy Panther Coffee in Wynwood. I like Alma Mexicana for the ever-popular breakfast burrito. For out-of-this-world Cuban food, the Cubano at Little Bread Cuban Sandwich Co. will satisfy your craving. My friends all love Shorty's Bar-B-Q for the mouth-watering corn on the cob and BBQ, of course.","You can be born into privilege, or you can not be born into privilege. You can be born into the opposite extreme and into poverty. I think from there on, though, you really do have to make your luck.","My mornings are really about being with my children, so I tend to lay out my outfit the night before when my children are asleep so I can have a quick turnaround time in the morning.","I spearhead interior design for all Trump projects.","I always prefer to speak face-to-face, typically in my own office, where I'm most comfortable.","Thanks to my Czech-German heritage, I can't get enough of savory foods like stews, sausage, noodles, and anything that involves melted cheese. Not great choices from a dietary perspective, but at the end of a long day, I feel like I'm entitled.","As president, my father will change the labor laws put in place when women were not a significant portion of the workforce. He will make childcare affordable and accessible to all. He will fight for equal pay for equal work, and I will fight for this, too, right alongside of him.","People ask me, do I ever disagree with my father? It would be a little strange if I didn't.","People talk about balance. Balance is an awful measure of things because it implies a scale that inevitably tips. I like to look through the filter of, 'Is the life I'm leading consistent with my priorities?' For me, my family is the ultimate litmus test.","Your post-college years should be an exploratory time in your professional life. From your early twenties and on into your early thirties, you should feel free to explore your professional prospects. Keep an open mind, and don't expect to get everything right straight out of the gate. Be prepared to start over once or twice.","In business, I believe that if you focus only on the journey, you'll miss the whole point of the enterprise. There has to be a goal, an end game of some kind; otherwise, you're just spinning your wheels. Yes, the journey is important, but the destination is important, too.","When I was younger, I was more self-conscious about living up to or surpassing the expectations of others. But as you get older, you start to build confidence.","The harder you work, the luckier you get. I'm a big believer in that.","I think it's the human condition to be frequently embarrassed by your parents.","My father not only has the strength and ability necessary to be our next president, but also the kindness and compassion that will enable him to be the leader that this country needs.","Like many of my fellow millennials, I do not consider myself categorically Republican or Democrat. More than party affiliation, I vote on based on what I believe is right, for my family and for my country. Sometimes it's a tough choice.","Half of the time, I'm walking around a construction site, then I'm transitioning into the evening, having drinks with the girlfriends or meeting with my husband and then racing back home to put the kids to bed. I have less time, so I'm a much more efficient decision maker.","Just go out and do things, and those things that continue to spark an interest, do more of.","Having toddlers always means that there's a fair amount of chaos at home, but that's part of the fun.","From a productivity perspective, prioritization is key. And it's very easy to focus on clearing the decks of minutia, especially when one's very busy.","Are you asking for a raise? Do your research and know your market value. Having an informed sense of your worth, as dictated by the broader marketplace, will give you greater confidence in requesting increased compensation. It's tough to dispute someone who can back up her assertions with facts and a smart, articulate argument.","I try to put out what I'm going to wear the night before. It just makes things a little bit more seamless in the mornings. There is definitely, you know, sort of a trusty work uniform - a chic, feminine dress that's easy and versatile.","We launched our #WomenWhoWork initiative to show the world what today's modern, professional women really look like. They're invested in their careers, but they're also passionate about priorities outside the office.","I spend a lot of time building teams at both businesses - both The Trump Organization and my own - and thinking about who to hire to supplement the team and allow us to best achieve our goals.","Nobody says 'a working man,' but they say, 'a working woman.' And there is still a strange connotation to that.","I hope my children just grow up happy and pursue their dreams. I mean, that's all I can ask of them.","In Donald Trump, you have a candidate who knows the difference between wanting something done and making it happen.","Practice negotiating, and hone your style and skills with low-consequence transactions. Call the phone company and threaten to switch providers if they won't give you a better deal on your service going forward. Go to a boutique and ask for a discount.","I generally wake up, exercise and read through a huge amount of newspapers. I get to the office somewhere between 7:30 and 8:00 - my brothers and I are always the first ones in.","The country's top chefs, designers, media personalities and businesses are part of this dynamic city. We know that Chicagoans are used to the highest standards.","If people think I'm just the boss's daughter, they're deceived.","If people think they can elicit from me whatever terms they want, they are mistaken.","There are enough stories about my family. We have all been in the public eye.","I think my mom threatened to put me up for adoption a few times.","Modeling was not an endgame for me. I didn't particularly enjoy the act of it.","I'm not a clone, and I'm not a minion.","I hate having people sit in on meetings.","I like very strong guys. Successful guys. Not necessarily financially.","Honestly, I have a tendency to date dorks. Which means that a lot of times, I date guys that no one else would deem to be a hunk.","I'm not saying that if you're working at home, raising a family, that's not work. I want to disrupt the narrative around what it means to be a woman who works. The whole point of my brand is that women should be architecting the lives they want to live.","I had very busy parents, but I really appreciated having a set of traditions during my own childhood, like consistently celebrating holidays at the same place.","I used to love sitting on the bathroom floor in my pajamas and watching my mother get ready for an event. She'd stand in front of her vanity and apply bright red and blue makeup - it was the '80s, you know.","I don't do press for the sake of press. I tend to only be in the press when I'm introducing something or collaborating on something or whatever it may be, as opposed to inviting someone into my home to photograph my closet for no particular reason.","I am almost always, when I'm at home in the evening after work, in a silk bathrobe I got from India. Like, I never take off this bathrobe. I have a series of Indian silk bathrobes that I love, and that's what I rock all the time.","My mom grew up in the Soviet Bloc, and she was a Tiger Mom. We didn't get away with much.","I don't plan to take a formal, cold approach with my children, but I expect a lot. I don't want my children to view me as their best friend. I want to be their mom.","Even the most high-maintenance boss isn't going to sit and watch you the whole time, making sure you're paying attention to them, whereas with a child, it's like, 'Wait, what? You're not watching me right now? Really? Then I'm going to go spill this milk.' Even bosses from hell don't behave like that!","My father is definitely not the kind of guy who'd place his children in key roles within his organization if he didn't think we could surpass the expectations he had for us.","I have a tough skin and enough confidence not to worry too much about being underestimated because of my last name, my relative youth, or my modeling background. It comes with the territory.","Whatever we do, whatever our backgrounds, we've all had some kind of advantage somewhere along the way. Some break that might have gone to someone else. Some edge or inside track we couldn't have counted on.","People sometimes approach me tentatively or suspiciously because of my father's reputation as a world-class negotiator, as if they think I'm about to take advantage of them. As if I know something I'm not letting on.","The reality is I have a closet full of shoes that I don't wear because they are not comfortable, and I am not going to be hobbling between meetings. There's nothing that ruins an entrance like somebody who's uncomfortable in their shoes.","I think my dad is highly gender-neutral. If he doesn't like someone, he'll articulate that, and I think it's also part of what resonates about him. He'll say what he's thinking.","I love my father very much. I attribute so much of the person I am today to the values that he and my mother set for us, and the way they encouraged us every day of our lives to go out and find what we love doing and to fulfill our potential and really be happy.","When you are in the public eye, it is really counterproductive to think about how you're viewed in the eyes of others. You just have to be who you are.","I don't have a problem if somebody who has never met me wants to say that I wouldn't be where I was today without my family because you know what? They may be right.","Know what you want to achieve prior to starting to negotiate. It's the golden rule but the one most people fail to heed. Without a plan, you allow the opposing party to define your goals instead of the other way around.","Oftentimes, the best negotiations result in a deal that benefits both parties. There are times when you simply want to go for the jugular, but often, you want the other person to feel pleased with the outcome, even if you are the clear victor.","Real change, the kind we have not seen in decades, is only going to come from outside the system. And it's only going to come from a man who's spent his entire life doing what others said could not be done. My father is a fighter.","My father values talent. He recognizes real knowledge and skill when he finds it. He is color blind and gender neutral. He hires the best person for the job, period.","Politicians talk about wage equality, but my father has made it a practice at his company throughout his entire career. He will fight for equal pay for equal work, and I will fight for this, too, right along side of him.","A Trump presidency will turn the economy around and restore the great American tradition of giving each new generation hope for brighter opportunities than those of the generation that came before.","As president, my father will take on the bold and worthy fights. He will be unafraid to set lofty goals, and he will be relentless in his determination to achieve them.","To people all over America, I say, when you have my father in your corner, you will never again have to worry about being let down. He will fight for you all the time, all the way, every time.","The hardworking men and women of this country identify with my father. He is tough, and he is persevering. He is honest, and he is real. He's an optimist, and he's a relentless believer in America and all of her potential. He loves his family, and he loves his country with his heart and his soul.","There have always been men of all background and ethnicities on my father's job sites. And long before it was commonplace, you also saw women.","My husband's idea of a date night somehow always involves me looking at one of his development sites.","Me and my peers, we're working really hard at being moms and sisters and professionals.","There was a previous generation of women who rose through the ranks in an environment when work and life were highly compartmentalized. And I think now, because of technology, we're always on. Where there used to be work life and home life, now it's one life. And I think a lot of companies don't recognize that.","I'm not going to advocate for a female leader who I'm voting for solely on the basis of gender. And I think a lot of people feel that way.","My brothers and I early on said to one another that, as a collective, we could do far more than any of us could do individually.","The way my father raised me was really informative of how I think about my role as a female and how I view myself in a professional and personal capacity. So he encouraged me to set the bar very high for myself, to set great goals for myself.","My father is the opposite of politically correct. He says what he means, and he means what he says.","I made a specific choice not to call my collection Ivanka. There's so much value in the Trump name. And there's such a deep connection to luxury and success.","When Donald Trump is in charge, all that counts is ability, effort, and excellence. This has long been the philosophy at the Trump Organization. At my father's company, there are more female than male executives. Women are paid equally for the work that we do, and when a woman becomes a mother, she is supported, not shut out.","The presidency of the United States is an incredible thing. You have an ability to effectuate change at the highest level.","I can't imagine that I would be the person I am today if, over the last seven years, I had been married to somebody who didn't feel 100 percent comfortable with my drive, my ambition, my interest in thinking big and swinging for the fences.","My father values talent. He is colorblind and gender neutral. When Donald Trump is in charge, all that counts is ability, excellence, and effort.","There's nothing I have more of in my closet than little white dresses. They're versatile and elegant, but sexy in a feminine way. And then I'll have a bit more fun with accessories - like a pair of neon sandals.","Cardigans. I stock up on them - I own tons. They go great over dresses and help them transition from season to season.","I'm always running up and down buildings or around 800-acre properties for work - you can't do that in heels or flip-flops!","No matter what I hear about my parents, about my family, no matter what I read, the fact is that I'm absolutely proud to be a Trump. For a while, I was worried that for my whole life I'd sort of be under my parents' shadow, but it's not a bad shadow to be under.","I remember, growing up, my mother had a work wardrobe. It was this very compartmentalized area of her closet. It was suits, but she would never wear those suits out on a date with my father!","I'll do manicures, but I won't wear nail polish because I don't have time to change it, and I chip my nail polish so quickly. I cannot last three days! I think it's the typing and the use - or overuse - of tech. I'm the chip queen!","I don't own a blow-dryer - I don't know how to use it. Most mornings, I walk to work with my hair wet.","I'm a closet 'Real Housewives' fan. Any season, any year.","Marrying Jared was the best decision I've ever made. You realize in life, not that many things matter that much, but your choice of a spouse is everything. We're truly partners - he supports my work and my ambitions. I know that he's always got my back, and I've got his.","My mother taught me to appreciate a good drugstore beauty aisle. I regularly use Aquaphor, Chap Stick, Purpose Face Soap, and Aveeno body moisturizer.","My real name is actually Ivana.","I used to spend summers in the Czech Republic with my grandmother. I'd watch Czech cartoons.","I auditioned for the part of Cosette in 'Les Miserables' on Broadway. It didn't work out.","While I tend to favor styles that are glamorous, old Hollywood by night and very sleek and tailored during the day, I'm mindful of the fact that I'm 27 years old and try not to make that feel dowdy or old.","Passion is something that's hard to discover purely through introspection. You have to have experiences - you have to learn real-time and through experiences what makes you tick.","The only people I've ever met who are really successful in their fields, regardless of what field that is, are people who are deeply passionate about the work they do every day and are motivated by a sense of purpose.","It's always a huge red flag for me when somebody's reticent or reluctant or a little slow in providing thoughtful references that are a testament to them as a person and their professional accomplishments.","I've had friends of mine hire people that I know well or that have worked for me, and I haven't gotten the call to do a reference check. That's almost the most basic thing one can do to assess them.","Mis-hiring is a huge mistake. It's a tremendous opportunity cost throwing the position to the wrong person. It's often something that isn't rectified for a long period of time.","I have the good fortune of working with two brothers who are very accomplished, incredibly smart, and very capable.","I've successfully convinced others to let me redevelop the historic Old Post Office Pavilion on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, D.C. I also led the acquisition of the iconic 800-acre Doral Resort & Spa from my hospital bed after giving birth to my daughter, Arabella.","Yes, negotiating is about money and the bottom line, but a lot of times, it's much more emotional and complex than that. Realizing that the economic outcome may not be the other party's top priority gives you more chips to play with and will enable you to achieve better results than you may have anticipated.","When people are uncomfortable - and many people are when they have to negotiate - they start rambling as a way to fill the vacuum of silence. Some of the strongest negotiators I know just sit back and listen. The less they engage, the more likely the other person is to slip up and offer information they otherwise would have kept guarded.","I've had deals over the years where I just haven't had good chemistry with the person across the table from me, so I've said to one of my brothers, 'You know what, you will be more effective than I will.' And that takes a level of confidence.","In my role as executive vice president of development and acquisitions for the Trump Organization and founder and CEO of my own lifestyle brand, I've had a lot of practice negotiating.","The iconic Doral was once a beacon for the ultimate in luxury golf resorts, and we have fully restored it to its prior grandeur - and then some. Besides the sun, golf, and amazing Latin food, Miami is a city of culture that has something for everyone.","BLT Prime at Trump National Doral is essential after a long day on the golf course. The popover bread alone is enough to keep me coming back!","Since my family owns the Trump National Doral, I spend a lot of time on the course. Trump Doral's Golf Shop is the largest pro shop in the country and carries limited-edition pieces and exclusive brands.","I have two young children, and they both adore books. Reading together at bedtime is one of our favorite nightly rituals. 'Goodnight, Goodnight Construction Site' by Sherri Duskey Rinker, 'The Giving Tree' by Shel Silverstein, and 'On The Night You Were Born' by Nancy Tillman are always on our list.","For my first fragrance, I wanted to capture the essence of a woman's strength and beauty.","My diet has definitely become greener; however, I am a big proponent of everything in moderation. I enjoy having a farm-to-table dinner, as well as indulging in a special, decadent treat on occasion.","I pretty much only drink water, Tazo passion tea, or coffee with half and half, and it's an ongoing joke in the office that I never have less than three glasses of water and some form of tea or coffee in front of me.","Basically, when I get home I just do emails for around three hours, which stinks. I have a thing about getting into your inbox every night before going to bed. I'm usually working from my laptop or my phone, desperately trying to get my inbox to zero before I fall asleep.","Usually, if I can't fall asleep, you will find me catching up on a good book or zoning out with an episode of 'The Real Housewives.' I always have a couple books on my bedside table in various stages of completion.","I recently discovered Artkive, a wonderful app that allows you to archive your child's artwork and create cool gifts like photo albums, mugs, mousepads, etc. It's very easy to use, and since Arabella is such a talented artist, I'm a pro!","My husband and I work to keep our weekends pretty unscheduled, which leaves room for spontaneity. I love low-key mornings at home, making breakfast with my kids, snuggling together in bed, and reading the papers.","The Trump World Tower was home growing up, and it's where my office is.","I listen to music - Lady Gaga, Kanye, Jay-Z, the Beatles, Robert Plant - while I'm walking down Fifth Avenue to my office in the Trump Tower early each morning.","I try to live in the present. I learn from my mistakes in an effort not to repeat them, but I remain totally focused on today and tomorrow. Many of my mistakes turned out to be incredible opportunities for growth, both professionally and personally, and therefore, in hindsight, they were deeply valuable.","There are some areas of the world, and some areas in America, where people love full jewelry suites. That's never been something that I've gravitated toward, but I will create special collections for people who like that.","When I was in my 20s, I felt guilty if I didn't exercise - now I feel guilty if I do. It's time I could be spending with my family.","I get bored easily, so in general, I tend to mix up my workouts. I exercise in the gym with a trainer once a week when I'm in town, and I love yoga, golf and tennis.","Our brand Ivanka Trump is committed to celebrating women.","I want my children to see me first every morning, so I wake up at 5 and make sure to shower and exercise before they get up.","I tried a juice cleanse, and it was a total disaster. For the eight hours that I lasted, I felt like I was on the brink of starvation. For me, it's about making the right choices.","I find that often, room service menus are highly condensed. They tend to be a little bit fast food-oriented, even at the finest hotels.","I visited 20 countries while I was pregnant. I had to stop after my seventh month."],"Ivar Giaever":["There are just two things you can do to win a Nobel prize - have a good idea and pursue it effectively.","You need to be curious, competitive, creative, stubborn, self-confident, skeptical, patient and be lucky to win a Nobel.","My own beliefs are that the road to a scientific discovery is seldom direct and that it does not necessarily require great expertise. In fact, I am convinced that often a newcomer to a field has a great advantage because he is ignorant and does not know all the complicated reasons why a particular experiment should not be attempted.","I would say that, basically, global warming is a non-problem.","Global warming has become a new religion. We frequently hear about the number of scientists who support it. But the number is not important: only whether they are correct is important. We don't really know what the actual effect on the global temperature is. There are better ways to spend the money.","When I was 28 years old, I found myself in Schenectady, New York, where I discovered that it was possible for some people to make a good living as physicists.","If I have learned anything as a scientist, it is that one should not make things complicated when a simple explanation will do.","While classical mechanics correctly predicts the behavior of large objects such as tennis balls, to predict the behavior of small objects such as electrons, we must use quantum mechanics.","I don't really know what the future of science is. Maybe we have come to the end of science; maybe science is a finite field. The inventions resulting from this finite field, however, are boundless.","There are 15 main theories in physics, and we know all of them. If there weren't a finite number of theories, there would not be a point to physics.","Science is to find something unknown, while invention is to make something new out of the known theory.","Understanding truth is the primary objective of science, not doing good for the world.","'Incontrovertible' is not a scientific word. Nothing is incontrovertible in science.","If you want to help Africa, you should help them out of poverty, not try to build solar cells and windmills.","If you're a physicist, for heaven's sake, and here is the experiment, and you have a theory, and the theory doesn't agree with the experiment, then you have to cut out the theory. You were wrong with the theory."],"Iveta Radicova":["If we have a common currency, the main regulator for policy in the country is the fiscal policy.","From my point of view it's impossible to cut debt in a country with new debt from another country.","We need first of all the reform of our justice system. We need reform of the education system, because of quality of education because of innovation and technology. And we need administrative reform. Too much bureaucracy.","It is the entire euro zone system which is under threat at the moment, not just a few small countries anymore... Our euro is under threat. The changing situation needs a quick and immediate reaction.","If another euro country fails, so does Slovakia. Our economy is 80% open and if the citizens of Spain and Portugal have no money to buy cars made here in Slovakia then that will be bad for us. Everything is connected.","In some countries we have had the right to vote for less than 100 years, so the entry of women into political leadership has caused a tsunami."],"Ivica Dacic":["I have no private life, as I am constantly under police surveillance.","Serbia will neither allow a revision of history, nor will it forget who are the main culprits in World War I.","No one can undermine national unity.","There has been enough blood in the Balkans. Serbia is offering its hand. Let us turn to the future and not deal with the past.","As prime minister, I will never make a decision that will be an injustice to Serbia and its citizens.","I tried to go to Kosovo to establish a statue to commemorate those who died during the wars, and to discuss moving on, so we could move into a new era. But I was banned from there.","A final and long-lasting solution to the Kosovo issue cannot be achieved without an agreement with Serbia, especially in regard to the U.N.","Serbia has become a pariah nation, untouchable like a leper.","There can be no unified southeastern Europe without Yugoslavia, and everything else is a continuation of political blackmail with which the Serb people and Yugoslavia were faced all these years.","Serbia is open for business.","Serbia stands firmly on the EU path.","Serbia is blamed in advance for everything.","I invite you to leverage Serbia because we have talented young professionals who are multilingual, highly educated, and willing to work for competitive wages.","Milosevic did not die in The Hague - he was killed in The Hague. But, he had managed to defend the national and state interests of Serbia and the Serb people, and everybody should be grateful to him for that.","No one has the right to detract the attention of the nation from the defence of the country.","The Serbian people certainly will never be an obstacle for the Montenegrins to have their own country.","Had someone from Serbia flown a 'Greater Serbia' flag in Tirana or Pristina, it would become an issue for the U.N. Security Council.","An international presence in Serbia's Kosovo province is not a problem. But only a civilian and unarmed mission under U.N. auspices, with Russia's participation, would be acceptable.","If Nord Stream was built in Europe, I see no reason why South Stream cannot be built as well.","Serbia has shown enough patience, but it has also sent a clear and strong message that the law must be respected and that no one is stronger than the state.","For 10 years, Kosovo was taboo. No one could officially tell the truth.","Serbs can only leave Kosovo.","The time of Milosevic has long passed.","How can a country that is impoverished, humiliated and beaten defend its national interests?","We would like Serbia to become a member of the European Union as quickly as possible.","Discussing economic reforms in Serbia is futile.","I was part of a government that tried to resolve the question of Kosovo by war. Perhaps there is some justice that today I should be the person most responsible for finding a peaceful solution."],"Ivo Andric":["Sadness is also a kind of defence.","Searching for what I need, and I don't even know precisely what that is, I was going from a man to a man, and I saw that all of them together have less than me who has nothing, and that I left to each of them a bit of that what I don't have and I've been searching for.","When I am not desperate, I am worthless.","What can and doesn't have to be always, at the end, surrenders to something that has to be.","Between the fear that something would happen and the hope that still it wouldn't, there is much more space than one thinks. On that narrow, hard, bare and dark space a lot of us spend their lives.","Lands of great discoveries are also lands of great injustices.","If people would know how little brain is ruling the world, they would die of fear.","One shouldn't be afraid of the humans. Well, I am not afraid of the humans, but of what is inhuman in them.","There is no rule without revolts and conspiracies, even as there is no property without work and worry."],"Ivo Daalder":["Donald Trump has proven adept at mobilizing anti-immigrant and anti-trade sentiment among a minority of Americans into a strong movement that seeks to put the United States first in global affairs. Yet, his is not the majority's view.","One of the amazing things about September 11 is that we lacked the imagination to connect the dots and foresee it.","A big challenge in combating terrorism is learning how to think about things that we can't imagine.","We have built up, through our global engagement, a set of institutions that have been built on trust, fundamentally on trust, where allies had trust in the United States to do the right thing when it really came down to it.","The more Trump emphasises America First, the more it turns into America Alone.","Trump believes all foreigners are playing us for suckers - he sees the world as a dark place. How can you lead alliances when you keep telling your allies they are ripping you off?","America is a country of immigrants. It's what makes America unique.","The only place I've ever been where people were as proud about their city as people are in Chicago is Florence, Italy, where I lived for three years.","Anybody who has been to Chicago has a very positive view. But not everybody has come to Chicago, and in many ways, Chicago is an undiscovered treasure. It punches below its weight internationally.","On climate change, the science is clearer about what you need to do to get a real impact than... on counterterrorism.","We have not been a normal country when it comes to engagement in the world.","Our fundamental goal in getting involved in Bosnia in the summer of 1995 was to end the war. Richard Holbrooke's fundamental goal was to negotiate a peace: a peace that was sustaining and self-sustaining over the long term.","Terrorists are everywhere and, emphatically, not only in Iraq.","President Trump is hardly the first U.S. president to call on the European allies to do more - in one form or another, every president since Harry Truman has done so. What is different this time, however, is Trump's suggestion that America's commitment to the alliance is conditional.","Many observers believe that the greatest damage Russia has done to U.S. interests in recent years stems from the Kremlin's interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential race. Although there is no question that Moscow's meddling in American elections is deeply worrying, it is just one aspect of the threat Russia poses.","Under Vladimir Putin, Russia has embarked on a systematic challenge to the West. The goal is to weaken the bonds between Europe and the United States and among E.U. members, undermine NATO's solidarity, and strengthen Russia's strategic position in its immediate neighborhood and beyond.","Putin wants nothing less than to return Russia to the center of global politics by challenging the primacy that the United States has enjoyed since the end of the Cold War.","Syria is a signature to the Geneva Protocol of 1925, which bans the use of chemical warfare. Syria has violated that international norm. For the United States to act in response is the right thing to do, is a legitimate thing to do, and is necessary in order to uphold this very important international standard.","I follow the Cubs. Only when they play the Nationals do I have a conflict.","I think when the military ousts a sitting president, even if the sitting president is deeply unpopular, that's the definition of a coup.","I think George H. W. Bush, who I had lots of disagreements with, remarkably managed the end of the Cold War in a way that history will look back at and say, 'Wow.'","I think George H.W. Bush was confronted with some huge challenges - the invasion of Kuwait, the fall of the Berlin Wall, the fall of the Soviet Union - that he managed with great aplomb."],"Ivor Novello":["A visit to a cinema is a little outing in itself. It breaks the monotony of an afternoon or evening; it gives a change from the surroundings of home, however pleasant.","After the war, in which I served as a pilot in the Air Force, I took up films.","The crowd may be influenced easily, largely because it is a crowd.","There's something Vichy about the French.","Behind the footlights there is always the applause, which stimulates the actors. On the screen it is a different matter.","British girls are as temperamental as Americans.","Every blessed one of you feels better for that burst of laughter.","I began my career with infantile dreams of becoming a composer.","Love-making is an art which must be studied.","The average person is gregarious; there is something in the spirit of the crowd that adds to the enjoyment of entertainment.","The public must suffer untold pangs from the stiffness, the deliberate stifling of emotion, on the part of many British actors.","There are very few misanthropes, thank goodness!","Things which do not require effort of some sort are seldom worth having.","When the cinematograph first made its appearance, we were told that the days of the ordinary theatre were numbered.","You cannot isolate yourself from the crowd - even if you want to.","It has been argued that British girls are incapable of deep feeling or brilliant acting owing to their lack of temperament. This, I am positive, is not true.","The beautiful heroine might be thinking, How long must I bury my face on this wretched man's shoulder? Such is not the always the case, but quite often it is.","The cinema is an institution nowadays, with its roots sunk deep in the hearts of the millions of people who find enjoyment and entertainment in going to the pictures.","The inconvenience, the glaring lights, the long hours of waiting, and the repetition of every scene are all calculated to defeat anything more than a real mastery of love technique.","We were asked to believe that the variety and the novelty of even the crude films of the early days would provide a means of entertainment which would cut out the stage.","A couple of seats at a good picture house cost comparatively little but give a generous return in the shape of freshened minds and freedom from the worries that even the best regulated homes cannot always avoid.","Actors who are lovers in real life are often incapable if playing the part of lovers to an audience. It is equally true that sympathy between actors who are not lovers may create a temporary emotion that is perfectly sincere.","Television, they say, will permit a person to be entertained at home, without the effort of going to a picture house, without the trouble of booking seats, without the presence of other people.","There is an atmosphere about the picture theatre that speaks of entertainment and relaxation. The charming surroundings, good music, and the fact that each visitor is determined to enjoy a few hours of holiday all exert an influence on the mind."],"Ivy Compton-Burnett":["A leopard does not change his spots, or change his feeling that spots are rather a credit.","My youth is escaping without giving me anything it owes me.","There is more difference within the sexes than between them.","Time is not a great healer. It is an indifferent and perfunctory one. Sometimes it does not heal at all. And sometimes when it seems to, no healing has been necessary.","There is probably nothing like living together for blinding people to each other.","People who have power respond simply. They have no minds but their own.","At a certain point my novels set. They set just as hard as that jam jar. And then I know they are finished.","There isn't much to say. I haven't been at all deedy.","Well, of course, people are only human... But it really does not seem much for them to be."],"Ivy Lee":["Write down the most important things you have to do tomorrow.","Don't worry if you don't complete everything on the schedule. At least you will have completed the most important projects before getting to the less important ones."],"Iwan Rheon":["I wasn't, you know, Mr. Popular. I was somewhere in the middle ground. I was quite alternative, the things I liked to do. Skateboarding, at the time. Playing in a band as opposed to playing in the rugby team. You know, that kind of thing.","Playing live is closer to theatre, although when you're up there on your own, it's quite scary and revealing because you're playing your own songs. It's like a one man show that you've written yourself.","When I was a teenager, I wanted to be a rock star, not an actor. It means I can do what I want on my own terms.","I'm still secretly a bit of a punk. Love The Clash and a bit of the Pistols. I guess as I've got older I've chilled out a bit. But, my teenage angst is still stirring somewhere!","I was a huge Radiohead fan growing up.","The first CD I had was 'Definitely Maybe' by Oasis, and I had a tape of' 'Parklife' by Blur when I was nine.","I listen to a lot of reggae.","When you write a song, there's no point keeping it to yourself.","I don't want to put any pressure on the music; it's my hobby and my release - a thing that I love.","I just want my music to be put out there, not shoved in people's faces. I want to keep it relaxed.","I have no ambitions to be a pop star.","I'm always drawn towards the darker stuff, because I think it's just a lot more interesting. But it's also good fun doing the comedy, and I think that's why 'Misfits' has been great in that way, as you get a really good balance. I think it's best to try and do everything as an actor, really.","I started off from a very early age listening to music - all the usual cheesy stuff that little kids like.","There was so much great music around in the '60s, stuff like The Small Faces, but I also love The Jam."],"Iyad Allawi":["We are safer, the region is safer, the world is safer without Saddam.","We are succeeding in Iraq. Thank you, America.","We are succeeding in Iraq. It's a tough struggle with setbacks, but we are succeeding.","It is our people who are sitting in the dark because of these cowardly and treacherous attacks, not our occupiers.","Saddam Hussein's trial would not be public since he could name countries and persons whom he gave money.","These are facts, these are not imaginary things.","We are losing each day an average 50 to 60 people throughout the country, if not more. If this is not civil war, then God knows what civil war is.","We see an extensive program of dismantling state institutions... These are ingredients for catastrophe.","With nearly 20 days until Iraq emerges as a free sovereign state for the first time in more than three decades, terrorists have increasingly targeted our country's infrastructure."],"Iyanla Vanzant":["In my deepest, darkest moments, what really got me through was a prayer. Sometimes my prayer was 'Help me.' Sometimes a prayer was 'Thank you.' What I've discovered is that intimate connection and communication with my creator will always get me through because I know my support, my help, is just a prayer away.","I gave myself permission to feel and experience all of my emotions. In order to do that, I had to stop being afraid to feel. In order to do that, I taught myself to believe that no matter what I felt or what happened when I felt it, I would be okay.","All of us have ways in which we mask and cover our pain.","I have learned the hard way to mind my business, without judging who people are and what they do. I am more troubled by the lack of space being provided for the truth to unfold. Humans cannot seem to wait for or honor the truth. Instead, we make it up based on who we believe people should or should not be.","When you gossip, it's self-hexing. Because when you do it, it comes back to you. Everything starts with the word. The word is demonstrating a condition of the mind. If it's in your mind and comes out of your mouth, it will be created.","The remedy for life's broken pieces is not classes, workshops or books. Don't try to heal the broken pieces. Just forgive.","You know that you've healed an issue when you can talk about it and you're not weeping, when you can speak to it and identify the lesson. You know that you've healed an issue when, having gone through that, has a benefit that you live today.","My purpose is to teach and demonstrate what is possible. To demonstrate love of God and good. Remember what my role is as a woman: to be... good. My role as a mother: to teach, support and nurture my offspring. My role as a grandmother: to remind everybody - right where you are, God is.","I'm really not that fierce.","I've seen the good, the bad, and the ugly. Lived it and I'm still here to talk about it and help someone else if I can.","For most of my life, I believed that my father had broken many of my bones. They were emotional and psychological bones; things no one could see, things that caused me to limp through life clutching for and holding on to people and situations that often rendered me immobile.","The thing I always tell my audiences all the time is that I'm just two steps ahead of you on a good day. And I might be two steps behind you on a bad day.","Everybody's got a 'thing.' Some 'things' are nice and quiet. Some 'things' have fangs and claws. Some 'things' stink and have slobber everywhere.","Comparison is an act of violence against the self.","In my mind, marriage is a spiritual partnership and union in which we willingly give and receive love, create and share intimacy, and open ourselves to be available and accessible to another human being in order to heal, learn and grow.","You have a right to say no. Most of us have very weak and flaccid 'no' muscles. We feel guilty for saying no. We get ostracized and challenged for saying no, so we forget it's our choice. Your 'no' muscle has to be built up to get to a place where you can say, 'I don't care if that's what you want. I don't want that. No.'","You've got to know what your 'thing' is, and you've got to call it a 'thing,' whether it's meanness, nastiness, un-forgiveness, arrogance, ego, resistance, rebelliousness or defiance. Everybody's got a 'thing,' and once you call your 'thing' a 'thing,' we can give it a place to be or dismiss it.","I surround people in unconditional acceptance and love to such a degree that everything that is unloving about them rises to the surface.","Gossip is when you have a malice of intent or mindless, third-party conversation to someone about someone, something you haven't said to that someone.","In order to feel loved, be respected and stay connected, we humans have a tendency to lie. We lie about who we are, what we want, what we need, what we have done or will do. Perhaps 'lie' is too strong a word. Let me say that what we do is withhold the truth.","A stable and nurturing childhood is essential for the healthy psycho-emotional and spiritual development of a human being. While we may understand what is supposed to happen to us physically, we must begin to better understand what happens to children mentally, emotionally and spiritually as a result of the families into which they are born.","After being on 'Oprah' for a couple of months, I got my first royalty check for $1,478,392.17. I will never forget it. At the height of my career, I made $3.3 million. Unbelievable. From welfare in the projects to $3.3 million.","Order is the first law of heaven, and you have to have order to survive on Earth. Figure out what has to be done each day, each week, each year and develop a system to achieve it.","You know when I was 20 and 30, they were insecurities. Now they're just a new normal. I'm 60 years old, so my expectations of who I am and how I look and how I show up in the world had to shift. Not because I couldn't help it, or not because I did anything wrong, but because I had to get into the natural flow of my being as a woman.","Some of us pray demands. Some of us pray complaints. Some of us pray knowing, and some of us pray not knowing. But prayer is the attitude that you hold in your heart.","One of the ways that people avoid taking responsibility for their role in their own pain is what I call the BPs - blame and projection.","At times I have long conversations with God. Sometimes I ask questions. I admit that there are also times when I let out my frustrations, fears, and anxieties in less than honorable ways. No matter what I pray about or how I pray about it, the result I always get is comfort.","I hope that my story, I hope that my life is... an encouragement for people, especially in Brooklyn. I feel humbled and blessed.","Everyone has something that blocks us from the full experience and expression of our nobility.","I knew all of the childhood prayers I uttered on my knees at the side of my bed. Many years of Sunday-school attendance had etched certain Psalms and rote prayers into the fibers of my brain. However, somewhere deep inside of me, I had the secret belief that I did not know how to pray, and that frightened me.","I'm focusing on healing lives and teaching people that they can heal - giving them tools to heal.","I took my kids everywhere. I didn't have money for child care, so I took them to college with me and they sat in the hallway.","I've always wanted people to know who they are from the inside. Then they can create the life they desire and deserve. I've always believed that my job was to facilitate the evolution of the human consciousness.","I think as men begin to see things that address them, they will feel that they can relate. They can't relate to 'Basketball Wives,' 'Housewives of Atlanta.' I am not judging or criticizing those shows at all; what I am saying is the perspective is not necessarily the male perspective. 'Iyanla: Fix My Life' is inclusive of everyone.","What I am doing; how I am being as I am doing it; and does it bring honor to my community? What is the lesson in what I am doing? And most importantly, am I having fun?","I really don't have any weaknesses. I do have areas of my life that I am working on to grow, heal and evolve. Giving myself permission to rest is an area I am working on. Not rescuing my children and grandchildren is another area.","You know, if you're a human and living on the planet, it doesn't matter what you do; you are not immune to the challenges, the trials, the difficulty. And that fact that I happen to be a coach and a minister and a spiritual teacher doesn't mean anything. I'm still human.","If you're not willing to let your partner see your cellulite or know your biggest fears, then you aren't really ready to share yourself.","Begin within. If it shows up in your life, it's coming to tell you something about you that you're acting like you don't know. Something about yourself, or your relationship with God.","We really don't know how to love each other because we haven't really learned to love ourselves. In many instances, not all, it's not malicious. We've just been conditioned to such bad behavior.","Sometimes we pray in our heads and we never get a real opportunity to solidify what it is that we're praying for or what we're praying about. So once you write it down, it's like a flow. It comes out and you solidify the thought or the idea or the request.","I think most people think that a spiritual path or growing spiritually means that all of a sudden you'll be able to forecast the six lotto numbers and all your bills will be paid.","There is a lot of healing going on. Really! More people are vegetarians, more are in the green movement, more of us are tearing down the old paradigms and embracing same-sex marriage, single motherhood, men raising babies.","I grew up in the Holiness Church, where prayer was an event.","People say I've had a difficult time in life. I think I've had an exciting time in life.","I had to stop traveling alone because I missed so many planes. When somebody runs up to you in the airport and begins to tell you their life story, you can't say, 'Excuse me, boo,' as they're weeping on your bosom.","I wasn't ready for fame and all that brings to your life. It was an amazing experience, but so overwhelming, because no one can tell you beforehand when it will happen or how it will impact you. So no one can tell you how to handle it, being stopped everywhere you go because people saw you on 'Oprah.' It took me over, and I wasn't ready.","Be willing to share all of who you are. So many of us want a partner, but we're not willing to show all of us.","Any time there is 'un-forgiveness' between people who love each other, there is suffering. Any time people face challenges that they really don't understand... there is suffering.","Well the beauty of 'Iyanla: Fix My Life' is that men are in every show. To our surprise, some of the deepest healing demonstrations have been with the men - the sons, the fathers, the husbands - because they agree to participate with the wife or the daughter or whatever it is we are looking at, and it is there.","All things are lessons that God would have us learn.","What a blessing that God allows a life to come through your body, and then allows you to place that body in a body bag and take it out. I had to say that there's a magnificent something that God has for me to do, to give me that level of completion. That level of experience. It's unspeakable.","When Oprah Winfrey tells you that you need to have your own show, you feel compelled to do it. Especially if she's gonna pay for it!","I have a daily message, 'Stimumail,' which I use to stimulate the mind and heart. I have the opportunity to touch over 60,000 people I have never met. I also use Twitter and Facebook.","Oprah Winfrey gives you the stage? Shut your mouth. I said, 'I'm sorry for taking over your show.' She said, 'No, that's why we have you here.'","I had no preconceived idea what fame would be like, because I never thought I would be famous. I just wanted to do my work. Hell, I just wanted to pay my rent on time.","It is an honor and a privilege to be of service and support; however, I realize people are not putting their confidence in me. Instead, they are actually learning to trust themselves. My job is to affirm and support them in the process and teach them to do what I do when I need strength: I begin within.","What will support any relationship is clear, complete and conscious conversations when upsets or breakdowns occur.","In 2002, my daughter was diagnosed with a rare form of colon cancer. And it was such a shock, a surprise to us.","I realized it was happening, but most people didn't realize it was happening. I mean, because as a self-employed person, when there is a recession or a cutback in the economy, we feel it first. Because many self-employed people provide services that are nonessential.","I've always told the truth. I think that's been part of the foundation of my career. I don't put myself above people. I don't put myself different than people. And I, for one, know that none of us is immune.","If you don't like your sister or don't get along with your father, let's find out if you like yourself. Let's not sugarcoat anything about it.","I'm the person that I always was, but in terms of how I approach my living, I'm not the same person at all. At all. I've buried a child, I've ended a marriage, and the grandson that I was raising is now grown. My family has totally shifted.","I'm moving into that eldership age, you know? I'm at the 'wise woman' age where it's not about learning, but utilizing the information that I have in a way that serves other people. That's a high calling and it's a great responsibility.","I came from nothing. I came from the projects and welfare and ended up a millionaire with no frame of reference. I was bound to hit a wall sooner or later.","I don't think there's such a thing as a selfish prayer. Prayer puts you in communication so you can talk about whatever you want to talk about.","It's about your heart and about your consciousness. It's not about length of time you pray. Some of the most powerful prayers I've ever heard come from children, who can barely speak.","I try not to set myself up as different or as a celebrity or special. I have a husband that can get on my nerves. I have kids that test my patience. I've got a cat I can't keep off the sofa. It's real. On a bad day, I'm reading 'Acts of Faith.'","The show is 'Fix My Life!' Get it? Life. I do not fix people.","Why can't women get along? Because we're afraid. We're afraid to be vulnerable. We're afraid to be soft. We're afraid to be hurt. But most of all, we're afraid of our power. So we become controlling and aggressive and vicious.","At birth, we are like cartilage - soft, flexible tissue. By the same natural process by which cartilage becomes hard bone, the soft, tender heart of an innocent child can become hardened by the circumstances into which she is born.","My father never kissed me, hugged me or told me that he loved me. As my only living parent, he became the filter through which I saw myself, the possibilities for my life, the world and all men. He was a conflicted and dark filter.","Talk about your negative experiences with the father, with your girlfriends. Not with your children. And bite your tongue when it comes to diminishing, denying, dismissing, name-calling.","If you are a card-carrying human being, chances are that you share the same fear as all other humans: the fear of losing love, respect and connection to others. And if you are human, in order to avoid or prevent the pain, trauma and perceived devastation of the loss, you will do anything to avoid your greatest fear from being visited on you.","Whether at work, at home or in public, we have been trained to believe that who we are at the core of our being is often unacceptable. As a result, we work diligently to live up to - and sometimes down to - what others have made us out to be, whether or not it is an accurate reflection of who we are.","I was sitting on the bus, and the sign said if you're ready to better your life, come to Medgar Evers College, and I got off the bus and went to Medgar Evers College.","Pain is pain, hurt is hurt, fear is fear, anger is anger, and it has no color."],"Izaak Walton":["Good company in a journey makes the way seem shorter.","Good company and good discourse are the very sinews of virtue.","God has two dwellings; one in heaven, and the other in a meek and thankful heart.","Words are men's daughters, but God's sons are things.","The person that loses their conscience has nothing left worth keeping.","God never did make a more calm, quiet, innocent recreation than angling.","Angling may be said to be so like the mathematics that it can never be fully learned.","I love such mirth as does not make friends ashamed to look upon one another next morning.","No man can lose what he never had.","In so doing, use him as though you loved him.","Those little nimble musicians of the air, that warble forth their curious ditties, with which nature hath furnished them to the shame of art.","As no man is born an artist, so no man is born an angler.","I have laid aside business, and gone a'fishing.","That which is everybody's business is nobody's business."],"Izabel Goulart":["Sports have always been a big part of my life. At school, I played a lot of different sports, and I was competing with other schools. I did everything: running, volleyball, basketball, soccer, Olympic-style gymnastics, and more! My history with sports gave me good concentration, focus, strength, and motivation to stay healthy.","After a workout, I have a protein drink and always keep a protein bar in my bag.","Sometimes people can only imagine that I live a glamorous life 24/7, which I don't. I just like the most natural and simple things. That's what makes me happy.","I've never been to Thailand and I've only heard good things about it. I really want to make my way there.","I don't have any hidden talents but if you dare me to do something I'll go after it big time.","I speak English, Portuguese, and French. One day I'd love to learn Italian.","Modeling has given me the opportunity to travel outside of Brazil and see the world. I have been meeting many interesting and talented people along the way.","Diabetes is a disease that's had a deep impact on my family. My little brother has had type 1 diabetes since he was a baby and I have spent time learning about the disease and trying to bring attention to it so that one day soon we will reach a cure.","I love to sleep late, and I rarely have the chance to.","I believe that one of the saddest things in the world today is that some people don't have enough food to nourish themselves. It's the 21st century and that's really not acceptable, so if I could do something that would change that I would be really happy.","I could never stop eating meat... I'm not a good person to talk about diets. If I had to only eat salads, I'd kill myself!","I have a series of exercises in which I do a lot of core. I enjoy an ab workout. I practice every day and do many different types.","Often, I'll do a quick workout in my hotel room consisting of exercises for the legs, glutes, abs, and arms with my own body weight. Also, I always have a jump rope, a medicine ball I can inflate, and a band in my suitcase. It's a great kit to have for travel.","I was flying with my brother, and he challenged me to work out on the airplane. He thought it was funny - and I did it!","The first thing I do in the morning is prepare fresh juice. I have 15 different recipes, which I drink for 15 days consecutively. Then I repeat the recipes from the beginning for the next 15 days of the month. My juices include fruit, vegetables, leafy greens, and even grains.","I always had the most fun going to the beach on the weekends with my friends. In a way, we treated our beach style the way New Yorkers treat their street style, so I was always conscious of how I looked.","My favorite outdoor activities are running, yoga, and functional training. My favorite indoor workouts are Pilates, kickboxing, functional training, and a lot of different exercises at the gym with and without weights - including TRX."],"Izabella Scorupco":["The most simple things can bring the most happiness.","I'm so lucky to be in a situation that I can always have my daughter with me.","I've never been the sexy or the cute girl.","I was the good Bond girl, but I wanted to have the dresses and the high heels. I wanted the funky, sexy name.","I was very athletic when I was younger and I am a very competitive person, so I never give up.","He taught me how to fly on my own and learn the tricks.","I've never seen one Star Trek in my whole life.","Really. I'd love to be spoiled on by others.","You're not really supposed to like ABBA in Sweden. It's nerdy.","I never work out. I think it is boring, so I run.","When I do something I give everything, so it has to be something that I really want to go for.","I have no idea what makes a director believe in me that I can sell these kind of roles.","I've never actually seen a Star Trek, but I have seen an Alien movie.","I think it's very much a men's thing to be able to have that fantasy to kill the beast.","To be honest, I really don't like being the sex object.","If you compare my character to the others, they were sexy with designer clothes. I had the nerdy outfit.","Reign of Fire is something I know how to do, because I've played tough so much.","I had a flight trainer who is one of the biggest and most famous helicopter pilots the world.","I may be boring, but it would be to wake up by my dog and then my daughter.","We were in a relationship for eight years, and we maybe saw each other, total, for a year.","I've always been comfortable with my sexual desires and what I like.","Sexual underwear is tacky.","I have a child and I'm a parent first of all.","A lot of male actors are method actors and they become the characters which they both were.","Yes I never go to the gym otherwise because I think it's a waste of time and the most boring thing on earth.","It was never really my choice to be an action heroine.","I was born in Poland I came to Sweden when I was eight and always wanted to act and suddenly ended up in a Bond movie which was for me at that time absolutely enormous.","Well my biggest dream is to be in a romantic comedy.","After filming I like to go home and lie down with my daughter and have a glass of wine so I don't really socialize with the other actors."],"iO Tillett Wright":["Along with racial equality and the late bloom of women's rights, future generations will have to explain how, in the past, gays were misunderstood and publicly humiliated for loving each other, and, eventually, how they stood together and conquered stupidity and hypocritical hatred, and fought their way out of marginalization.","At sleepovers I would have panic attacks trying to break it to girls that they didn't want to kiss me without outing myself.","We are neurologically hardwired to seek out people like ourselves. We start forming cliques as soon as we're old enough to know what acceptance feels like. We bond together based on anything that we can - music preference, race, gender, the block that we grew up on.","I was part of a show called 'Manifest Equality' in Los Angeles in 2010, and I realized there was a disconnect between people who are gay or have gay friends and are gay-friendly, and people who think they don't know any gay people.","I was born and raised in Manhattan; I didn't realize that I, in all my androgyny, was a freak to the rest of this country.","All I'm ever looking for in my work in general is honesty and truth and people being real to themselves.","It's illegal to be gay in Little Rock - this is such a reality for so many people, but once people get to these bubbles of New York or L.A. or Boulder, Colorado, they forget.","Where I come from, if you weren't a drag queen or a radical thinker or a performance artist of some kind, you were the weirdo.","For me, photography is not just about exposing film, it's about exposing the viewer to something new, a place they haven't gone before, but most importantly, to people that they might be afraid of."]}
