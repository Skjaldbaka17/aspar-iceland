{"Yael Cohen":["I am always personalizing tees to fit my personality, cutting off rocker shirts, debunking the mold of what traditional 'work wear' means, and always wearing my cause.","When I graduated, I promptly took a job in finance, making both my pre-med and poli-sci years essentially useless - or so I thought.","I was going to be a doctor since I was three, so I was pre-med in college. Everything I did, every class I took, pointed toward the 'holy M.D.' Friends were taking wine-tasting classes, studying human sexuality, or redefining their views of the world in poli-sci, and I was memorizing anatomy and crying over o-chem.","I'm pretty sure my mom is the only person on the planet who thinks that she got cancer so that I could find my calling in life, but as I started to build this company, all my years of useless education, random jobs, and weird interests merged into this serendipitous moment.","Nobody talks about cancer until they have to, and then, it's really all you can talk about.","I start every morning off with a green juice, because I think it's really important to be alkalined, and then I work out. We teach people that you need to find that balance and that what you put into your body is directly affecting your health.","At night, I don't do business meetings, because I think it sends the wrong message. I do dinner with friends, game night, or concerts.","Sometimes I'll hike in the afternoon if I have meetings with New York in the morning.","I spend time on campaign creation and implementation, anything from sitting down with the agency or with creative companies. I also meet with supporters. We've been really lucky to have various high-profile supporters.","The first step is really getting our generation to talk to our parents about cancer. Because our research has shown that parents are much more likely to get that diagnostic test or stay on top of their risk profile if it comes from a child.","More than 90% of cancers are curable at stage one - look for them, look for them, look for them.","The fact that my mother's life was cut short is something that pushes me to always move forward and live the best life I possibly can. In a way, I feel like I can take her along with me through every experience, and in that sense, her beautiful energy and spirit will live on.","There have been so many incredible moments since the start of this organization. One that stands out specifically is when an anonymous businessman triple-matched our donation to Memorial Sloan Kettering after our NYC event.","One of the most beautiful experiences our family shared was feeling the love and bond that came to life when my mother was battling her ovarian cancer. In a way, it brought our family together and opened up relationships and a closeness that was not felt before her diagnosis.","We want to keep creating the biggest impact we can in the cancer space by focuses on prevention, early detection, and psychosocial support.","Cancer is something none of us are prepared to deal with. We're here to help people through the process.","We get so obsessed with our body, but when you have cancer, you forget your mind and your soul and your relationships are all affected. We will continue to build on and create more resources on topics like, 'How do you talk about cancer?'","How do you support someone with cancer? How do you ask for the help you need?","I wanted to create a movement and a safe space for people to come and find their 'cancer home.'","I never intended on starting a charity; I never intended on cancer, health, and wellness becoming my life.","Our parents, loved ones, and friends are getting cancer. So we need to know how to care for them, support them, and understand what the hell is going on. I don't think it's that hard to reach them: you have to go where they are - online. You have to speak their language - humour, wit, and edge. And you have to be honest, authentic and bold.","StandWith has two main functions: first, updates which allows the caregiver to send out patient updates to their community in a simple way that eliminated dozens of texts, emails and calls. The second is tasks. A caregiver can request a task to be fulfilled and their community can self-select which they complete based off their abilities and means.","I think I'm generally more inspired when I'm away from technology. Whether that is on a beach somewhere or just in your room with your phones and screens shut off, I think that quietness is often very inspiring.","I think that we get so distracted with our smartphones... It takes your body and your brain time to switch between tasks. If we can focus on what we're doing, we'll be more productive at that task.","'Washio' provides laundry and dry cleaning on demand. They pick it up, clean it, and return it within 24 hours - and often with a cookie. No more forgetting to pick up the dry-cleaning or wasting time in line.","'Postmates' will provide you with any food you can imagine - delivered. Frozen yogurt craving? Need coffee and no time to run? Last minute dinner guests and no food in the house? They take care of it all. Easy and awesome. I'm a fan.","Having been a caregiver more times than I care to count, 'StandWith' lets caregivers and patients easily update their community and post targeted tasks that community members can accept."],"Yael Grobglas":["Honestly, I'd love to say I live this amazing Hollywood lifestyle, but actually, I'm at home with my same friends and cooking. I crochet, I do watercolor. I think what surprised me the most is that that isn't the lifestyle everyone necessarily lives.","Back home, almost everything I did, I did in Hebrew. I went to drama school in Hebrew, my whole career was in Hebrew, and to switch languages was something that was fascinating and more complicated than I expected it to be, even though I've been speaking English since I could speak.","Israel has a fantastic film industry, and many times we are known for our political films or films that have to do with the army. I love the fact that we can show that there are films coming out of Israel that are just for fun.","As an actor, the first thing you're taught is, 'Don't look into the camera; ignore it.'","I feel like if I consider myself comfortable in something, then that's not exactly where I want to be. And in 'Jane the Virgin' specifically, I feel like I don't have to choose... We get to do drama and comedy sometimes within the same thirty seconds.","I'm usually cast for the more goofy and tomboyish characters."],"Yael Naim":["I thought I was an old soul, and that I knew life, but then starting the real life, I figured I am completely new.","In France, I found there is a lot of attention to the little details and to the quality of life.","Hebrew is my first language, so it's really the most personal and the most simple. When I write in Hebrew, I don't look for sophistication in music; it's just pure emotion that comes out.","Today, computers help us making the music. It's really a tool.","When I write in Hebrew, I don't look for sophistication in music; it's just pure emotion that comes out.","Being from Israel and a Jew is complex already, but with France, there is a freedom and a mix of culture. I have met musicians from all over the world.","My big influences are Joni Mitchell, and a lot of classical and Indian music, as well as Nina Simone and the personal blues and jazz of Billie Holiday. Other influences for me include Bjork, Nick Drake, and Sufjan Stevens.","Songs are a way to express what I have felt. A way to understand what happened to me or to other people.","English is really free for me; there's no limits to the music and the imagination. And French, it's just I live in Paris, and it's really a poetic language where you can really play with words.","As always, I wrote songs. Some people cook or play sports. This is what I love to do. Sometimes I can't express myself that well in talk, so I write songs.","When I'd go to Israel, I felt like a tourist. My social and professional ties had started to dissolve, and it confused me. I didn't know whether I should stay here in Paris or go back to Israel, or even cut off all my ties with Israel so I could really plant roots here. Or maybe go somewhere else altogether.","My first album was full of ideas and attempts to go in all kinds of directions. I was young. I loved making music, but I didn't have a clear path. I also lacked in confidence.","I don't hide my being Israeli. I say it in every interview. I put out a record with songs in Hebrew. The people who signed me have no connection to Judaism or Israel.","I had arrived years ago in Paris and just wanted to be famous, fast. When you're pretentious like that, and you think you've planned everything perfectly, it's then that everything goes in the opposite way.","Usually when a song comes to me, I don't ask a lot of questions; I hear something, and I just let it out in song. It's like making a salad. Everything I hear, and everything I am, I mix together in a different way in each song.","I like to sing covers of songs that are at the extreme ends from what I usually listen to.","I like finding that common point between another song and my music. It's like between people; you can be of religion or another, from this country or from another country, but we're all basically the same. It's just the same with songs."],"Yael Stone":["One thing that is not to be underestimated is American culture's influence on the rest of the world.","In Australia, kids play in American accents.","Prison makes an interesting context for so many different characters to come together. You get to see what lines get drawn between people.","It's really interesting working in television as opposed to the theater, where you know the arc of the character and you are able to create this whole backstory.","I've definitely had those moments when I think a relationship with somebody is one way, and then it just flips.","My working history as an actor is definitely in the theatre; it certainly was in Australia.","Australia has a very big history of incarceration. What does that mean to us? What does it mean that we came over to a country that's not necessarily ours and filled it with white prisoners?","I never want to be anywhere else than in the rehearsal room. I mean, it's so lame to say, but it makes me supremely happy to work with people and to talk and invent and laugh.","Family hang-outs can go very late into the night and involve lots of music."],"Yahoo Serious":["Now both my films have been number one at the Australian box office and it took about two years just to get the finance for this film, so if it's hard for me then God help everyone else.","So we have to be careful because if you don't protect your culture you won't have it for very long.","All the jokes in my films, the comedy, they're not me, I just try to hold a big mirror up to us.","My background was art school, documentary director and surfer with a keen interest in thrilling acts of life threatening stupidity.","It's an infinite creative universe to explore so why chase conservative options?","In 1905 Albert discovered Relativity, in 1906 he invented Rock and Roll.","It's because we are so flooded with American culture that we're startled when we see ourselves up there on the screen.","The American formula things are out there but they don't have any stories to tell - we have all the stories to tell - but they're all formula.","While the eyes of the world will be on us let's show everyone that we have a great sense of humour.","I don't know what it means to be out there against the Olympics.","I kind of worry about that a little bit - we lost our film culture for 30 years because the Americans came in and bought up all the cinema chains and wouldn't show any Australian films.","In a kind of a way there's a bit of that happening now so we have to be careful to preserve our culture.","I just wanted to do this all Australian film and we didn't want to give creative control to overseas 'cause whoever comes on my sets, whether you're sweeping the floor or an actor, it doesn't matter who comes up with the ideas, it's a collaboration.","You go overseas and people are oppressed and scared and worried but we're not like that... we're more like my films and how people come out at the end of seeing them - they feel good.","Australians don't have a preconceived notion of what things have to be... we can go on a fantastic journey.","We live in a time where government is not a leadership thing, it's more a business that's out there and running riot, so I guess the people have to go out there and say stuff.","We cheer everyone who goes off to Hollywood and tells American stories but telling Australian stories is the greatest thing you can do.","Can you imagine what it would be like if all the Aussie film talent was able to make Australian stories?","We've got so many stories to tell, you know, we could take on the world.","If government and media and all of us in the Australian tribe got together, and the rock industry, we'd just be the greatest cultural force the world has ever seen - we're such an amazing race.","I support all Australian films.","Hollywood is horrible... it's beyond satire.","It was always easy for me. I was born very rich and lucky.","Movies are usually difficult, often insane, constantly challenging and always strangely amusing to make.","The obsession required to see a feature through from concept to release is not a rational thing to do with your brief time on this planet. Nor is it something to which an intelligent person should aspire.","Making your first feature film is actually impossible.","Then if your movie clicks with real audiences, you'll be sucked into some sort of Hollywood orbit. It's a devil of a place where the only religion that really counts is box office.","Movies are a complicated collision of literature, theatre, music and all the visual arts.","Find your own specific voice in filmmaking and go for it. Either people will get it or they won't and that's what it's all about.","Getting your screenplay right is the most important thing you'll ever do on your film.","Three years after starting, by physically doing everything from raising the finance to special effects, we'd finally cobbled together our low budget film.","The journey of your first movie is not just beyond belief it can be truly beyond satire.","There are a thousand weird untold stories in the Australian film industry, this has been one of them."],"Yahya Jammeh":["My fate is in the hands of almighty Allah.","Apartheid was in South Africa; now it has been transferred to Palestine.","As far as I am concerned, LGBT can only stand for leprosy, gonorrhea, bacteria, and tuberculosis, all of which are detrimental to human existence.","I am not a witch doctor, and in fact, you cannot have a witch doctor. You are either a witch or a doctor.","My fate is in the hands of almighty Allah. I will deliver to the Gambian people and if I have to rule this country for one billion years, I will, if Allah says so.","Allowing homosexuality means allowing satanic rights.","Homosexuality is anti-humanity.","What brought the British to the Gambia in the first place - which was bigger than it is now - was trade in ivory because the Gambia had a lot of elephants. They wiped out all the elephants and ended up selling Africans.","Some people go to the West and claim they are gays and that their lives are at risk in the Gambia, in order for them to be granted a stay in Europe.","Despite all odds we have emerged as one people and one country.","May we be saved from evil thoughts and deed of enemies of world peace who find pleasure in creating havoc and perpetrating all forms of carnage.","Homosexuals are not welcome in the Gambia.","If you don't show care and love for your children and leave the mothers to take care of all their needs, if they grow up, they will also not consider you.","If I want to ban any newspaper, I will, with good reason.","Any one who wants to live in peace and freedom will be to live by toil, demonstration of high levels of discipline and tolerance for one another.","I have never seen homosexual chicken or turkey.","I can cure AIDS, and I will.","I will develop the areas that vote for me, but if you don't vote for me, don't expect anything.","You cannot be in your offices every day doing nothing... and at the end of the day you expect to be paid.","When your neighbour's house is on fire, you should help with a bucket of water.","Our forefathers used to live longer and healthy lives.","Today, the origin of 90% of all the edible food Gambians consume are from places they have never heard of.","Most of the sicknesses we suffer from are from the things we eat.","The missile that downed the Malaysian plane, they say, is a Russian-made missile. But the weapons that are used in the barbarism in the barbaric act against the Palestinians were made by the West, and nobody is blaming them. Nobody talks about it; not even the U.N. Security Council can pass a resolution against Israel!","Every Westerner is jubilating that the Berlin Wall has fallen. Something worst than the Berlin Wall is in Palestine; and nobody is talking about it.","I don't believe in killing people. I believe in locking you up for the rest of your life."],"Yair Lapid":["The Holocaust changed our perception of morality not only because we discovered that morality is the only thing that can stand up to the ultimate evil, but also because it shifted the focus from society to the individual.","One of the things that hold together a human society is the existence of basic politeness among its members.","The win-win situation is the basis for America's entire business world. Instead of wasting our time attempting to defeat each other, let's find a way that will make both of us gain and go home satisfied. In Israel, it doesn't work because the only meaning of victory is seeing your rival's body lying trampled on the floor.","Corruption is when a politician uses public funds to deliver pistachio ice cream to his home and transfer garden furniture to his Caesarea villa, then requesting that the expenses be covered for the water in his pool and fights to get a private jet.","Holocaust survivors came to Israel in order to establish a new human society where nobody would be able to hurt them just because they're Jewish. This is both a furious and vulnerable message.","I have written to Israel's friends around the world, including the U.S. Congress and the E.U., and asked them to make funding for the United Nations dependent on ending blatant discrimination against Israel at the U.N. Human Rights Council.","I'm not telling you what to do on the Sabbath, and you won't tell me.","Arab society features apartheid of women, apartheid of homosexuals, and apartheid of Christians, Jews, and democracy.","At times, we need to stop and rethink everything. Our entire history is made up of people who were sure they knew the truth yet forgot that the truth has an annoying tendency to change on occasion without us noticing it.","When you say to Israelis, 'European boycott,' they think it means that this year they won't get Camembert cheese on time... That is not the case.","Judaism shouldn't be the jailhouse of ideas but a liberator of ideas; not a disintegrator of people but what brings people together.","I do not deal with threats and ultimatums.","When the Americans see someone like Steve Jobs or Mark Zuckerberg, who made billions thanks to their talent and determination, the first thing they say to themselves is, 'I want to be like him.' This, in many ways, is the engine that drives Western society: The desire to make it like the winners.","Israelis want peace and security, and Palestinians want peace and justice - these are two very different things, and this is the real gap we have to close.","Israeli teachers are not required to hold an academic degree, and their salaries are the lowest in the Western world.","An old friend of mine, an economist by trade, once explained to me that the statistical definition of 'dilemma' is 49.9% in favor and 50.1% against. If the gap is greater, there is no dilemma, because the answer is clear.","Politicians around the world are very different, but they all have one thing in common: The first thing they respond to is public opinion.","I'm not particularly fond of Shoah jokes, yet there is one I cannot forget: Why was Auschwitz an optimistic place? Because all the pessimists were already in New York by then.","Why doesn't anyone remember that the Palestinians already had four real opportunities to establish their state, yet each time they preferred to revert to terrorism?","Does the global Left - as well as the Israeli Left - truly not care about the horrific Taliban regime, the terrible oppression of women in Gulf states, and the mass hanging festivals in Iran?","Yeshivas barely teach any Bible, only Talmud.","I studied math, and I was terrible at it.","Twenty percent of students in Israel's schools are haredim; another 20% are retired; another 20% are Arab. I have no problem with any of them.","You want private education for your students? No problem whatsoever; pay for it.","I'm going into politics because I think that the kind of discourse taking place in Israel is leading this country to oblivion, and I want to change it.","As opposed to journalists, politicians cannot make do with questions. They must also offer answers.","I think that haredi children should study the core subjects and that their parents must work, and I believe that there are many haredim who think like me and would be glad to discover that someone is fighting the radical functionaries and rabbis who embitter their lives.","For years, Judaism has been a sort of product put on the religious shelf, and on holidays, we would take it off the shelf and let seculars play with it for a bit. Now, Judaism is going back to being something that more closely touches everyone.","My children receive education that greatly emphasizes the fact they are part of a human group that has tradition, collective memory, and a state. I am a great believer in the need for Israel to be a Jewish state. I certainly believe my children will pass that on to their children.","Israel's middle class is paying for those below it, and that's fine, but also for those who are above it, and that's very wrong.","The Internet, Facebook, synagogue pamphlets, and the plethora of TV channels and cellular networks in our lives increasingly blur the boundary between the public and private sphere.","The liberals will surely argue that every person has the right to fall in love with no regard to religion, creed or gender, but I am not that liberal.","The rabbis and their wives may say whatever they wish in private conversations. I may not like their views, but a person is allowed to say anything in his or her own home.","Gregory Lee Johnson was an idiot.","The State of Israel was not established by anxiety but, rather, through pride.","If someone doubts our right to exist - be it on the hills of Umm al-Fahem or in Munich's beer halls, in Gaza's crowded streets or in the thick woods of Babi Yar - it's their problem. Proud states do not break into wails and crawl under the carpet when they discover someone doesn't love them.","Jewish existence in the Land of Israel depends only on the Jews, and on what the Jews think of themselves.","In politics, there is only one crime that is unforgivable - showing weakness.","Children believe that if they just want something badly enough, it will happen.","Quite a few people feel uncomfortable when faced with the claim that the Jews are the world's smartest people. In our politically correct era, one is not expected to argue that one group within humanity has an advantage over all the others.","Decisions are never easy. If they were easy, they wouldn't be called decisions.","Facts cannot be replaced by opinion.","The settlers, as we know, are the only people in Israel who take the Left seriously. When you read the settlers' publications, you think that the leftists are everywhere: The leftists infiltrate the government, the leftists run the Defense Ministry, the leftists dominate the legal establishment, and the leftists control the media, of course.","The settlers do not have a problem with the leftists but, rather, with Israelis who like settlers: Israelis who are unconcerned by the fact that national-religious youngsters are overtaking our elite units. Such Israelis actually appreciate the settlers for that.","Intellectuals know how to answer the question, 'What God do I believe in?' not only through the question of 'What God do I abhor?' Intellectuals can also answer the question of 'What flag do I wave?' without having to answer the question of 'What flag do I burn.'","Intellectuals are people who manage the world in their head. They look at life and try to see some kind of truth, and if they cannot find it, they attempt to create it.","If, for 2,000 years, you dress up differently, believe in a different God, celebrate different holidays, and on top of it insist on telling everyone that you're completely different than them, ultimately they'll believe you.","The democratic system is premised on trust in the masses' wisdom. We believe that the collective is wiser than its parts and that, at the end of the day, it shall make the right choices and take the right decisions.","Freedom of expression is tested during times of anger and conflict and enables all opinions and outraged expressions of dissent that we may not want to hear. But even for this there have to be limits.","Even in an enlightened democracy, the media have to check themselves to make sure they are not contributing to an unnecessary mass hysteria.","Journalists always explain that people are mad at them because they tell the truth, which is often unpleasant or uncomfortable to hear. However, they fail in situations where there is more than one truth.","The Israeli media are very important to me. I've been part of them and they a part of me all my adult life.","There is a clear interest within ISIS to drag Israel into a war with them. If they do so, they will be able to paint Israel as having an alliance with the states fighting against them.","One of the greatest fears of the Arab world is a direct conflict between Israel and the Islamic State.","Instead of personal security, citizens are afraid to walk down the street in Jerusalem.","Netanyahu needs to stand before the Israeli public and say, 'I failed.'","The Israeli public's willingness to enlist, the warm embrace for the soldiers and the residents of the south, and the desire to contribute and to give at any given moment really warm the heart, and it gives all of us strength.","If you want to do stuff, you have to be able to handle controversy.","Politics - when it's not cynical, it can be a creation.","Israel was founded as a refuge for the Jewish people, but today it isn't a safe place. It is safer to be Jew in New York.","I want to live in a country that is not just a place but also an idea, and Jerusalem is the heart of the idea. There may be practical considerations, but a country cannot exist without an ethos, and Jerusalem is an ethos.","I like Tel Aviv; I live in Tel Aviv, but our right of return is Jerusalem. We did not return after 2,000 years for Tel Aviv but for Jerusalem.","I don't feel we need a declaration from the Palestinians that they recognize Israel as a Jewish state.","People in Israel are sick and tired of the old politics.","One of the hardest things is to create hope.","Israel can't be the only country in the Western world not to have freedom of religion.","I'm willing to take a polygraph test to prove that I'm happy about Kahlon's return to politics. He's a good man, a man who cares. It's good to have people like that in politics, I have no problem with that.","The Golan Heights is an area in the north of the State of Israel that has no part in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.","I want to do everything in my power to ensure the equality between all movements of Judaism in the state of Israel: Orthodox, Conservative, or Reform. In conversions, in budgets, in the eyes of the law. No one can claim ownership over the Jewish God.","The Palestinians must be brought to an understanding that Jerusalem will always remain under Israeli sovereignty and that there is no point for them in opening negotiations about Jerusalem.","The Tower of David is important for Israel's heritage and existence because it is more than a tower, it is a symbol. It is more important than the Azrieli Towers.","I feel we're at risk that a whole generation of young Israelis, who went to the army, work hard, pay taxes, one day will look around and say, 'Hey, this country is going nowhere.'","Social revolutions are never simple.","Succeeding in life is a difficult business - you need to work 16 hours a day, face failures along the way, remember that nobody owes you a thing, and take risks.","People like to invent enemies. It spares us the need to address complex worldviews.","The views of religious-Zionist rabbis are of course worthy of being heard, yet they represent a very defined and very narrow camp within the Israeli spectrum. This is not the way to shape the perception of future division and brigade commanders.","I am a Zionist.","Hebrew is the language I use to thank the Creator and, also, to swear on the road.","The State of Israel was not established so that the anti-Semites will disappear but, rather, so we can tell them to get lost.","I am a man of tomorrow, but I also live my past.","I urge the senior members of the political system to form as broad a government as possible that would unite the moderate forces from the Left and Right so that we will be able to bring about real change in the State of Israel.","Israeli citizens deserve full-time ministers.","Israel's master strategy needs to be moving toward a regional arrangement that will enable a full normalization of relations with the Arab states and the establishment of a demilitarized Palestinian state alongside the State of Israel.","There's always a reason not to do anything... to flee the need to make decisions.","When someone doesn't react to changes, the changes turn against him.","I don't reject caution, but you also have to be careful about caution because there's a stage when it turns into paralysis.","The Left doesn't understand the importance of God in the Israeli public discourse, and Yesh Atid does.","Yesh Atid is a Jewish, religious-secular party. Our DNA is center - both Left and Right. The difference between center-left and center-right is more emotional and hereditary than having to do with what people think about the Palestinians.","Judaism is a whole line of values that have existed for thousands of years, but the democratic idea is a new idea, and significant parts of it stand in contradiction to Judaism.","How can Israel say that everyone is equal before the law - that you're equal before the law - when the law defines Judaism as the cultural, national and legislative basis for the state?","I used to have so many opinions before I learned the facts.","If you want to change a country, you're going to be bumped every now and then.","Jerusalem will remain under Israeli sovereignty and will not be divided.","The Human Rights Organisation deceives the world by calling itself a human rights council.","Every Jew is my brother, and I will not succumb to hate speech."],"Yakov Smirnoff":["If love is the treasure, laughter is the key.","In Russia we only had two TV channels. Channel One was propaganda. Channel Two consisted of a KGB officer telling you: Turn back at once to Channel One.","I fed my ego, but not my soul.","I like American women. They do things sexually Russian girls never dream of doing - like showering.","Everybody laughs the same in every language because laughter is a universal connection.","Falling in love is a chemical reaction. But it wears off in a year. That's why you need a strong line of communication... which includes laughter.","Homosexuality in Russia is a crime and the punishment is seven years in prison, locked up with the other men. There is a three year waiting list.","Laughter is the shortest distance between two people.","The reason gas prices are so high is because the oil is in Texas and Oklahoma and all the dipsticks are in Washington.","When you like something, you find time to do it.","It's kind of bittersweet. The human spirit is not measured by the size of the act, but by the size of the heart.","We may have forgotten how to feel. Nobody is teaching us how to live happily ever after, as we've heard in fairy tales.","I have American in-laws, and I care about the environment. We don't use disposable diapers, which, of course, creates an environmental problem of our own.","I believe that laughter is a language of God and that we can all live happily ever laughter.","I believe that love and laughter can only happen when one person takes the time to think about what would cause the other person to feel good.","We have been learning since we were children how to make money, buy things, build things. The whole education system is set up to teach us how to think, not to feel.","Balance is so important in our lives. In our busy world, we can give ourselves balance between thinking and feeling.","To my real estate agent, Chernobyl is a fixer-upper.","I came to America to make it my home, and I did.","After the Soviet Union collapsed, people thought I wasn't funny anymore.","My father described this tall lady who stands in the middle of the New York harbor, holding high a torch to welcome people seeking freedom in America. I instantly fell in love.","I believe there is a direct correlation between love and laughter.","In today's society we sometimes forget to balance our hearts and our heads; this is the reason we stop laughing.","When the needs of one person are being met by the other, there is laughter.","We have a choice - we can both think and feel, using our heads and our hearts.","Never having alone time is real tough on people.","The ad in the paper said 'Big Sale. Last Week.' Why advertise? I already missed it. They're just rubbing it in.","As Americans after 9/11, we're much more united, together as a nation, and we got stronger, better, and more at peace. By peace, I mean the harmony you can feel in our united determination to fight these terrorists and killers.","Americans think Soviets are so grim. I want them to see that they can smile.","Men and women are immigrants in each other's worlds.","If you have something important to say, Broadway and New York are great places to say it.","Comedians are always hitting the topical notes that are on everybody's minds.","Falling in love is a chemical reaction. But it wears off in a year.","People in Tulsa are totally friendly; the crowds are very nice.","There's depth in my comedy.","I was this non-threatening funny guy who contrasted the image of the Brezhnevs and the Reagans of the world.","I was not only typecast as a Russian, but I was typecast as Yakov Smirnoff. This is understandable, and I was very happy to get the roles, but it would be nice to be in a movie where I could be someone else."],"Yamamoto Tsunetomo":["One's appearance bespeaks dignity corresponding to the depth of his character. One's concentrated effort, serene attitude, taciturn air, courteous disposition, thoroughly polite bearing, gritted teeth with a piercing look - each of these reveals dignity. Such outward appearance, in short, comes from constant attentiveness and seriousness.","Nothing is impossible in this world. Firm determination, it is said, can move heaven and earth. Things appear far beyond one's power, because one cannot set his heart on any arduous project due to want of strong will.","When confronted with two alternatives, life and death, one is to choose death without hesitation.","There is surely nothing other than the single purpose of the present moment. A man's whole life is a succession of moment after moment. If one fully understands the present moment, there will be nothing else to do, and nothing else to pursue. Live being true to the single purpose of the moment.","One must know the so-called 'lesson of a downpour.' A man, caught in a sudden rain en route, dashes along the road not to get wet or drenched. Once one takes it for granted that in rain he naturally gets wet, he can be in a tranquil frame of mind even when soaked to the skin. This lesson applies to everything.","All of us want to live, and that is absolutely natural. However, we should learn from childhood on to choose our best way to die. If we don't do that, we end up spending our days like a dog, only in search of harbour, food and expressing a blind loyalty to his owner in return. That isn't enough to make our lives have a meaning.","Human life is truly a short affair. It is better to live doing the things that you like.","When meeting difficult situations, one should dash forward bravely and with joy.","Meditation on inevitable death should be performed daily. Every day one should meditate on being carried away by surging waves, falling from thousand-foot cliffs, dying of disease.","Every day without fail one should consider himself as dead. There is a saying of the elders that goes, 'Step from under the eaves and you're a dead man. Leave the gate and the enemy is waiting.' This is not a matter of being careful. It is to consider oneself as dead beforehand.","Whether people be of high or low birth, rich or poor, old or young, enlightened or confused, they are all alike in that they will one day die.","Death seems to be a long way off. Is this not shallow thinking? It is worthless and is only a joke within a dream. It will not do to think in such a way and be negligent. Insofar as death is always at one's door, one should make sufficient effort and act quickly."],"Yami Gautam":["Fashion is anything which is you and reflects your personality, and if you are comfortable with what you wearing, you'll look trendy and fashionable for sure.","My career is a journey for me, and any journey is incomplete without the struggle.","When I look back at my past mistakes, I realise that there were times when I wasn't myself, and that's why certain styles did not work well for me.","I feel, even if someone is blessed with good hair, one needs to follow the basic hair care regime, and that means investing in the correct shampoo, conditioner, and mask.","I try and groom myself, be it through fitness or dance.","My mantra is simple: work gets you work, and good work gets you good work.","It's not just about achieving success; the journey is equally important for me.","I think you need to love giving compliments as much as you love receiving them.","There has to be that zeal to do something new and surprise yourself and audiences. You have to stay true to your craft, and that should never be sidelined.","I generally like to wear my hair down, preferably with soft curls. But when I'm having a bad hair day, I like to wear my hair in French braids or fishtail braids.","I did a whole lot of work before taking up my first movie. From TV commercials to Telugu films, I learnt a lot from them all.","Hindi films are so deceptive. I thought Mumbai was this big, grand, beautiful city with sea-facing flats.","'Sanam Re' is an amalgamation of an emotional love story and a visual treat.","Whatever I have done so far has led me to 'Kaabil.' It is a big opportunity for me to establish myself more commercially. It is a huge platform.","My grandfather started a school for the underprivileged in Chandigarh, and that is why we moved from Himachal to Chandigarh. It was a small school, where even I would teach while in school.","I was very quiet at college and had a certain group of friends.","I make my own face exfoliant at home, using finely ground rice powder mixed with milk or yogurt. I also treat my skin to a honey, rose water, glycerine and lemon face pack. The honey moisturises, and the lemon removes impurities.","I have never anticipated success. I choose work, give it my best shot, and leave it.","You have to be very strong and headstrong to make your place. You have to know how to say no. Patience is very important.","I take full pride in the fact that I'm from Chandigarh.","When I get to work with someone like Prabhu Dheva at the beginning on my career, why would I say no?","I'm the only one responsible for the choices I make and the opportunities I get. When you read the script, you don't know how it's going to shape up. You just know what you've been narrated.","I'm not a gadget freak.","I'm there on all the social networking sites, as it plays an important role.","We travel a lot and don't get enough time to spend with our family, and so we have to take our pictures, videos, also bother about things like which are the HD quality phones. So I'm very much a part of these typical things.","For fitness, I've just bought a watch which keeps a track of how many calories I burn, what's my heart rate, which is very fascinating.","Even though 'Vicky Donor' was a huge success, I have had one or two films which have not done well, but that's all right.","There is failure in every industry; there is failure in every step. It's just that we are working in an industry where everything is just out there; that is why it looks so magnified. But failure is a part of life.","India-Pakistan war and romance have always been sensitive issues for film-makers in both the countries.","Consciously picking the right script after a long period of wait helped me grab a perfect film in the rom-com genre.","'Vicky Donor' proved that the audience was waiting for well-scripted funny films.","I intend not to do an item song ever. I find the term 'item songs' bizarre. I do not want to comment on its presence and its popularity, but I would rather avoid it.","I love the way Tyra Banks dresses up - she looks so elegant and glamorous in whatever she wears. The confidence and attitude she exudes on and off the ramp is remarkable.","One should know their body types well to experiment with trends.","I love feminine soft shades for summers - I like pastels and bright hues, too. I like summer dresses and tank tops; I think they never go out of style. As much as I'm happy with Western wear for red carpet and social dos, I also like Indian ethnic wear for special occasions.","As an actor, I don't want to do something which I have already done before.","I do not want to do a role which is similar to the previous one or the concept and the genre.","You can never predict a hit or a flop, but it's about what you are happy doing as an actor. Every actor comes with his or her own mindset.","When I go out and I see the genuine appreciation from the people, that's a big thing for me.","You can't tag me as a regional actress.","I started my career with television, and whatever work I did was keeping the content as my topmost priority. Same goes with the movies: I never grabbed any work!","There were a lot of offers before 'Vicky Donor,' but I wanted to wait for the right opportunity.","Learning is always great!","It's a great opportunity when one gets something new to grasp, and I feel we should just grab it.","I use egg whites and an olive oil-based hair mask that deep-conditions the hair and adds incredible shine.","I believe in nourishment and having a balanced diet. I avoid bingeing and try and eat healthy, especially lots of amla, and drink lots and lots of water.","There have been failures in the past, and I know there will be in future as well. But I have learnt from them.","I'm a believer in home-made recipes and concoctions, so I stick to natural or herbal products as much as I can. I also meditate regularly to de-stress.","No matter how long my day has been, I never forget to remove my make-up and slap on some intensive moisturiser before I go to bed.","My hair is naturally straight, and I maintain its texture. My weekly indulgence is an egg-white and olive oil hair mask that deep-conditions and adds incredible shine.","I was born in Bilaspur in Himachal Pradesh, as my parents are both pandits from there. But I was brought up in Chandigarh.","It's a coincidence that most of the films I have done are to do with social causes.","South India has beautiful villages.","I don't look forward to anything. I take things as they come.","I have always been a fan of Kajol Ma'am. The way she portrayed Zooni's character in 'Fanaa' is etched in my memory. I have watched the film several times, and each time I have learnt something new from her performance.","It is very difficult to work in another language, and it is also very challenging.","You need a director, a script, and a role to justify a risk.","There may be 10 odd things which I want to do as an actor, and we get an opportunity also, but I need to be sure whether the person I am trusting or the role that I am relying on - is it the correct one?","In all these years, I've understood one thing: that it's only your work that should do all the talking.","I feel nothing can push you till the time you want to get pushed.","Understanding the importance of evolving is very important. Reinventing is very important. To break what you have already done is very important. That growth should never stop.","We all should face some failures in life and learn from them. We should accept it and move on.","It's a pure dream team to work with Hrithik, Sanjay sir and Rakesh sir.","It's an amazing experience to work with Hrithik. He is one of the finest actors, and there is a reason for it. He is extremely hardworking and fully dedicated.","The reason behind Hrithik being the best dancer is that he never takes his work for granted.","Every actor wants to do a love story, and courtesy T-Series, I got to do two back-to-back.","Junooniyat for love but not necessarily from the romantic perspective. For me, that is for family, that is for my work. For me, both these things are very important, so there is junoon for people I love, which is my family, and my work, which I worship.","I have always done work to which my heart says yes.","If a film is a huge hit, you do think properly before choosing your next projects.","I am not from a film family or a Mumbai girl. The probability of getting a second chance is low, and so one has to be more careful.","I have done work that has appealed my heart, and 'Total Siyappa' is something I really liked.","When I came to know that I have to do a dance sequence with him, I was nervous. After all, he is Hrithik Roshan.","To do a romantic scene is the most unromantic thing to do on screen.","I think a good rapport is required between actors for any film.","I used to hate stilettos. It took me a lot of time to understand how to walk in them and look graceful. And eventually, you realise their importance.","Shoes are important to me because I don't do much with my clothes.","You will always see big, chunky bags around me. I have always been fond of bags. Bags are extremely essential because I keep my books in them.","I love crop tops and love the way Taylor Swift teams them. Her style is relaxed; I can relate to it.","I am following a particular diet, and it requires me to not just eat right but also at the right time. So, I carry food from home.","We all love to be admired and given compliments, but I don't really keep track.","I think Kareena Kapoor is gorgeous. She is effortless. I have never seen her go overboard with her make-up or the way she dresses. Even off-screen or when travelling, she looks gorgeous.","I would love to go to Ladakh - there are beautiful monasteries there and because I am from Himachal. I would love to go to Paris. I haven't been to New York, which I have heard a lot about. And, I would love to go to Kanyakumari. I think that would be interesting!","As a child, I always wanted to be an actor. But as I grew older, the acting dream kind of faded away, and I took to studying a lot. A few years later, a relative of mine who really wanted me to try my hand at acting sent my photographs to a few production houses, and like they say, the rest is history.","On the sets, Ali Zafar was extremely entertaining... he would just start singing out of the blue. It was just great!","Like every actress, I, too, had movies that got stuck, but I have learnt to always look at the best in every situation and to give my best to every situation.","I will just generalise it that anything that I find too disgusting is not worth an answer.","Most of the time, we keep looking outside and feeling sad about what others have. Those are mere excuses.","I would rather wait and keep working on myself harder and wait for the right opportunity. It is not quantity but quality I should be remembered for.","I had some great experiences, but there were times when films didn't do well right, especially after 'Vicky Donor.'","It's difficult when your family are not physically around you.","Yes, I do come with certain reservations, and I'm not OK with certain things, but rather than focusing on what I don't want to do, I focus on what I do want to do, and I bring that energy, and that happens.","I am happy with the response I am receiving for 'Kaabil.' Audiences' love is what we work for, after all.","I have to live up to the love I am receiving.","I can't run my career based on someone else's ideology.","I have always believed in quality work.","Delhi is full of energy. It is special to me because I have shot my first film here, and it is closer to my home town Chandigarh. I love the food, the vibe, and the people here.","The challenge starts when you first come to Mumbai. But it's momentary if you win an award.","I'd love to be able to dance like Madhuri Dixit.","I do hot yoga and TRX, a kind of suspension training."],"Yana Kudryavtseva":["When you're on the victory podium, you're a queen, but when you come down from it, you're nobody. You cannot be too proud of yourself.","For a gymnast to be successful, she needs to strike a balance of everything within herself. She needs to be graceful, flexible, perform all elements, turns, maintain co-ordination - she has to have all of that. If, for example, she only has co-ordination and nothing else, she will not succeed.","I got into rhythmic gymnastics when I was four years old.","Some of the authorities would like to remove rhythmic gymnastics from the list of Olympic sports and turn it into art. I think this would be wrong, as rhythmic gymnastics is a true sport - we train around six hours per day and sometimes spend entire days in the gym.","I would like to get a good education, get married, and have kids."],"Yance Ford":["White communities - and I exempt poor white communities from this - have power over their representation. White people have the ability to define themselves, to exert their agency in a way that they get to be believed. No one believes black people. No one. Until a white person vouches for them.","When I was young, I didn't see anyone who was trans like me anywhere in the movies.","Being nominated is such a tremendous honor. An Oscar win for me and for the 'Strong Island' team would be the cap to an incredible journey. But it would also mean that my brother will not disappear from history.","The quality of festival Q&As is often a matter of chance. Sometimes the lights come up on movies I loved, and not a single meaningful question is asked. Sometimes it's the opposite.","I will never understand how so many young women can go out in the freezing cold wearing so little clothing.","I love marching bands.","Film festivals are usually unpleasant experiences on some level. The lines are ridiculous, the crowds are ridiculous, or the schedules are impossibly arranged: 'You say that there's a film you really want to see? Try the 8 A.M. show! Oh, it's too bad you didn't get to bed until 2 A.M. the night before.'","There is nothing quite as exciting as watching a master at work.","It would have been tough for anyone to adapt 'Push' - an amazing but wrenching novel by Sapphire - for the screen, and I think director Lee Daniels made interesting choices, particularly with Precious' fantasies. In my view, some of them work and some do not, but they are definitely provocative directorial choices.","When I use the word 'buzz' in successive sentences, it's clearly time for me to stop writing.","What little return documentary filmmakers get often comes in the form of recognition by their peers and the critics who influence doc audiences around the country.","'Trumbo' is conventional in its structure, mixing interviews with archival footage. What I enjoyed most about the film was its liberal use of his own personal letters to friends and family, performed dramatically by well-known actors.","If my making history makes it easier for a trans kid at home somewhere to feel more at home in their skin, then I'm so excited about that.","If I can help one family embrace their child and not displace them and throw them out, I'm happy about that.","Most black families went from the South to the city. My family went from the South to the city to the suburbs because they wanted their children to have the realization of the suburban lifestyle. What does it mean that that doesn't actually protect you?","I remind audiences that I'm in the fortunate position to make a film about my family.","White people get to do that all of the time. They get to engage in bad behavior, even felonious behavior, but they rarely wind up in jail. But as a black person, losing your temper can cost you your life. Or insisting on your rights can cost you your life.","What 'Strong Island' does is bring a historical perspective and help people understand that what we're treating as a modern-day phenomenon is actually not modern. It's actually quite old.","Violence against the other, and the way we otherize people out of fear, has to be examined across the board.","My father just believed in my mother's ability to do anything.","Our blackness and how to survive being black in America was something that our parents instilled in us extraordinarily well.","'Strong Island' has been a labor of love and dedication on the part of so many people, that it's just an incredible recognition to be honored. And to be the first trans director - and, I believe, the first African-American trans director - to be nominated for an Academy Award is incredibly, incredibly special to me.","'Strong Island' is slang for Long Island, New York. And it really grew out of - what may surprise people, it really grew out of the very vibrant hip-hop scene that, you know, is located and still generates artists out of Long Island.","The justice system isn't meant to work for people of color in this country.","Black lives are too easy to take in America because we don't want to question why people are so afraid of black and brown people to begin with. And that's what I want 'Strong Island' to do.","I had a list of 10 rules when we started 'Strong Island,' and one of them was, 'Yance will never appear on camera with sync sound.'","It would be easier for people to grasp that gender, sex, and sexual orientation are different things if we had as much imagination in real life as we do when we are making our movies.","I would hate for people to think that 'Strong Island' is just about a family's grief. It is about a family's grief, yes, but it is also an interrogation of our criminal justice system.","It's important that people understand that 'Strong Island' is just as much about this claim of reasonable fear and our need to interrogate reasonable fear as it is about my family's grief.","My brother's death picked up my life and put it down somewhere else. I had an image of myself in my mind as a working artist, and when he died, all of that changed.","Everyone in the street where I grew up was given the same message: You can be anything; you can do anything. That wasn't extraordinary; that was ordinary for us. My folks didn't believe in black exceptionalism. There's nothing exceptional about 'You can have that, too' - except when it comes to justice. You can't have that.","I think fear has been racialised. When you get someone who says 'I was afraid' of a big black guy, that's enough to say, 'Okay, not guilty,' or, 'No indictment.' It's persisted over generations, and it needs to stop.","People come up and say, 'Thank you' for showing a black family loving their masculine-presenting child and for undoing the myth of black people as being rabidly homophobic.","Grief is a very complicated monster. There's no real exorcising of it. It has a different form every day.","I'm incredibly proud to be the first trans director to be nominated for an Oscar.","My impression is that the Academy is really sincere about moving toward a more inclusive and representative Hollywood.","I don't feel like a hero.","I hope that audiences understand that there is a precariousness to black lives in this country that we need to address, that there has always been a precariousness to black lives in this country that we need to address. In fact, our country is built on the precariousness of black lives, the disposability of black lives.","I worked at 'POV' for five years before I told one person about my brother.","I don't think I present as gender-conforming on screen, but some people need a little extra information.","Instincts are a really important guide for any artist, but particularly filmmakers because it takes a lot to stay true to your instincts as a storyteller.","I have been gender-nonconforming my entire life.","Grief, for me, is a moment-to-moment experience.","I have a lot of surrogate parents, but there's no one like your mother.","When I was making 'Strong Island,' it was very clear to me that my brother's death was a point on a line that stretched back into the 1940s and beyond in my family - and in the nation.","We have to deal with the way that race influences our criminal justice system.","'Strong Island' is not your typical true-crime film. It's not actually about the uncovering of evidence or following leads that hadn't been seen before or any of that stuff.","There are people who get to be three-dimensional humans in the United States, and there are people who do not."],"Yancy Butler":["I'm the oldest 26-year-old I know. A lot of experience has been crammed into a short amount of time. Some days I feel a good 65, 70. Like I want to lie down.","I pretty much make time for that weekly manicure.","People just kind of associate me with kicking some ass.","Yancy is actually a Native-American name, but I'm Irish. Go figure.","Women have been kicking ass for centuries.","Whether it goes to series or stands by itself, I'm proud of what we did with it, not only from the standpoint of what it could have been, but for itself.","To say I'm the easiest person to live with would be a lie.","Once you get into a part, and someone sees you, you get asked to do it again.","My taste in music and entertainment is quite eclectic.","My mother's side of the family was in the production side of theatre. My grandfather, Jose Vega, was a general manager for Neil Simon shows on Broadway.","My junior high was dreadful. I see a lot of my fellow alumni on America's Most Wanted.","My grandfather was a cop in Long Island. I often try to draw on things that I've heard about him.","My father used to sing to me in my mother's womb. I think I can name about any tune in two beats.","Imagine if it happened to you: All of a sudden you find this thing on your wrist and people are telling you it has powers. I would be a little skeptical myself.","I've spent a lot of time and money trying to keep my anger in control.","I've always played strong women who are doing their own thing.","I'm open to sci-fi, but I was never a diehard fan. I have no idea why it keeps following me. I'm extremely lucky, I guess; it's a lucrative venue.","I'm just an actress. They try to give me as little information as possible.","I'll try anything once.","I think sometimes women who are supposed to be strong are also written as mean and vindictive.","I think seeing some of the past can be helpful, especially if you're into crime solving.","I never worked less than 16-hour days on South Beach.","I love old movies. The '40s theatre pace is fantastic.","I hope I don't just sit around moping for two years.","I had to skydive for the movie and I was terrified. Like everybody, I thought it was going to be one of those experiences that changes your life. It didn't.","I grew up in Greenwich Village. Dad was friends with John Lennon and Yoko Ono.","I don't know that I'd necessarily want to see into the future. I don't want to know what's happening next.","I dig science fiction, though it was never really my thing.","I can be extremely vulnerable. People are tough on me because they think I can handle it.","I am so happy to be on a show with writing I wanted to participate in.","Don't we all just really try to fake it well?","A comic can be aesthetically beautiful. I think they captured it beautifully and accurately."],"Yandel":["Reggeton has changed very much, musically. It has evolved. The artists have also evolved.","I really want my music to go mainstream.","At first, because this genre of music was so urban, sometimes we would sing songs that were so aggressive. And my parents didn't like it. They would break my cassettes and say, 'That music is garbage.'","I had that hunger to work and keep growing. So I started to cut hair. When I started getting better, I got my own barbershop. I had a lot of clients in my hometown, so I wouldn't stop cutting hair. That's why I think I have such discipline in my job because I've always been very responsible.","Wisin is my brother. He always will be my brother. We are very happy as solo artists. We had a great musical trajectory together, which will be there forever. And for the future, we won't discard reuniting and making something new.","My kids are very special; they can bring a lot of surprise.","I enjoy being in New York. I have so many fans here that sing all my songs from start to finish.","'Dangerous' is an album that I was very dedicated to. I wanted every song to be a hit.","The 'Dangerous' album has producers like Tiny, who to me is very special. Also, Luny Tunes, Nesty La Mente Maestra, Nelly La Arma Secreta, Haze, and El Ingeniero. I wanted to use everyone who makes music in Puerto Rico and beyond to have variety.","Roc Nation has an army. I'm happy because this is what I needed. I have the music, but they have the muscle.","Some people don't understand that I - as an artist and a person - I want to make my own decisions and create the music that I personally like.","I can make my own decisions, I can do the music I like. If I fail, it's me failing - you know.","I am really excited and thankful for opportunity to work with Cotto Promotions, Tidal and Roc Nation."],"Yang Lan":["I think nowadays, women are breaking the borders or the boundaries and also trying to give a new interpretation in terms of impact you can have to the society.","On my show 'One on One', I interview leaders from around the world - in politics, business, art. My other show, 'Her Village', is more like 'The View'.","In China, the rules of the market are not always that transparent. So it's very hard. Also, the national TV networks are all owned by the government, so our shows are subject to censorship by the networks. Every now and then, we are told that certain subjects cannot be talked about. There are frustrations.","In 1994, after four years of talking about travel on my first show, I realized I knew so little about the world - I knew so little about myself. I decided to quit my job and pursue a postgraduate degree in New York.","I'm very curious to witness the historic transformation of Chinese women."],"Yani Tseng":["I will keep smiling, be positive and never give up! I will give 100 percent each time I play. These are always my goals and my attitude.","Most recently, I learned another hobby: baking. It's so much fun to mix all the ingredients and to see the cake come out nice. It's so rewarding when the cake comes out great and tastes great.","I have a fearless but neutral personality.","I like to smile. I smile even when I'm nervous since it calms me down and shows my friendliness.","You learn from your mistakes, and I think it's a good thing as long as you learn something.","I always believe that every one of us is working hard not only for our own performance but also to give something significant back to the societies we live in.","We always learn more from the losing than the winning.","I love to show off my ability in a nice way.","I am closer and closer to reaching my childhood dream. This is really exciting! I will continue to work hard, to focus on each tournament I play.","I'm still number one, so don't forget about that. So I still can have a happy ending.","You always learn something from mistakes.","I shall have a beautiful dream tonight. I also wish everyone to have a beautiful dream.","Sitting on the airplane seat today, I was thinking - I have been in different cities every week. Most of the time, it's because of golf tournaments. But occasionally, I also attend various events. All of a sudden, I feel like I am a business woman. Although sometimes I feel tired, I do enjoy this kind of life.","I love various sports, including basketball, tennis and billiards.","At that time, I feel sad, and I feel no one knows how hard I work and how many tears. They only know the score. At that time, I feel very lonely because no one understands since they haven't been world No. 1 before.","I just want to show the fans my big smile and play the game that I love.","Asian players train so hard. Most of the time, on Monday mornings, the only people you see on the range are Asians. I mean, only see Asians.","I feel very peaceful.","I started second-guessing myself and was always questioning myself. I have really learned a lot.","Golf is not easy.","I want to play for my country, play for everybody, and I want to be there. I just feel like I have so many feelings and I want to play in the Olympics and feel how special if I can win that tournament.","You learn something when you don't play well, and I figure that helping people, it makes me very, very happy.","I want to be best golfer in the world. But I feel like golf is not everything in my life, but I want to keep doing it, keep working hard, do the best I can on the tour and give back to the tour.","It's very easy when you have someone in front of you that you can chase. You want to be No. 1 but now I feel like I have to play well because everybody looks at you as a best golfer. So that's why I put more pressure on myself.","I feel like every word I say now, I can really inspire people.","As it becomes longer at No. 1, I feel more and more pressure. Everybody is trying to grab every piece of me.","When you play good, everything is good, but when you don't play so good, everything is bad. Even when you think there are good things, they still say bad things.","I have the picture in my mind of how emotional I will feel if I win again.","It's easy to have a good season but if you want to have a great season you have got to win a major tournament.","So it must be my mental, because sometimes when I start on the tee, I still worry about whether my ball is going to hit right or left.","The very first tournament I watched is the U.S. Open when I was 13. And that was the year Juli Inkster won.","I think to be 'tough' means you look relaxed. So you have to be tough to win tournaments. But you don't want to be so tough on yourself.","I want to improve my bunker, fairway and putting status because that's been my weakness over the last three years. If I can just focus on this, then everything else will come.","You know golf is very lonely. When I'm in the States, I feel like if I just think about Taiwan, my friends, my fans, I won't feel like I'm alone.","I'm just so happy to see my friends and fans in Taiwan, 'cause that's where I'm from.","With Tiger Woods, you know everyone is watching. But I think interest in women's golf is getting better too.","People are trying to grab every part of you, so it's really hard to focus.","You need to take care of your time and practice, you need to rest and talk to media. So it's really important to organize those things.","It's hard to always be on top. You go down, you go up.","When I was 13 my dream was to play the U.S. Open. Now it's to win it.","I'm just going to have fun. Maybe that will be the most important thing to do.","It seems to me every one of us is doing something meaningful for this world.","I hope one day I will host my own charity event to give back to society.","Not only am I constantly seeking better performance but also to be a better person, to be respected.","I am very happy since when I am in different cities I can experience and learn different cultures!","Walking down the red carpet, suddenly I felt very special and different. All the flashlights from cameras and requesting voices from the media, the scene, it was just like what I remembered seeing on TV or a movie when I was a little girl - the scene only when movie stars appeared.","I feel I am very fortunate to have a job that I really like.","I am so honored to be named as one of Time's 100 most influential people.","In golf, it's almost impossible to be perfect on each shot; that's the fun and challenge of golf.","Although I have won many times now, each time when I have a lead, I start to think about winning. It's very difficult not to think about winning. Every time, there are new challenges. Every time, there are new issues to overcome.","I'm very excited every time I'm at Augusta National. It's such a beautiful and fabulous golf course.","I will keep working hard!","My parents both played golf and introduced me to golf when I was 5 years old. They took me to the driving range and I played around at the range and immediately developed an interest in it.","When I was 7, my dad asked his friend to teach me. I played my first tournament competition when I was 8. I remember I shot around 125."],"Yanis Varoufakis":["If the 'Athens Spring' - when the Greek people courageously rejected the catastrophic austerity conditions of the previous bailouts - has one lesson to teach, it is that Greece will recover only when the European Union makes the transition from 'We the states' to 'We the European people.'","Simple logic dictates that if you cannot even conceive the possibility of leaving a negotiation, then it is preferable never to enter one.","Game theorists analyze negotiations as if they were split-a-pie games involving selfish players.","Because I spent many years during my previous life as an academic researching game theory, some commentators rushed to presume that as Greece's new finance minister, I was busily devising bluffs, stratagems and outside options, struggling to improve upon a weak hand. Nothing could be further from the truth.","We Greeks are the blacks of Europe.","The social inefficiency of capitalism is going to clash at some point with the technological innovations capitalism engenders, and it is out of that contradiction that a more efficient way of organising production and distribution and culture will emerge.","I will not contest my parliamentary seat in a sad election that will not produce a Parliament capable of endorsing a realistic reform agenda for Greece.","Berlin has traditionally backed a rules-based eurozone in which every member state is responsible for its own finances, including bank bailouts, with political union limited to a fiscal overlord's possessing veto power over national budgets that violate the rules.","I plan to concentrate on helping set up a Pan-European political movement, inspired by the Athens Spring, that will work toward Europe's democratization.","Even though I resigned as Papandreou's adviser early in 2006 and turned into his government's staunchest critic during his mishandling of the post-2009 Greek implosion, my public interventions in the debate on Greece and Europe have carried no whiff of Marxism.","My first encounter with Marx's writings came very early in life, as a result of the strange times I grew up in, with Greece exiting the nightmare of the neofascist dictatorship of 1967-74.","Every non-Marxist economic theory that treats human and non-human productive inputs as interchangeable assumes that the dehumanisation of human labour is complete. But if it could ever be completed, the result would be the end of capitalism as a system capable of creating and distributing value.","My hope that Thatcher would inadvertently bring about a new political revolution was well and truly bogus. All that sprang out of Thatcherism were extreme financialisation, the triumph of the shopping mall over the corner store, the fetishisation of housing and Tony Blair.","In occupied Iraq, the introduction of new paper money took almost a year, 20 or so Boeing 747s, the mobilisation of the U.S. military's might, three printing firms, and hundreds of trucks.","The euro is a hybrid of a fixed exchange-rate regime, like the 1980s ERM or the 1930s gold standard, and a state currency.","I was told once by a leftwing scholar that as a Marxist, you have to do two things: always be optimistic and always have a view about everything. That advice still sounds good to me.","For some reason, lots of terrible things start here and then spread. The Cold War was one. It didn't start in Berlin - it started in Athens in December 1944; the contagion in the eurozone started here in 2010. We are perfectly capable as Europeans of messing things up unnecessarily.","Bankruptocracy is as much a European predicament as it is an American 'invention.' The difference between the experience of the two continents is that at least Americans did not have to labour under the enormous design faults of the eurozone."],"Yann Arthus-Bertrand":["To have success in your professional life is not so hard. To succeed as a man is more difficult.","No one is an environmentalist by birth. It is only your path, your life, your travels that awaken you.","An image of the Earth, its landscapes, directly affects people. The beauty of the Earth creates enormous emotion, and through that emotion, you can transmit knowledge and raise consciousness.","There is something very utopian about what I do. But utopia is nothing more than a truth that the world is not yet ready to hear.","After Hurricane Katrina, over New Orleans, my helicopter crashed and the pilot and I were only saved because we fell on the roof of a flooded house that absorbed the shock. When the helicopter was spiraling downward out of control, I didn't expect to survive at all.","For me, an aerial picture is no different than a close-up portrait. It's a question of framing and angle. Helicopters are great for that. But I've also used planes. Of course, I always have a harness.","I learned to be a hot-air balloon pilot to take tourists over the Masai Mara Reserve in order to earn some money and finance the work I was doing with my wife, Anne. We were studying the life of a family of lions for more than two years. Taking pictures was a way to capture information we could not put in words.","You know the problem, we don't want to believe what we know.","I never lose an opportunity to speak about my obsession: humankind and the environment.","The Rio Earth Summit in 1992 changed my life completely, turning me into an activist. From the air, you see things you can't see from the ground - you really understand the impact of man, even in a place you know well. My work is meant to convince people we can no longer live like this.","One fifth of human kind depend on fish to live. Today now 70 percent of the fish stock are over-exploited. According to FAO if we don't change our system of fishing the main sea resources will be gone in 2050. We don't want to believe what we know.","For nearly two years, I was flying above the planet with my camera. I knew straight away that this was something important to do, just at this moment, a portrait of the planet for the millennium year. I worked in 80 countries, fighting for money all the time.","The key of 'The Earth from Above,' and of 'Home' is to show the beauty of the planet, and thereby to promote love for it.","Our children think our world will end. It's a tragic thing. Adults don't think that. They don't see that we are eating the planet. But we are. If you take all the biomass of vertebrates on the planet, 98% are men and their domestic animals. All the wild animals in the world make up only 2%.","The whole world is determined by trade - which is really the blood of the world. The driving force is everyone's desire to have a better life. How? By consuming. For countries, the 'Holy Grail' is economic growth.","The fact is that seven per cent of the global population emits 50 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions, and the proportions are the same for the use of energy and raw materials, meat, wood, etc. Simply put, an infinitesimal minority consumes the most and imposes damage on the overwhelming majority, while asking it to change.","The West has become the world model; developing countries are dreaming of living like us, which is impossible. They should reject our model, because it is not sustainable. Developing countries should even give us the example, but unfortunately that's not what happens.","The lions taught me photography. They taught me patience and the sense of beauty, a beauty that penetrates you.","I always take hundreds and hundreds of pictures. I used to work for 'National Geographic,' and they gave us a lot of film.","I'm not an expert when it comes to technology, but what changed things for me was autofocus. I used to have to throw away half my pictures because it was so difficult to get the focus right.","I wanted to be a scientist. I did a thesis on lions. But I realised photography can show things writing can't. Lions were my professor of photography."],"Yann Martel":["In all big cities the style of life is the same. Same endless array of restaurants; same big museums with the usual suspects; same anonymity, which can be thrilling when you're young but which I found got tiresome.","Fanatics do not have faith - they have belief. With faith you let go. You trust. Whereas with belief you cling.","Words are much better at relating emotions and thoughts.","Reality is how we interpret it. Imagination and volition play a part in that interpretation. Which means that all reality is to some extent a fiction.","'Life of Pi' was actually a very simple novel to write.","The moral of a fable is eternal. The moral of a story is temporary to a story.","I find that movies tend to fix the aesthetics of a story in people's minds.","Cinema is visually powerful, it is a complete experience, reaches a different audience. It's something I really like. I like movies.","A movie will do in one second, with one image, what it will take a novelist at least a page to describe.","The language of prose is very different than the language of cinema, so the movie has to successfully translate what was in the book.","A movie is so visually powerful, so overwhelming, that it tends to crowd out how you might have imagined things.","You can't quantify human pain the way you can measure out sugar. Death comes one individual at a time.","I'm not a consumer. I hate buying clothes. I don't have a mobile. I just don't need things. I don't like things.","Books are something social - a writer speaking to a reader - so I think making the reading of a book the center of a social event, the meeting of a book club, is a brilliant idea.","May books spread the world over!","Music moves me - duh - and that is like having a window opening on a heightened reality, but the effect is fleeting: When the music ends, the magic, the uplifting, vanishes and the window slams shut. Words, on the other hand, by the nature of how they work, emotions evoked by dint of carefully laid out thoughts, have a more lingering effect.","My next book - each one while I'm working on it - dances in my mind and thrills me at every turn. If it didn't, why would I write it?","It's true, too, that I'm tired of using books as political bullets and grenades. Books are too precious and wonderful to be used for long in such a fashion.","Cinema is incredibly concise.","Words aren't very good at describing complicated, strange visual things. You can try, and the reader will have some sort of image in their mind, but words aren't good at that.","If I didn't have children, I think my life would be a failure.","I write slowly.","Most of us get our history through story.","Every book I've written has been a different attempt to understand something, and the success or failure of the previous one is irrelevant. I write the book I want.","If a film project were available and the timing was right, I might be interested.","I'm looking at a dead event and trying to give it new life. In a sense, I'm a taxidermist.","The idea of a flip book still really appeals to me. That idea of fiction and non-fiction.","I love Canada. It's a wonderful political act of faith that exists atop a breathtakingly beautiful land.","I'm happy pretty well anywhere on this big, beautiful planet.","I think art comes from some sense of discomfort with the world, some sense of not quite fitting with it.","I can't live for more than four years outside of Canada. I'm Canadian, so ultimately that is my reference point.","How do you live with evil? Art is traditionally - certainly with my secular background - the answer, but art is very self-referential, whereas religion claims to go beyond the bounds of human existence.","I'm still learning my craft.","I am not an autobiographical writer.","I like using animals because they help suspend my reader's disbelief. We have certain ideas about dentists. We don't have many ideas about rhinoceros dentists.","If you write genre fiction, you follow the rules, and you have to follow them because readers expect that.","A great literary work can be completely, completely unpredictable. Which can sometimes make them very hard to read, but it gives them a great originality.","Any writer will be happy and good only if they know what they're doing and why they're doing it."],"Yann Tiersen":["I want less and less control with music. Just playing music without any idea of composition or writing.","I don't compose, actually. I just record. I'm the opposite of a composer in my way of working. I'm more instinctive.","In France the music schools are a bit old fashioned. I was more excited about doing my own stuff or to play with my friend in my band, than studying the piano.","I can't imagine playing a boring gig. Like, a boring audience without reaction, I will play against them.","I started making music with my band in the '80s, so I am more product of post punk than classical music, and I have always carried on this way.","When I'm working in the studio, I like to be on my own because I don't know where I'm going; I want to be completely free to spend lots of time on songs.","Most of the time I like to start an album abroad, not at home, just to avoid the pressure, to not wake up and think, 'OK, it's the first of recording this album.' I like to avoid that.","I love working and writing new songs. But sometimes you need to wait, to have something in your mind, and then you can let yourself play music."],"Yanni":["A simple life is good with me. I don't need a whole lot. For me, a T-shirt, a pair of shorts, barefoot on a beach and I'm happy.","With instrumental music, it is traditionally hard to get exposure.","When you do music concerts at Taj Mahal and the Acropolis, you have to be careful about your performance being appropriate with the place that surrounds you. It has to be appropriate to the culture - it should fit the building behind you, the environment you are playing it in and the culture of that place.","When you hear 'Truth of Touch,' I believe you recognize that it is me; however it's not the typical Yanni album.","There is no gender to my music. There's no male or female voice, no trite lyrics or poetry. It's much more abstract, so it lives with you longer.","While most of the music I write is instrumental, I love to use the human voice as another instrument.","I am so happy that I didn't go to school and I didn't have anyone to tell me how to position my fingers on the piano correctly. And what you do with music and what is the correct way to write it and what is not the correct way to write it.","I dread naming pieces of music because being instrumental, most of the time the songs that I write are instrumental, I want the listener to make up their own story as to what it is and get the emotion pure without using logic.","Not being able to read and write music is not the same as being illiterate in speech and writing.","Truth is the number one element in whatever you do with music.","I don't really like to explain my songs.","I don't like to define my music. To me, music is pure emotion. It's language that can communicate certain emotions and the rhythms cuts across genders, cultures and nationalities. All you need to do is close your eyes and feel those emotions.","If you are a professional, the speed with which you react to a potential problem separates the men from the boys.","When it comes down to music, I have no balance. I am 100 percent. It is like full throttle. Five hundred miles an hour.","My music is based on melody and when I play the piano, it's as if I'm singing with them. When you try to transform that into a vocal, there was very little adjustment.","Music is art, and once you become an artist, you need to learn how to accept criticism.","It has never been necessary for me to learn how to read music.","And going into my studio at night, particularly at night when everybody's asleep, is just a total pleasure for me.","I am so happy that I didn't go to school and I didn't have anyone to tell me how to position my fingers on the piano correctly.","Creativity is an inherent human quality of the highest order. When we create, we become more than the sum of our parts.","Actually, with 'Truth of Touch' I wasn't even intending on making an album. I was just having fun. I had about a six-month period of down time, and I'm not very good at sitting around. So I kind of started going into the studio and having fun with new core mendin sounds.","The good news is when you open up in Vegas, you have a lot of friends, because they all come over to see your opening night.","I just would use any instrument known to man in any combination as long as it describes an emotion.","New Age is a very small box. It was a term that was brought in by the music industry to classify music that is neither jazz, classical, pop or rock. They didn't know what to call it or what to do with it. So they threw it all together under this one name.","You accomplish what you want to accomplish. I just don't ever want to hurt anybody doing it.","I love the road, and I love coming in contact with the fans. They talk to me and that's irreplaceable. But when I get tired, I head to the studio and I am in there for a long time.","I do listen to a lot of music, but I don't listen when I'm writing.","Being an athlete helps me get those grandiose emotions of pleasure and pain that are involved in sports."],"Yannick Noah":["You arrive at a village, and in this calm environment, one starts to hear echo.","I believe in Karma. If the good is sown, the good is collected. When positive things are made, that returns well.","The important thing is staying together if you want to do something special.","When one sings, one does not speak about the problems of the every day. One speaks about the things which inspire us, which helped us.","We have a saying in France. A dog doesn't make a cat.","In the villages in Europe, there are still healers who tell stories.","Downtown, one has less time. But there are in Europe much people who have the faith, in South America, too.","I always traveled. I left Cameroon when I was 11 years old. I lived in the USA, in Switzerland.","I did not support any more New York. I lived 10 years there, and after September 11, I felt very European. I did not share the opinion of people in the street, who were deeply influenced by what they heard in the media.","To take part in this brothel through the payment of my taxes, that had become to me unbearable.","In black Africa, one does not strike, one does not express, one walks right.","Cracked was a very short warrior, whereas Marley was a pacifist warrior.","Arthur Ashe had been the first black athlete to play Johannesburg at the time of apartheid.","At one time, I was persuaded to want to make music, and people answered me that that was not possible.","People judged my work without to have listened to it.","I felt the weight of the past at the beginning of my career of singer.","Being in the stands is very difficult. I was never playing but I am nervous watching, waiting.","It made me hungry. I feel like I'm in a program that really helped me individually as a player. I feel like I'm with a group of guys that are like my best friends.","Your child is happy. What else could you want?"],"Yao Ming":["Endangered species are our friends.","A good leader must be fair.","When I was young, we were taught not to dunk. We were taught not to stand out from the rest of the team. It's different now.","Fortune cookies are a good idea. If the message is positive, it can make your day a little better.","No matter whether you are new or an old team member, you need time to adjust to one another.","If you're going to learn a new language, you can't try to be perfect. You'll stop yourself from talking. You just have to let go.","I finished my high school. I think an educate is very, very important.","Basketball, in America, is like a culture. It is like a foreigner learning a new language. It is difficult to learn foreign languages and it will also be difficult for me to learn the culture for basketball here.","I'm getting fat... because my size, I put on 20 or 30 pounds, it doesn't show very much... I'm thinking about going back to work out in a very short time.","Everybody is improving but I am improving slowly, which seemingly widens our distance.","Putting our ecosystem in great peril is certainly not a part of Chinese culture that I know."],"Yaphet Kotto":["I'm afraid that I'm either going to have to write myself something or direct something if I'm going to get somewhere.","I like doing business in a black city."],"Yara Shahidi":["Never jeopardize who you are for a role. Now, I'm not saying you should never change for a role, because the fun of being different characters is adapting different nuances and different parts of the character, but never jeopardize your moral compass or anything like that to have a role.","I know, ultimately, I want to help effect change; otherwise, I would look at myself in the mirror every day and think, 'What in the world am I doing with my life?'","Maintaining a sense of your personality grounds you in your space. I try and just make what I wear a reflection of how I feel at that moment, at that particular place in time.","If you look at the history of art and fashion, it's always been political. It's always been pushing boundaries.","L.A. is great, but it's a completely different beast. I go back to Minnesota, and I borrow a bike from my neighbor and go around Lake Harriet saying 'Hi' to people. Some of that is missing in L.A.","I have so many pairs of oxfords; it's ridiculous. It started because at my school you have to wear oxfords for our uniform, but after I got my first pair, I realized they were really comfortable, so they became my regular walking shoes, too.","My friends always laugh because I'm the kind of person who bought the Brooks Brothers school skirt, even though it's not my school's uniform skirt, but just because I liked it. I'm a knee-high socks kind of person.","When we moved to L.A., I started going out for more commercials, and then one day they emailed me a movie script. The first thing I said was, 'No way. I love commercials.'","I really love acting, but I also really want to be a historian, so it's really confusing.","One thing I've always been concerned about is the objectification of women in ads, and that's one thing where I was like, 'Well, if I become a part of advertising, I could change that.'","For me, personally, I'm usually not on my phone that much. I prefer listening to old radio shows and watching foreign films than tweeting.","Having life experiences outside of acting is something my family has always made sure happens.","When you're a part of any protected class, whether it is being a woman, a person of color, a part of the LGBTQ community, or an immigrant, we're expected to get everything right and be the embodiment of perfection when it is not expected of other people.","I am all about comfort and whatever comes along with comfort. I wear a lot of sweats. But I'm also very preppy naturally.","The more you learn about someone, how could you not want to protect them and their rights? The more you learn about a culture or a certain identity, it's hard to not feel empathy.","I was in Minnesota, where I was born, and I did print ads and commercials. And that was always cool 'cause when you're little, you can only work two hours a day, and it changes.","Scenes change all the time. Scenes will change while you're shooting them, and you just have to roll with it 'cause that's what makes it funny. It's not being stuck in your character and how you're gonna do something, but to react to other people and to really have a real-life conversation.","I've been shy twice. Once when I saw Matthew Bomer and once when I saw Adam Levine. I couldn't say anything, literally.","I go on and off home-school and regular school, but the kids don't treat me any differently because they've all known me forever.","I really love hip hop. My cousin Nas came out with an album 'Life Is Good,' and I love that album, but I also love Maroon 5.","One thing that used to worry me is the fact that it seemed like Harvard was this big scary thing where I would have to spend all my time studying just to get in. But getting to go to both campuses of Harvard and Oxford and getting to meet some of the professors was absolutely amazing.","At Harvard, I got to meet and have dinner with Jamaica Kincaid. Just to have conversations with professors was absolutely amazing.","I have the support of my parents and my teachers. They made it very possible for me to go to a school that is open and supportive of me being gone at times and pursuing acting. But school always comes first for me.","'First Family' on the CW is about the president and his family living in the White House.","Being homeschooled for half of my life allowed me to choose my own curriculum and find things I really enjoy, and that's kind of inspired me. I've always been intrigued in or interested in the topics I've been covering.","Quite honestly, I'm the kind of person to get my feelings hurt over something somebody said on Twitter.","I've always struggled with Hollywood feeling trivial. Red carpets aren't worth it.","When you are in the public eye as a person of color, you are given very little room to mess up.","I feel comfortable putting my political stances out there without feeling as though I am filling some sort of quota. I don't have a wokeness quota for the day.","Personally, getting into college was a big deal because I realized it's probably one of the only things I've fully planned. The rest of my life has been, for the most part, a nice little happy accident. I'm glad that it happened this way, but it's nonetheless unintentional.","On a personal level, I think dressing is such a form of expression, and when you do events, it's important to feel as though you are authentically yourself.","Fortunately I can say that social media has treated me pretty well. I've been exempt from a lot of the mean comments.","Personally, I love denim... denim pants, a shirt, denim jacket - I'm good.","I've always loved watches. It's been the one thing that I've asked for, whether it was every Christmas or a birthday.","What modeling taught me at a young age was how to say 'no,' which is something girls - we're not always good at saying 'no.' We want to be nice, and then we forget to look out for ourselves.","There have been moments when I was on a modeling job, and it was the most fantastic thing in the world. And there have been moments where I've realized, 'Okay, I'm ten years old, and I've spent the past six hours outside in the rain.' It taught me how to be specific about what kinds of projects I wanted to do and what kind of work I wanted to do.","Gender is a spectrum.","I remember my first actual intense breakout was when I was 13, and I no clue what to do because I hadn't dealt with anything in that large of a scale ever before.","My mama is African American and from Wisconsin. My baba was born in Iran. My parents have stressed the idea of creating your own path, and creating your own identity is part of that. That's why embracing these two cultures is important to me.","When you're biracial, you can feel like you're fully neither, not fully both. But I won't strip away my heritage for anyone's comfort.","I'm louder and bigger with my curls. There's power in that. Also, straight hair is kind of annoying. It gets caught in my collar.","I am just a history nerd.","Fashion is one of those places in which, when you're wearing something that feels like a representation of you, it does create, in a matter of speaking, a space for you to exist. Even if it's just in a two-inch radius of where you are. It's a walking, personalized area in which you can live.","I'm double majoring in social studies - which is sociology, anthropology, economics, and philosophy - and African-American studies.","I like to think I know a lot, but I don't. I'm motivated to learn more."],"Yash Chopra":["Mumbai's infectious. Once you start living in Mumbai, working in Mumbai, I don't think you can live anywhere else.","I don't make romantic films. I make films about human relationships.","When I was in college, my brother, B.R. Chopra, who is everything to me, was a director in Bombay. He taught me filmmaking. What I am today is because of him.","I've been able to make some wonderful films, but sometimes you make films with great passion - great belief - and these films slightly don't work at the box office, and they become your favorite films.","Human beings are very complex creatures. This desire, this greed, this love is very complex.","When I was in college, I had only one ambition that one day I would like to be a director.","I'm not making films just to be bold.","The secret of being a great actor is a love of food."],"Yasmine Al Masri":["I have a baby that is 21 months old, and I watch Disney Junior with him. A lot of those shows are about pirates. Even the T-shirts and pajamas I buy for him have pirate themes like, 'Aye-aye, argh and mate.' But, I definitely grew up watching pirates.","I come from a family of refugees. I'm used to surviving and going with the flow, and what happened to me was just life.","Although I come from a family who are Muslim - my mother is Egyptian, my father is Palestinian - my mother only puts a veil on her head when she has a bad hair day.","To be a veiled Muslim woman on screen is a very scary minefield for me.","I am a contradiction myself. I'm always looking for something that scares me because when I'm not scared, I'm not stimulated.","I am part of this generation with 'Pirates of the Caribbean' and 'Peter Pan.' I think we all grew up in this culture of pirates.","I am especially fascinated with mermaids, and they are always coming out in pirate stories.","In TV, you don't know everything. The writers only give you scripts before you shoot the episodes. They keep you on your nerve.","I never had planned for my life and my career.","I didn't want to be an actress. I wasn't trying to be in film or an art gallery for me.","I think Hollywood makes the mistake of mixing all these identities and cultures, mostly from the Middle East."],"Yasmine Bleeth":["When I'm out with my girlfriends at the bar, and I see some young 18-year old boy, just for fun I say, 'Hi honey. Do you like girls? Do you like girls exclusively? Oh, good.'","Whenever women catfight, men think it's going to turn to sex.","They told me I gave the best milk mustache of anybody.","No one's ever happy with their position in Hollywood. You hear that from people you'd never dream would complain.","Does being a feminist mean that I believe that I'm as good as any man? Yes.","I love a man who can wear my underwear.","Guys usually know immediately that I'm high-maintenance.","This is my ultimate fantasy: watching QVC with a credit card while making love and eating at the same time.","I don't think men like a bad girl. Well, I haven't had a date in a year so I'm obviously doing something wrong. It's not that my standards are too high, I haven't even been asked out in a year.

Do not let the olive branch fall from my hand.","We started the peace process on the basis of land for peace and on the basis of U.N. resolution 242 and 338,1 as well as other international decisions on achieving the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people.","The Palestinians, whose national cause guards the gates of Arab-Israeli peace, look forward like their Arab brethren to that comprehensive, just, and lasting peace based on 'land for peace' and compliance with international legitimacy and resolutions.","Peace for us means the destruction of Israel. We are preparing for an all-out war, a war which will last for generations.","How can I shave in the midst of guerrilla warfare? On battlefields, we have no facilities for shaving, and that was why I first grew my beard.","We totally and absolutely renounce all forms of terrorism.","I assure you, Ladies and Gentlemen, that we shall discover ourselves in peace more than we have with war and confrontation, as I am sure that the Israelis, in turn shall find themselves in peace more than they have found it in war.","Whoever thinks of stopping the uprising before it achieves its goals, I will give him ten bullets in the chest.","In order to obtain the goal of returning to Palestine, all of us sometimes have to grit our teeth.","The Palestinian Rifle is ready and we will aim it if they try to prevent us from praying in Jerusalem.","Though I am not a chief of state, I must work twice as hard as one because I have to both administer a bureaucracy and run a revolution.","Confidence alone does not make peace, but acknowledging rights and confidence do. Failure to recognize these rights creates a sense of injustice; it keeps the embers burning under the ashes.","As long as we have decided to coexist in peace, we must do so on a firm basis that will withstand time and for generations.","Whoever stands by a just cause cannot possibly be called a terrorist.","Our law is a Jordanian law that we inherited, which applies to both the West Bank and Gaza, and sets the death penalty for those who sell land to Israelis.","I call on Russia and the United States of America, the cosponsors of the peace conference, to help the peace process take bigger steps by contributing to the process and helping to overcome all obstacles.","I would like to congratulate my partners in peace - Mr. Yitzhak Rabin, the Prime Minister of Israel, and Mr. Shimon Peres, the Israeli Foreign Minister - on being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.","The Arabs are looking forward to developing their region, which the long years of war had prevented from finding its true place in today's world, in an atmosphere of democracy, pluralism, and prosperity.","It's always convenient for certain people to heap accusations on Israel.","I call on all the countries of the world, especially the donor countries, to speed up their contributions so that the Palestinian people may overcome their economic and social problems and proceed with reconstruction and the rebuilding of infrastructures."],"Yaya DaCosta":["I try to make my mood uplifting and peaceful, then watch the world around me reflect that mood.","Happiness is the bomb cosmetic! When I'm smiling, sometimes I'm giving thanks for all the things I have rather than worrying about the things I don't.","My parents were very active in the Civil Rights Movement. My father was a Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) worker; my mother was a secretary with the Panthers.","We had already planned my wedding when my brother passed away in 2012. When you're grieving, you don't necessarily want to think about something like that, but my brother told me that he wanted me to, so we went ahead and did it.","I feel at home in a lot of places, but I am truly an African-American."],"Yaya Han":["So many of us, we love these things that come from Japan. We play the video games every day, we read the manga, people watch the cartoons, they absolutely love it.","I think 'Heroes of Cosplay' will show a lot of the positive things, like how much effort it takes to make a costume. These people on the show aren't taking shortcuts. As long as that effort gets through to the viewers, we will be inspirational. Then there will be people who watch the show that want to get in and hands-on make outfits.","I discovered cosplay because I was going to an anime convention and did some research, and found out people dressed up as characters. I made a very badly put-together costume because I felt this desire to dress up.","Before I was a cosplayer, I was a fan artist. I would draw my favorite characters and sell the pieces at art auctions. But once I discovered cosplay, it was like, 'I don't have to draw my favorite characters, I can become my favorite characters.'","It can literally change someone's life; it's very positive for young teenagers to get into cosplay if they do it with their friends or with supervision from their parents - it can really foster their social skills.","I roll from my bedroom into my workroom in the morning and craft-craft-craft.","Companies are hiring cosplayers to be promotional spokes models for them. There are cosplayers trying to develop a cult following even though they've only been cosplaying for less than a year or two. It's all about the social media or Facebook likes.","For me, I've such a steady presence throughout the community that I think if anyone can raise up to the challenge of presenting the face of cosplay, it could be me. Not to be vain, but I've had the training to be in this position.","Cosplayers love Disney princesses. We all grew up with them. We identify with one or more princesses.","Hardcore fans have a vision in their head, and if they look at your cosplay of it, you may not fit their vision.","I was always the freaky Asian girl who drew these weird-looking Barbie dolls in class."],"Yaya Toure":["English football is so physical and fast that when you see a space, you have to go into it with all your speed.","I am a midfielder who is mainly involved in the defensive phases, even if I also like to help build moves - I would say that my foremost quality is my generosity.","You must respect people, and you must respect money. My father said to me: 'When you respect money, money will respect you.'","I am very proud to be African. I want to defend African people, and I want to show to the world that African players can be as good as the Europeans and South Americans.","When you spend a lot of money on one player, you want him to prove himself, but the way football works, one day you can be good, the next you can be bad, and the next after that, you can be very bad. I have come to Manchester City to work very hard and to help my friends make Manchester City great.","The mentality with African and European people is different. In Africa, when you come from a difficult life, when it's not so easy to eat, not so easy to survive, you respect money when you start to earn it, and you respect people more. When you respect people, they will respect you, and your life is better for that.","Football brings you lots of lovely things, but then you have to realise that it's actually a job.","When you get the respect of the fans, it's very hard not to be happy.","The fans sing my name around the world. When I meet fans, they ask, 'How are you? All good with your family?'","To be honest, proper recognition has only come from the fans. I don't want to be hard, and I don't want to be negative, but I want to be honest.","I represent my country, but I also represent the continent of Africa when I play in Europe. That's why it's important to try to achieve something big.","I just had a normal African childhood; we played football a lot, but it was always in the street and always without shoes. Boots were very expensive, and when there are seven in your family, and you say you want to buy a pair, your father wants to kill you.","When we play at the World Cup, any African will back any African team. Because we want to hear the different approach to African football. We want to hear that Africans can do well, and Africans do well.","My family were very poor. I am one of nine siblings: two girls and seven boys. Only my brother and I play in Europe, and then three more work in Europe, and another plays in Tunisia. This family is a footballing family, but our lives have not always been good.","I will never forget how I have been treated here by the fans, the club and the owners, and nothing would give me greater pleasure than to finish my career as a Manchester City player."],"Yayoi Kusama":["I think I will be able to, in the end, rise above the clouds and climb the stairs to Heaven, and I will look down on my beautiful life.","With just one polka dot, nothing can be achieved. In the universe, there is the sun, the moon, the earth, and hundreds of millions of stars. All of us live in the unfathomable mystery and infinitude of the universe. Pursuing 'philosophy of the universe' through art under such circumstances has led me to what I call 'stereotypical repetition.'","Polka dots can't stay alone. When we obliterate nature and our bodies with polka dots, we become part of the unity of our environments.","Forget yourself. Become one with eternity. Become part of your environment.","Since my childhood, I have always made works with polka dots. Earth, moon, sun and human beings all represent dots; a single particle among billions.","Polka dots are fabulous.","My art originates from hallucinations only I can see. I translate the hallucinations and obsessional images that plague me into sculptures and paintings.","I have a flood of ideas in my mind. I just follow my vision.","I, Kusama, am the modern Alice in Wonderland.","I believe that eyes are very important motifs. That's something that can discern the peace and love.","More and more, I think about the role of the arts, and as an artist, I think that it's important that I share the love and peace.","I wanted to start a revolution, using art to build the sort of society I myself envisioned.","Suppose I put polka dots all over my body and then cover my background completely with polka dots. The polka dots on my body, merging with those in the background, create an optically strange scene.","My mother was against me being an artist. She just wanted me to marry a rich man.","If there's a cat, I obliterate it by putting polka dot stickers on it. I obliterate a horse by putting polka dot stickers on it. And I obliterated myself by putting the same polka dot stickers on myself.","I have been taking every step toward the future every day through making many paintings and sculptures with my deep emotion hidden in my life.","I have done all the work myself, not assistants. That's why I'm in a wheelchair: I've been doing it physically - it's hard labour - throughout my life.","People ask about art and commercialism. I think that if someone tries to sell their work at a high price, that is the wrong way of doing it.","I would like to try harder to establish my thought and philosophy strongly and to go back to the universe with my love.","While producing art works, illusions appear from time to time due to my mental illness. Every day is a struggle for me.","I hope royalty continues forever. This is the thing that can contribute to peace throughout the world.","I love painting so much that nothing else matters.","Certainly, I devote my energy to both telling my personal life story and seeking self- obliteration. However, I will not destroy myself through art.","In my home country, there was a little shop with old books, but it was really in the countryside. You couldn't find English books. I found this very avant-garde American art book that had information about Georgia O'Keeffe. I was very much impressed by her.","I love Damien Hirst. I respect his work a great deal, and I am happy that the polka dots I started using have become a symbol of love and peace around the world with everybody joining hands to use them in this way.","When I was a child, I used to paint intently. The older I become, and the closer death approaches, the brighter my life gets day by day.","It doesn't matter at all for me that I work in hospital or anywhere with limited space. Every day, I'm creating new works with all my might.","I want to create a thousand paintings, maybe two thousand paintings, as many as I can draw.","Georgia O'Keeffe proposed that I live with her. She was in New Mexico then, and I wanted to be in New York.","I want to become more famous, even more famous.","I will keep painting until I die.","I have been using polka dots since I was a very young child. Only after that, it seems, have they been used throughout the rest of the art world.","Painting bodies with the patterns of Kusama's hallucinations obliterated their individual selves and returned them to the infinite universe.","I never have a plan of what I am going to draw.","When I paint, some things come out, and I don't know. Maybe it's because I have such talent as a painter.","You should create a work that is so valuable it might eventually sell at a high price, but you've got to concentrate on how you create that artwork.","New York is the place that made my and other artists' dreams come true by giving us a chance to realise our ideas and concepts. It was a great place for making a presentation of artistic creation.","Basically, my idea and explorations on fashion have not changed; however, I believe I'm going state-of-the-art on fashion.","I was in the U.S. about 15 years. Especially in New York. And then I came back to Japan.","The country of Britain is wonderful because of its royalty.","The reason I collaborate with Louis Vuitton is that Louis Vuitton is number one in the world, and I am honored to work with them.","I am putting every effort toward creating my works from morning till night on every single day."],"Yeardley Smith":["You can't create a monster, then whine when it stomps on a few buildings.","Everybody sort of questioned why we get married on New Year's Day, and of course, the avid sports fans wouldn't come, because they had to watch the Rose Bowl or whatever that is on that day.","Romance is dead - it was acquired in a hostile takeover by Hallmark and Disney, homogenized, and sold off piece by piece.","A man who envies our family is a man who needs help.","Oh no, the dead have risen and they're voting Republican.","Is your remarkably sexist drivel intentional, or just some horrible mistake?"],"Yehuda Amichai":["My poems are political in the deeper sense of the word. Political means to live in your time, to be a man of your time.","Every intelligent person, whether he's an artist or not - a mathematician, a doctor, a scientist - possesses a poetic way of seeing and describing the world.","I think the end is endless. It's either a big black hole or a big white light or both together. But it's totally meaningless, because even if someone would explain it, I wouldn't understand it.","I was a very religious child - I went to synagogue at least once, sometimes twice, a day. And I remember my religiousness as good - I think religion is good for children, especially educated children, because it allows for imagination, a whole imaginative world apart from the practical world.","The world of religion isn't a logical world; that's why children like it. It's a world of worked-out fantasies, very similar to children's stories or fairy tales.","I've often said that all poetry is political. This is because real poems deal with a human response to reality and politics is part of reality, history in the making. Even if a poet writes about sitting in a glass house drinking tea, it reflects politics.","The reason a poet is a poet is to write poems, not to advertise himself as a poet.","There are two languages: one as things seem to us and the other of knowledge.","I try to stay a civilian, to live as a human, not as a poet."],"Yehuda Berg":["Words are singularly the most powerful force available to humanity. We can choose to use this force constructively with words of encouragement, or destructively using words of despair. Words have energy and power with the ability to help, to heal, to hinder, to hurt, to harm, to humiliate and to humble.","A true community is not just about being geographically close to someone or part of the same social web network. It's about feeling connected and responsible for what happens. Humanity is our ultimate community, and everyone plays a crucial role.","On one hand, we know that everything happens for a reason, and there are no mistakes or coincidences. On the other hand, we learn that we can never give up, knowing that with the right tools and energy, we can reverse any decree or karma. So, which is it? Let the Light decide, or never give up? The answer is: both.","We need to realize that our path to transformation is through our mistakes. We're meant to make mistakes, recognize them, and move on to become unlimited.","Unfortunately, we can never truly know if we're making the right decision. What we do know is that wherever we are, that's where the Light wants us to be. It's the best place for us to be now. And as long as we don't try to control the situation, then we won't end up in the place we shouldn't be.","I do believe that the original sources of all religions should be taught, because with that we will find our similarities, not just our differences. I believe that if Mohammed, Buddha, Jesus, and Moses all got together they would be best of friends because the spiritual basis of all religions is something that builds unity.","I imagine God to be like my father. My father was always the voice of certainty in my life. Certainty in the wisdom, certainty in the path, certainty always in God. For me God is certainty in everything. Certainty that everything is good and everything is God.","With so much evidence of depleting natural resources, toxic waste, climate change, irreparable harm to our food chain and rapidly increasing instances of natural disasters, why do we keep perpetuating the problem? Why do we continue marching at the same alarming beat?","Personal responsibility is not only recognizing the errors of our ways. Personal responsibility lies in our willingness and ability to correct those errors individually and collectively.","Unfortunately, it is human nature for us to only learn and grow from a place of emptiness. It's hard to learn when we are winning and on top of the world.","If falling into desperation worked to make things better, then I would say, 'Let's all jump into despair.' But it doesn't help. The only way to truly find meaning and fulfillment is to look at the disaster, the pain, the difficulty, and know with complete certainty that good can come from this.","Every little action creates an effect: We are all interconnected.","As children, our imaginations are vibrant, and our hearts are open. We believe that the bad guy always loses and that the tooth fairy sneaks into our rooms at night to put money under our pillow. Everything amazes us, and we think anything is possible. We continuously experience life with a sense of newness and unbridled curiosity.","Change is inevitable. Things absolutely cannot stay the same. The type of change we invoke is up to each and every one of us.","The whole point of all of this - why we are here, why the world is here, and why we have the political system and leaders that we do - is to achieve change. This is the purpose of life.","The biggest breakthroughs in consciousness occur when things are difficult; when we have a choice to fall to the worst of ourselves or rise to the best of ourselves.","Our contribution purely depends on our consciousness and our willingness to support those in need, to show vulnerability and accept the support of others, to share without expecting the credit, to give it our all and allow our hard work to decide the outcome, to understand that control can only be achieved with a shared responsibility.","We need to have complete certainty that things will work out, not because we are righteous or wise, but because of the time, the effort, the prayers, and the tools we are using. From the moment we are given awareness about some bigger picture or mission, we have to have complete focus on what to do to get to that place.","If we each take responsibility in shifting our own behavior, we can trigger the type of change that is necessary to achieve sustainability for our race or this planet. We change our planet, our environment, our humanity every day, every year, every decade, and every millennia.","It's enough to make a small shift within and a small action in the world. Collectively these have a huge effect.","If we can soften our hearts, and if we can access the pure and simple aspect of our nature, then we can regain the realization that everything we need is already inside us and anything is attainable.","If we were handling a bomb which could go off at any minute as a result of our actions, we would mind ourselves and be delicate. Our words have the same power, yet we wield them around as though they were powerless and insignificant.","Many can argue that it is our power of intelligence that is the key to the human domination of our planet. I suggest that it is the ability to put our thoughts into words that can be communicated to others.","If you are messing around all day and then scream for certainty, you're not going to get it. If you spend energy and do the work and develop that certainty, you'll get to where you need to be, even if you don't know exactly where that is.","It is not our sexual preferences, the color of our skin, the language we speak, nor the religion we practice that creates friction, hatred and wars amongst in society. It is our words and the words of our leaders that can create that disparity.","We are increasingly open to understanding how we are all connected and that if we sink the ship that we are all on, we all drown. However, we have simultaneously become so focused on our own life experiences that we think we are alone.","If we can remain present and deal with the moment in front of us, no matter what our battle, then if we lose, we'll know that ultimately we weren't supposed to win that battle in the first place.","At any given moment, it's not about where we are supposed to be. It's about what work, which relationship, what decision I take. Every moment counts. Every decision counts. And if we look at our decisions in life as such, we stop battling and start winning.","Darkness is the only path to light. It is not our wonderful gifts that make us closer to God: it's using our garbage to transform ourselves. This is the key that unlocks the door that opens to God.","It's our own small voice within that is our oppressor; it says we are not worthy and not powerful enough. Our limited beliefs are the real foes we need to fight and conquer.","In every relationship, the work is never just in the positive actions we do for each other, but in the follow up.","With every little bit of change we make in our lives, we can maximize that small change simply by asking ourselves: 'What's next? What can I do now? What additional responsibility can I take on?'","The problem with certainty is that sometimes it can sound cold and heartless, although it is the most compassionate and supportive answer.","'Faith' and 'trust' are words that put the power in the hands of an outside force that we are meant to rely on - whether it is God or a person or the universe. Certainty puts the power back in our hands.","If I said it once, I'll say it again: 'We have the power to change everything.'","Kabbalah is all about change. It isn't about being proud of our good qualities: the wisdom is about transforming our darkness into light.","The truth is that we were born to have it all. And part of our handicap as adults is that we no longer understand our potential.","In truth, we are all part of the team of humanity. And as such, we are all obligated to share ourselves, and our talents, for the sake of the team.","No one person is an island.","Our dependence on the pollutants of this Earth have always, and will continue to have, far-reaching consequences to our eco-systems, bio systems, geosystems and our race's natural evolution.","In the not so distant past, we were close enough to our community to physically see how our actions impacted the group overall. Now it's just too easy to look the other way, or turn off the TV or computer and detach ourselves from the others.","God is not separate from anything, or anyone. So it's impossible to prevent God from being visible in our government.","Before we come to a challenging situation, before the universe squeezes us, how much of our effort is geared toward the reason we came to this world? The more focus we have on the front end, the less focus we end up needing on the back end.","The bottom line is: We must be working on arriving at the destination for which we were put on this planet.","To me, spirituality means 'no matter what.' One stays on the path, one commits to love, one does ones work; one follows one's dream; one shares, tries not to judge, no matter what.","I've learnt more physics from Kabbalah than I ever did in school.","Ego is one of the biggest weapons that is used to take us down. It's self-destructive. It's a problem on all levels - even regular people can have big ego problems.","God never answers prayers. It is people who answer their own prayers by knowing how to connect and utilize the divine energy of the Creator and the God-like force in their own souls.","When I grew up, I thought I was Jewish. Now I don't consider myself Jewish. I consider myself a Kabbalist.","You should have certainty in what you do. Anyone who has done anything in this world was hated. If you're not hated, you've done nothing."],"Yehudi Menuhin":["Music creates order out of chaos: for rhythm imposes unanimity upon the divergent, melody imposes continuity upon the disjointed, and harmony imposes compatibility upon the incongruous.","The violinist is that peculiarly human phenomenon distilled to a rare potency - half tiger, half poet.","The violinist must possess the poet's gift of piercing the protective hide which grows on propagandists, stockbrokers and slave traders, to penetrate the deeper truth which lies within.","I can only think of music as something inherent in every human being - a birthright. Music coordinates mind, body and spirit."],"Yelawolf":["My homies in Gadsden aren't as exposed as I am culturally, which is awesome - that's why I love going home. I'm in the kitchen with people who don't know anything but the simple life, what's important to them, and what's dope.","I'm not ashamed of anything that I've done because when I did it, I was passionate about it and I was doing it for a reason.","'Yela' represents hunger, life, light, fire, power. 'Wolf' speaks to my fighting spirit. The soul I put in my music.","This is hip-hop. If you've got something you want to rap about, just rap about it, man.","Shady's great; I love Shady Records.","You can usually tell when people aren't being authentic, but that goes for every artist, not just white artists.","Fans are all I care about - to be honest. If they stop coming to the shows, then I will get worried.","I'm never scared what people are gonna think about music that I make.","I don't go to clubs and throw money and pop bottles. That's not my thing, no disrespect.","I don't sit under the tattoo gun unless I'm sold on it completely and it will define me as a person.","I do so much music that it's like a fog, and I can't even remember all of it.","For real, some of my favorite music is Mexican. It's something about the bassline and the drumming. I can't even speak Spanish, but that's probably why I like it so much.","You don't want to get stuck with a record that you've done with someone that you feel obligated to put out - that's not really dope, just because you made an effort to get together and work.","My fans are like no other. Completely original people.","I think any artist that's going to become anything in this world faces humility: with great humility comes great success.","You have to fall. You have to understand what that feels like. For what I want in my life, and for where I want to go with this music, you gotta be humiliated, man. You gotta understand what that feels like. It just makes you stronger.","Yeah, I have animosity, a chip on my shoulder. But I love, too.","I just picked up a lot of classic-rock, melodic influence from my mom, music that she listened to, like 10,000 Maniacs, Led Zeppelin, REO Speedwagon and Yes.","I equally love both, classic rock and hip-hop. I love all music, really, and I really use classic rock a lot. I'm heavily influenced by that melodically in my music. I can't really separate the two.","Where I'm from is like 'Hustle & Flow' versus '8 Mile.' It's that really grimy, box-Chevy, dope-boy, working-class music.","'Radioactive' is the fall out of my life's inspirations, a testament to my ability to survive it all and to tell the story.","Sometimes I want to party, sometimes I want to fight and sometimes I want to cry.","I can tell you that when you're willing to give your life up to see a dream through, the reward is great.","American music culture is black culture.","I'm always gonna have the darker edgy music; it is always in my pocket because it comes so naturally to me.","Just because a rapper is white, I don't feel the need to attack them.","Race is still real and you got to recognize it.","I just want to make a classic. Classic is the standard. I'm just trying to make music that will last a lifetime.","Hip-hop for me has always been hardcore and edgy.","You learn how to be an individual quick after 15 schools, man. After the first five or six, you realize you're always gonna be the new kid.","People are not really that forgiving when they pay for tickets to come see you and you don't show up.","I'm never in the mood to eat or drink when I get to a show. I'm just too nerved out.","Anyone can relate to struggle, whether you're European or Asian. Anyone can relate to having to get up and go to work and eat.","I'm from the South, and there's a different understanding of how to chop. There's a syllable play. It's a delicate art. Your accent has a lot to do with it. If you're from a certain area, words don't roll of your tongue as slick.","The way I perceive an album to sound and the way I put out mixtapes are two different energies. There's a different focus; there's a different sound.","Triple 6 Mafia and Mystikal in Atlanta was one of my first shows. I remember how sweaty and smashed up everybody was, and it was so punk rock.","I love performing. I love getting out there. It's kind of like why I make music.","I definitely prefer intimate crowds. I mean, those are always the best shows, like, a small venue. Packed to the gills. Hot, sweaty. Those are always the fun shows.","Most of my albums have a concept. They all have some kind of theme, some kind of feeling. I really take pride in that.","My grandmother, grandfather, my mom - we've always been driven by laughter. It's what held us together. Thanksgivings, any kind of family get-together, we usually end up in tears.","Hip-hop is the only music in the world where you can take any instrument and make it hip hop. It's anybody's music. It's what you make of it. That's for anything you do in life."],"Yelena Baturina":["I demand a lot from myself and reflect this attitude upon others: I consider it to be an important quality for a leader. I also think it is impossible to achieve success without persistence.","The attitude of the business community towards investment in Austria and Germany has always been positive, as both the countries have earned their reputation as countries with a consistent economic environment.","As an entrepreneur and mother, I support the need to put women at the center, recognizing their crucial impact on social development and their important role of balancing family and professional responsibilities.","I was among one of the first entrepreneurs to start building their own private enterprise when Perestroika began in Russia and the state initiated its first market-oriented reforms.","In the mid-1990s, when Russia was undergoing a construction boom, I entered the real estate development market.","On the one hand, I am a businesswoman - on the other, a wife and a mother. Like many women, I have had to distribute time and attention between business and family. It is not at all easy to find that balance.","I am interested in classic building development, such as hotels and residential homes, rather than commercial properties.","When you are in an unpleasant environment that makes you feel uncomfortable, one of the key ways to improve that situation is through design. That's why I think it is so important to help develop and showcase young designers, as they are our future.","The Garden of Wonders project encompasses the knowledge that Be Open has accumulated over the years of work on different continents and different spheres.","Design can successfully bind the ancient nomadic cultures with today's global marketplace, ensuring the preservation of traditions and knowledge for further generations. This aspect of research is obviously rich in its business potential as well."],"Yemi Osinbajo":["The most important thing is that we are on the right path, and we will not deviate from it, even in the face of strong temptation to choose temporary gains over long-term benefits.","Nigeria's unity is one for which enough blood has been spilled and many hundreds of thousands of lives have been lost. Many have paid for the unity of this country with their lives, and it will be wrong of us, as men and women of goodwill in this generation, to toy with those sacrifices that have been made.","The most successful of the nations of the world are those who do not fall into the lure of secession but who, through thick and thin, forge unity in diversity.","Economic growth is not sustainable without nation-building and, even of greater importance, state building.","An active and vibrant railway system confers many benefits on the society.","I understand the law of sowing and reaping. It is a spiritual law that has tremendous physical implications. Every time that we delay or frustrate what we can do today, leaving it till tomorrow, we hold back the future. We, too, must reap what we have sown by experiencing delays.","If people are stealing the resources of this nation, if people are taking bribes - if judges or persons in authority, whether they are judges or whoever they may be in government, ministers, whoever, if they are taking bribes - it attacks the fundament of our existence as a society.","Our diversity as a people united is also our potential to transform our large deposits of mineral resources and use same for national development.","Railway network will support efforts to diversify the economy and enhance our export potentials.","If this government is doing the right thing by fighting corruption, the Church should support it.","As you fight corruption, it fights back.","There is no wisdom of man that can change men or change nations; it is the power and wisdom of God that can.","It doesn't matter where one starts from; it doesn't matter at all where you start from. It is how committed you are, how determined you are, and how hardworking you are that will ultimately make the difference.","Hate speech is a specie of terrorism.","Here in Nigeria, what makes the news is conflict between the executive and the legislature.","Our vision is for a country that grows what it eats and produces what it consumes. It is for a country that no longer has to import petroleum products and develop a lucrative petrochemical industry.","The reason we have Christian president and Muslim vice president or Muslim president and Christian vice president is to have balance.","Africa Rising is as much about improving standards of governance as it is about an increasingly confident youths and civil society. It is also about businessmen and women who are stepping beyond national borders and going global.","Many of the ethnic and other parochial tensions that have tended to create insecurity and outright conflict, time and time again, are largely as a result of failure to deliberately undertake nation-building efforts.","We don't have all the time in the world with oil. We have to use oil while it makes sense to do so.","It is in the interest of the government and also the interest of the nation that things are done properly and that there is due process and that we are not unfair.","No economy can tolerate the level of corruption seen in Nigeria without consequences.","We all know that Nigerian jollof rice is the best anywhere. We beat the Ghanaians and Senegalese hands down.","If you are not around when Africa truly gets going, it would be much like the sceptics who stood on the sidelines in the 1990s convinced that China was going nowhere. How wrong they were.","Corruption and illicit financial flows are different. But they really must be twinned. This is because, for practical purposes, it is an eminently more sensible approach to treat most of the sources of illicit financial flows as corrupt activity, within a broader use of the term.","There must be more rigorous enforcement of rules promoting transparency in the international banking and financial systems, especially more stringent KYC rules on customer identity, source of wealth, and even country of origin.","Tracing, freezing, and return of stolen assets has proved in many cases to be exceptionally difficult for most African countries.","We in Nigeria have seen just how difficult it is to get back stolen assets from the international financial system, such as banks that ought not have received those funds in the first place if even the most routine questions were asked.","The carnal nature of man is that he places his tribe above others, but the only basis for the power and unity of the church is that there is no Jew or Gentile.","I am so pleased and happy, and I believe that the Almighty God has a plan for our nation by putting us in strategic positions in politics, business, and everywhere.","The fundamental for the sustainable growth of Nigeria is not in the hydro-carbon industry but in agriculture.","With 10 per cent of Nigeria's total land mass, 80 per cent of which is arable, Niger state symbolises the hope and greatness of Nigeria and has potential to feed the continent.","Nigeria is still grappling with the negative consequences of the use of opacity by senior members of government and their cronies between 1993 and 1998, awarding themselves juicy contracts in the extractive industry.","Any nation that does not emphasize integrity will always fail.","The values of integrity and hard work are necessary for the development of our nation.","You don't have to cheat or steal to be successful in life, but you must be ready to convert your challenges to opportunity.","I want to say that this business of corruption and the fight against corruption is a very serious matter, and sometimes I'm amazed that very little is being said outside of those who are saying so in government. It's an existential matter. I don't know whether it is possible to overemphasize the point, but I think it's a very crucial matter.","The Nigerian economy is a huge one.","If the church says we will not accept you here or that we will expose you if you are stealing the resources of the country or stealing the resources of a private company or other establishment, where you work, then we would not have the type of problem that we have in this country. If only the church does so - just the church.","Many would say the reason why they steal is because they want to have an arsenal for future political exploits. It is a lie. It is greed. In any case, even if you want to do that, you have no right to do it.","If the church says you are not allowed to steal, and we will ostracize you in our midst if you did, if what a man has does not measure up to what he has, if we found that a man has more money than he should have, if a man is earning a salary of a civil servant or a public servant and he has houses everywhere, we have to hold him to account.","It is not possible for one tribe to dominate another based on the way God has structured the country.","In stabilizing the macroeconomic environment, we have focused on aligning fiscal with monetary policy and nudging the central bank toward the objective of more market-determined exchange rates.","If there is one person in Nigeria that believes that petroleum prices should not go up by one naira, it is President Buhari.","Our country has the potential not just to be the giant of Africa but a major economic giant in the world.","The truth is that many, if not most, nations of the world are made up of different peoples - and cultures and beliefs and religions - who find themselves thrown together by circumstance.","Great economies and great nations, prosperity, and abundance of nations and communities are created by men and not spirits.","No matter how much you pray or fast, our country cannot grow without some of us deciding to do the hard work that makes nations work.","It is the resolve of the government that none will be allowed to get away with making speeches that can cause sedition or that can cause violence, especially because when we make these kinds of pronouncement and do things that can cause violence or destruction of lives and property, we are no longer in control.","The quality and quantum of potential investors in Africa is huge.","We in Africa must prepare our economies in that direction that attracts such huge and qualitative investments. It is for us to push, and we must push.","The most important thing for Africa is that whoever wants to invest in our countries should start in manufacturing.","You are not born corrupt. We want to change that mind-set of the people.","Corruption has been tolerated for too long now, and with Buhari, we will, for the first time ever, have a president who will fight corruption. He will act so that people will be deterred from corruption.","We are committed to a continuous engagement with our people to explain government policies, receive advice and criticism.","As we move to diversify our economy, we are particularly aware that we need oil to get out of oil.","It will be wrong of us to approach our grievances by threatening to disobey the laws or by threatening the integrity of our nation.","Africa cannot afford to underestimate the power of technology to fast-track the continent's rise. Emerging technologies have played extraordinary roles in every aspect of the continent's most touted successes."],"Yevgeny Yevtushenko":["Envy is an insult to oneself.","Poetry is like a bird, it ignores all frontiers.","Sorrow happens, hardship happens, the hell with it, who never knew the price of happiness, will not be happy.","A poet's autobiography is his poetry.

Now I am extra-careful about what I say and do because everyone recognises me.","I will try and make peace between North and South Korea.","On Earth, men are seen as superior because of their physical strength, but it means nothing in space, where there is no gravity.","Only in space did I realize how lucky I am to be Korean. Only in Korea could I have gone to space before turning 30 years old.","They gave me 18 experiments to complete in my 10 days in the ISS. That's a lot. Everyone told me I didn't have to complete all of them, that it wasn't expected of me. But I knew everyone was watching me, so I gave up meals and sleep and completed all 18 experiments. It's a very Korean thing to do.","There is something addictive in space that makes you want to go back - like the mountain climbers who want to go back to the Himalayas although their fingers were cut by frostbite.","I cannot believe I became some kind of hero. I'm just a common Korean woman.","I will do my best to support science in Korea and space programs in Korea.","I've decided to study the MBA, as it's crucial to have comprehensive knowledge of business administration and management in running science technology institutes as well as making science-related policies.","California is an easy place to be an Asian woman engineer.","It's not uncommon in South Korea for a building to not have a women's bathroom.","I feel bad that I'm the one always blamed for the failure of the space business - even though there are problems with government policy toward the space business."],"Yiannis Stournaras":["Difficult years lie ahead, patience is required.","The goal of the government is to guarantee the place of Greece in the eurozone against those who want to undermine it.","Our problem is not adopting reforms, which we will do without question.

Fabric and garment washing are a big part of my design process for that reason. Everything needs to feel lived-in and comfortable.","It's just my aesthetic: to want to feel a bit undone, effortless but not without style.","I started out making personal pieces, and realized that I actually like designing.

Another thing I would say is that a female is more compromising. A female can talk with anyone easily.","Right now the problem in Thailand is we have high debt, but we don't know how to earn the new source of revenue back to Thailand.

I can see why some CEOs crack under the pressure.","I'm not looking to step in and make 'big, bold changes' - I think reddit is great, and the team has a lot of good features already in the pipeline to improve functionality for users and mods, help with subreddit discovery, improve the API, and help bring reddit to more people.","I think that building any product that has a lot of user loyalty is a bit like making a sequel to a great movie or video game - people generally want 'more of the same thing, except better and different.'","Reddit strives to be a community-oriented link-sharing and news site, which means that all our content is submitted and voted on by members of our community. We don't interfere with that process at all, either in an editorial or curation capacity.","In the context of social media, reddit is more about the media than the personalities.","I think that's one of the most unique and potentially powerful things about reddit - people come for the news, and stay for the community.","We stand for free speech. This means we are not going to ban distasteful subreddits. We will not ban legal content even if we find it odious or if we personally condemn it.","All of us at reddit work here because we think that reddit is a community like none other. We think it can be a powerful force to change the world for the better.","Reddit is where anyone can come and tell their real story.","With Facebook, you're not really allowed to be unhappy. Think about it: There's only a like button. Yes, you can be angry, but it's only lighthearted rage. On Reddit, perhaps because you can be anonymous, people are willing to be openly sad or angry. They are more honest."],"Yitzhak Navon":["Do you know why dogs are man's best friend? It's because they're not in politics.","Once, there was a time in Jerusalem of brotherhood and peace: cultures and languages lived side by side and not one at the expense of the other.","If the angel Gabriel came to me and said, 'Look, I'm willing to take your soul now and give it back to you at any period of time in the history of the nation of Israel, from the very beginning to this very day' - I think I would not think of any other time except for when Moses brought down the Ten Commandments from Mount Sinai.","6,000 people were killed, crippled, and wounded during the War of Independence. The economy was devastated - there was no milk, just milk powder. No eggs, but egg powder. Meat was only once a week.","The State of Israel is a state that was formed before the people were even in it. You have to understand: In India, in Burma, in Pakistan - all of the people were already there. Their problem was for the English to leave so they could be independent.","I grew up in Jerusalem and went to school here. I studied at the Hebrew University - mostly Islam and Arabic: Arab literature, Arab poetry and culture, because I felt like we are living in this region, in the Middle East, and we are not alone: There are nations here whose culture is Arab.","There is no other language as similar to Hebrew like Arabic.","There are Jews who came from 102 countries and speak 81 languages - how do you consolidate them into one nation? This is where I saw my role.","One way or another, Gaza's residents must live in peace with Israel."],"Yitzhak Rabin":["I believe that in the long run, separation between Israel and the Palestinians is the best solution for resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.","President Sadat of Egypt made a historic breakthrough in 1977 when he put an end to war and convinced both Egyptians and Israelis that he was ready to make peace. He broke down the walls of suspicion and prejudice.","In the Jewish tradition, there is at the same time Jerusalem in the heavens and Jerusalem on the ground. Jerusalem is a living city, but also the heart, the soul of the Jewish people and the state of Israel.","In fighting terror, you cannot let it interfere with the normal life of civilians in Israel.","We must fight terrorism as if there's no peace process and work to achieve peace as if there's no terror.","We must think differently, look at things in a different way. Peace requires a world of new concepts, new definitions.","You don't make peace with friends. You make it with very unsavory enemies.","I think that life in Israel is sometimes bigger than the movies.","We do not celebrate the death of our enemies.","It is our duty, to ourselves and to our children, to see the new world as it is now.","Israel has an important principle: It is only Israel that is responsible for our security.","I don't believe that in the name of the holiness of the city you have to put barbed wires, machine gun nests, mine pins and everything of that, in the name of the holiness of Jerusalem.","Let the Palestinians run their affairs: create a situation in which no Israeli soldier will have to maintain public order, whether in Gaza or the West Bank. Let's give it to the Palestinians, as long as there is security for us. No more occupying another people.","Jerusalem is united, will never be divided again.","I believe that it is my responsibility as the prime minister of Israel to do whatever can be done to exploit the unique opportunities that lie ahead of us to move towards peace. Not everything can be done by one act.","Practically the only way to dry the swamp of radical Islam is through economic development and an improved standard of living.","I am 73 years old. I was born in Jerusalem. I'm the first prime minister of Israel to be born here. I am the only former general to become a prime minister.","A diplomatic peace is not yet the real peace. It is an essential step in the peace process leading towards a real peace.","It is not worth the paper it is written on unless it is backed by the kind of force that will make the other side consider the penalties too heavy to break the agreement.","The struggle to get weapons is continuous, but the United States will aid us, if it finds Israel displaying a willingness for peace.","There's nothing harder than defining oneself.","You can always make peace with an F-16 in your pocket.","No Arab ruler will consider the peace process seriously so long as he is able to toy with the idea of achieving more by the way of violence.","Lebanon is a Syrian protectorate. The Lebanese dare not do anything without the approval of Damascus.","I believe however that peace is attainable regardless of the Arabs mentality, society or government.","In the midst of fighting there is no place for public debate.","The world is no longer against us.","Israel is no longer a people that dwells alone, and has to join the global journey toward peace, reconciliation and international cooperation.","Israel's willingness to cooperate closely with the U.S. in protecting American interests in the region altered her image in the eyes of many officials in Washington.","I enter negotiations with Chairman Arafat, the leader of the PLO, the representative of the Palestinian people, with the purpose to have coexistence between our two entities, Israel as a Jewish state and Palestinian state, entity, next to us, living in peace.","I would like Israel to be a Jewish state, and therefore not to annex over 2 million Palestinians who live in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip to Israel, which will make Israel a bi-national state.","Only the change on the international scene, the crisis in the gulf, and the strong, firm position of the United States against aggression between two Arab countries created realities that led to the Madrid Peace Conference.","Give peace a chance.","I don't see any reason to discriminate against homosexuals.","As far as Israel, I am not worried about the relations between Israel and the United States.","Terror cannot be finished by one war.","I don't want to be the policeman of Lebanon. It's not the business of Israel. Israel was not created to serve as a policeman of the region.","I'm trying to learn the lessons of the past, but not to make speeches about the past.","As prime minister, I changed Israel's position on peace negotiations. I made it clear that we are ready to go along with Resolution 242 of the U.N. Security Council, which specifies withdrawal to secure and recognized boundaries in the context of peace.","Although it is true that Hizballah is organized, inspired, financed, and armed by Iran, its main bases in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley are under Syrian military control.","Arafat carried out what I consider to be atrocities.","I don't pretend that I can imagine myself as a Palestinian.","Regardless of some disagreements in the past with Dr. Kissinger, I personally had a very good relationship with the secretary when I served as ambassador to the United States and later on as premier."],"Yitzhak Shamir":["Most of the Jewish refugees, stripped of their considerable possessions, came to Israel. They were welcomed by the Jewish state. They were given shelter and support, and they were integrated into Israeli society together with half a million survivors of the European Holocaust.","The Zionist movement gave political expression to our claim to the land of Israel. And in 1922, the League of Nations recognized the justice of this claim.","Israel's capital will never again be a divided city, a city with a wall at its center, a city in which two flags fly. This city, will, in its entirety, absorb immigrants, welcome pilgrims and be the eternal capital of Israel forever.","I believe that the will of the people is resolved by a strong leadership. Even in a democratic society, events depend on a strong leadership with a strong power of persuasion, and not on the opinion of the masses.","I am not afraid of taking risks. We have to take risks for peace.","If history remembers me at all, in any way, I hope it will be as a man who loved the Land of Israel and watched over it in every way he could, all his life.","Jews must be able to live with enemies and defend themselves from them. The hatred for Israel has not disappeared.","There is no better way to make peace than to talk in each other's home. Avoiding such talks is a denial of the purpose of the negotiations.","All of the land of Israel is ours.","In this part of the world, Jews and Arabs will live together forever.","We have said that Israel has had a very bad history with the United Nations, and whoever cares for himself in Israel distances himself from that Organization.","We must never bend too much.","The driving force for the Arabs is hatred of Israel. Hatred of the Jewish people.","A man who goes forth to take the life of another whom he does not know must believe one thing only - that by his act he will change the course of history.","The settlement of the Land of Israel is the essence of Zionism. Without settlement, we will not fulfill Zionism. It's that simple.","Israel's days without Jerusalem, Judea and Samaria and the Gaza Strip are gone and will not return.","Even if there is peace with all the Arab states, I don't know if the terrorism against us will pass from this world.","You don't have to be desperate. Never be desperate. That is my slogan.","Everybody knows what I represent. My message is that Israel wants peace, and I am going to do everything possible to find ways to get this peace, this objective of all our people. All of us want peace. The differences are about the conditions of this peace.","I feel alive inside only when obstacles are arising that must be overcome and eliminated.","I am miserable when everything is in order and quiet. Seriously, it's hard for me when I can go home quietly, go to sleep, and get up in the morning without fear and tension.","When we fought for freedom, for the establishment of a Jewish state, we didn't send a questionnaire to the Jewish nation asking if it wanted a Jewish state.","Zionism is a revolutionary process. And in a revolution, you must be ready not to think too much about sentiments or human weaknesses.","The United States is our best friend, and our relations are excellent. Our relations will be strengthened even more, despite our differences in views.","I'm called a terrorist in the Arab media still today.","The main aim of the Palestinians is to destroy the state of Israel.","I said it several times: a blow you are getting from a friend is still a blow, but more painful.","There is a constant effort of the Palestinian terrorist organizations to increase their presence and their forces in Lebanon.","I do not want to respond to leaks that concern things that have to do with state secrets of the first degree.","Only Arab Israel, the land of Israel, is our true homeland.","In its Declaration of Independence on May 15, 1948, Israel stretched out its hand in peace to its Arab neighbors, calling for an end to war and bloodshed. In response, seven Arab states invaded Israel. The U.N. resolution that partitioned the country was thus violated and effectively annulled.","The U.N. did not create Israel. The Jewish state came into being because the tiny Jewish community in what was mandatory Palestine rebelled against foreign imperialist rule. We did not conquer a foreign land.","In their war against Israel's existence, the Arab governments took advantage of the Cold War. They enlisted the military, economic, and political support of the communist world against Israel, and they turned a local, regional conflict into an international powder keg.","Several hundreds of thousands of Palestinian Arabs live in slums known as refugee camps in Gaza, Judea, and Somalia. Attempts by Israel to rehabilitate and oust them have been defeated by Arab objections. Nor has their fate been any better in Arab states.","Stop exposing your children to danger by sending them to throw bombs and stones at soldiers and civilians.","Wars have not solved anything in our region. They have only caused misery, suffering, bereavement, and hatred.","After '45, Ben Gurion started to organize the Zionist movement and the conference in Baltimore. At this convention, they decided that the helm of the Zionist movement has to be a Jewish commonwealth... a Jewish commonwealth!","Lehi was not a part of the Zionist movement, not a part of the Revisionist Party. It was sometimes something apart, and Lord Moyne was the highest British official in the Middle East... and because we fought against the British in this area, we took him for a target."],"Ymre Stiekema":["When you model for a show, you get this real sense of adrenaline. It's difficult when the shoes are so high - that part's quite scary - but you just have to do it.","Prada is such a huge company, and it was an honour to work with them and so early on in my career.","Doing something for Victoria's Secret would be great - I love Doutzen Kroes.

I didn't come out of my room, forget stepping out of the house. I had a beard, and I didn't get a haircut for months. For someone who has performed in front of a crowd of 20,000, I was scared of facing 4-5 people. That's what bipolar disorder does to you.","I'd never disrespect women. I have been brought up to treat women with courtesy and dignity.","I feel extremely honoured and humbled that people are showing me so much love. My fans have stood by me through thick and thin, and I think this love is what makes my concerts house-full.","I didn't have any singing background. Against the wishes of my parents, I got into making music.","I am yet to have a child, and if I am blessed with a baby girl, and in future, if a guy tries to impress my daughter by singing my hits, I have no issues with it.","I am a straight, non-alcoholic, non-partying guy who speaks straight. I have no knowledge of literature. This is my language of communication, and what I see, what I observe, I reflect.","I love my mother the most in the world. She has seen a lot of poverty and loneliness and is very simple. Whenever I am in trouble, I go far away from her, as she is not at all strong. If I see her breaking, I break.","I respect women, and I have not and will never sing anything that will upset my fans.","After ten years of struggle I reached somewhere, and then I see some people pulling me down. I tell myself that if this is what singers have to go through, I would never let my kid enter this field.","I am not anyone's brother, and I only have one younger sister. I don't consider my counterpart rappers as my brothers.","I'm sorry, but I am not interested in getting cheap popularity. I've earned my success through sincere hard work. And that's the only success I want.","No one gave me an opportunity, which I desperately needed in my struggling days. If there is one thing that I have learned during that period is that you need to create an opportunity yourself if you want to live your dream.","The Indian music scene is completely dominated by Bollywood music. We need to create space for indi-pop music.","As an artiste, I believe that I am not my own property. I am the property of my fans.","Every revolutionary poet or lyricist has been criticised for something. If you come up with something new, there will always be people who will object to it.","I think acting is the most difficult one among all the performing arts.","The guy I played in 'The Xpose' is more like a spoiled brat who likes to have his way than a villain. No more negative roles after 'The Xpose' for me. I've enough problems dealing with the negative image I've been saddled with in some sections.","After I did 'Lungi Dance' with Shah Rukh, I felt I had achieved everything there is to achieve. But then I am getting to work with Amitabh Bachchan now. And it's really the ultimate Bollywood experience for me. It really can't get any better for me.","I am overwhelmed with all the love, affection, and warmth that I have been receiving for 'Dheere Dheere.' It is one of my most special works, and I am glad that so many million hearts have taken to it in such a manner.","It's never easy for me to say goodbye. I get attached to people very quickly, and with 'Raw Stars,' my connection is even more special. I'm in love with their music and perhaps their biggest fan. I think every artiste on the show is mind-blowing.","The truth is I was suffering from bipolar disorder. It went on for 18 months, during which I changed four doctors, the medication wasn't working on me, and crazy things were happening.","When some artistes give a hit song, they keep repeating themselves in the same genre. I always try to create something new.","Everything I wear is custom made.","I got a lot of support from the entire industry, stars like Akshay Kumar. A. R. Rahman told me to keep doing the good work and not get bogged down by anything.","I am overwhelmed for whatever I have achieved so far. I give the credit to my mother and everyone who has helped me.","I don't take my work ever for granted. I still work very hard on every song and try to outdo myself every time.","When Punjabis all over the world admired my work, there was buzz in Bollywood as well.","I am happy film stars are singing in their films. I hope to work as a music director for a film where actors will sing all the songs.","Writing songs, making music, and singing is important to me, and I do all three.","I do not consume alcohol. You won't find a single picture that shows me drinking.","As an entertainer, my first responsibility is to entertain my fans who have made me who I am today. I am not a preacher who can tell youngsters what they should be doing and what they should not be doing. The youth of our country is intelligent enough to know what is good and bad, and my songs can't change their thinking.","I had to work on my own to establish myself.","It is a tough job to portray a character and make it believable on screen.","I like action-based sports, and kabbadi is my favourite. I wanted to be associated with a sport on which I really believe in, and so I bought a team in World Kabbadi League, and Toronto will host my team.","My family didn't want me to be a musician, and therefore, they never helped out in my efforts.","The kind of songs I sing have been existing in Bollywood music since a long time. In fact, the reason my music is so popular amongst the millions of youth is because I sing in their own language, in their own slang, and about their lives.","Just because I take my music international doesn't mean I have to sing in English. I will continue to sing in Punjabi, Hindi, Gujarati, and Tamil. I want to represent my own country through its own languages.","I wish to contribute more to south Indian music, especially Tamil music.","TV is the most powerful medium, which has taken me right into the homes of so many people.","I've seen my family watch TV every day, and they develop a liking for various characters more and more with time. So, I think TV does bring a celeb closer to his fans. I feel I have come closer to people without losing my raw appeal.","Music industry is a very competitive field, and one has to continuously entertain and excite the audience, which is a difficult task.","It's a misconception that I compose songs for girls. I have sung a song for Bhagat Singh, too, but nobody knows about it. I have sung about boys, but all of them are super-duper flop.","I am not interested to sing in Bollywood. I sing for only those actors whom I admire. I sing free of cost for them. I want to take independent music ahead, and my songs are completely based on my observations.","I am glad that my fan believed in me and stood by me in my hard times and continued to enjoy my songs. That's the real victory for me.","Have you driven a Rolls-Royce? There is a difference between a Rolls-Royce and a Nano.","'The Xpose' was just an experiment, a small step into Bollywood. It wasn't my acting debut, as reported in Mumbai. I've done a couple of Punjabi films.","My playground as a musician is growing.","I was looking online; many singers have sung songs for the elections, but I am not doing anything like that.","There are many politicians who are from the Congress or the BJP or the Aam Aadmi Party who are all my friends and who are all young politicians between the ages of 27 and 35.","I would never sing a song which I cannot sing in front of my family.","It was very difficult acting. I feel it is a very tough job to portray someone else's character and to behave like that on screen.","I was never seen with one girl in a video, right? My videos always had many girls.","I don't consider myself just a rapper or just a singer. I'm a music producer, lyricist. I'm a poet as well, and acting is also a part of big entertainment.","I don't want to work more. I want to do limited but good work.","I compose for very limited people in Bollywood, as I am not a playback artist. I compose my songs and sing them.","I need to focus on other things before I carry on in Bollywood. I can't be doing what I've done in 'Lungi Dance' and now the song 'Party With Bhootnath' with Bachchan over and over again. I've to reinvent myself for Bollywood.","I have fulfilled all my dreams in Bollywood. Now I have to find new dreams for Bollywood before I strike again.","I'm working on an international album which will be out soon, and Lollypop is gonna be a part of it. I want to let the world know what happens when a desi song is remixed with Honey Singh's English Tadka.","I thought I was passionate about my work. Then I saw Shah Rukh bhai and Bachchan saab at work. Their spirit was so infectious. I felt I had so far been just fooling around.","I am excited to partner with American Swan and to be able to connect with the youth and inspire them to chase their dreams and script their destinies.","I used to be the occasional social drinker earlier. But now my intake of alcohol has ceased completely. I want to be fighting fit for the boxing ring.","I never do any song with any expectation.","I'd sing for any friend's happiness. I don't have to get drunk to do so.","There are many wrestlers in my mother's family. So I guess I've inherited my love for wrestling from my mother's side of the family.","Just as I have broken the monopoly of film music as being synonymous with popular music in our country, I want to prove that cricket is not the only glamorous sport.","It's very important to get friends on board, friends who make a difference.","We want to take boxing to the level of cricket.","When I was child, I saw the 'Ram Leela' performed on stage. Now there is the film 'Ram Leela,' and its maker actually wanted me to do a song for Akshay Kumar in 'Gabbar.' Akshay was one of the first Bollywood A-listers to believe in me. We jelled before we jammed together.","I always maintained I'm a good simple boy from Punjab. Some chose not to believe me. Now the same people are happy to work with me.","Even the song that I did for Sanjay Leela Bhansali's 'Gabbar' is an old number. But working with Mr Bhansali was a dream come true.","I'd request politicians to stop diverting attention from the actual issues that affect the country. Please stop resorting to soft targets like singers and musicians as scapegoats.","I come from a business family. I rebelled from my father to become a musician.","All my songs depict a slice of life and how youngsters perceive it. My song 'Blue Eyes' is exactly the kind of conversation a 21 or 22-year-old guy will have with the girl he likes.","For a Punjabi singer to find acceptance down South is a tall task. I'm glad I earned their love and respect.","If an offer comes my way, I would love to sing in every Indian language. It will be like an ode to my fans from every corner of the country.","I started as a music director in Punjab and then started singing.","Nobody can replace Mika Singh; he is an amazing artiste and a legend.","My dream is to take the Indian independent music scene to an international level. People like Alisha Chinai, Baba Sehgal and Daler Mehndi took it to a very high level. My ultimate target is to win a Grammy. I don't want to primarily be a Bollywood playback singer.","I believe an artiste is a reflection of society. I write what I see. I am not a scholar, I am just an entertainer. I cannot change the way people think.","I was born in Delhi, have stayed and roamed the world, but had a tough childhood and career path. Only my mom and mausie supported me in music. So, I would just sing shabad kirtan to remain somehow attached to music.","In 2011, I released my first album called 'International Villager.' I had no support, and whatever money I had made, I put it all in the album. I shot the music video for 'Brown Rang' with one lakh dollars. I spent so much money, as I just wanted to put it up on YouTube, as I knew that my market was there, and it became a huge hit.","People are wrong when they say that there is struggle in Bollywood. That is only when you don't have the talent. If you have talent, Bollywood comes to you.","Fame, for me, is different. Fame, for me, is not seeing myself on big billboards: it is when I go on a street and people connect to me. If I going to walk on the street, I know I can get 100,000 people following me.","If you see me as a controversial artist or controversial human being, then I could be cashing in on some reality shows. I am not doing anything like that. That's not my aim.","I did one show in Chennai. There was this little kid, dressed up as I dressed in 'Blue Eyes.' That's fame for me.","I never wanted to be a performer, I never wanted to be Yo Yo Honey Singh, the rock star.","Girls have been suppressed for long. Crimes against women are on the rise because women have the courage to come out in the open and fight the perpetrators of these heinous crimes.","I don't understand why people are going mad about the lyrics I write? Do they expect everyone to become Mirza Ghalib?","Everyone knows it, but no one is willing to digest the fact that the lyrics comprising of slangs can also be a hit among youth.","When I composed a song on Bhagat Singh, it flopped. But my other songs about partying and all that are superhits!","My songs are based on my keen observation. I have picked these situations from my surrounding and have presented a real situation about the youth and their mindset.","We celebrate Valentine Day, but no one remembers Bhagat Singh birth anniversary.","I am either very expensive or free for my friends."],"Yo-Yo Ma":["Passion is one great force that unleashes creativity, because if you're passionate about something, then you're more willing to take risks.","Good things happen when you meet strangers.","When you learn something from people, or from a culture, you accept it as a gift, and it is your lifelong commitment to preserve it and build on it.","As you begin to realize that every different type of music, everybody's individual music, has its own rhythm, life, language and heritage, you realize how life changes, and you learn how to be more open and adaptive to what is around us.","One of the things I love about music is live performance.","Things can fall apart, or threaten to, for many reasons, and then there's got to be a leap of faith. Ultimately, when you're at the edge, you have to go forward or backward; if you go forward, you have to jump together.","Sound is ephemeral, fleeting, but some sort of a physical manifestation can help you hold on to it longer in time. I'm sure of this; I've always thought the sound that you make is just the tip of the iceberg, like the person that you see physically is just the tip of the iceberg as well.","I think one of the great things about being a musician is that you never stop learning.","After reaching 50, I began to wonder what the root of life is.","There's a part of me that's always charging ahead. I'm the curious kid, always going to the edge.","Music is powered by ideas. If you don't have clarity of ideas, you're just communicating sheer sound.","Practicing is not only playing your instrument, either by yourself or rehearsing with others - it also includes imagining yourself practicing. Your brain forms the same neural connections and muscle memory whether you are imagining the task or actually doing it.","But an innovation, to grow organically from within, has to be based on an intact tradition, so our idea is to bring together musicians who represent all these traditions, in workshops, festivals, and concerts, to see how we can connect with each other in music.","Mastering music is more than learning technical skills. Practicing is about quality, not quantity. Some days I practice for hours; other days it will be just a few minutes.","It's easy for me to care about Toronto, because Toronto is a community that cares about itself. It represents the world. It talks to itself, and because it does, it figures out that there must be a music garden as part of its existence.","I love grocery shopping when I'm home. That's what makes me feel totally normal. I love both the idea of home as in being with my family and friends, and also the idea of exploration. I think those two are probably my great interests.","I think that peace is, in many ways, a precondition of joy.","The role of the musician is to go from concept to full execution. Put another way, it's to go from understanding the content of something to really learning how to communicate it and make sure it's well-received and lives in somebody else.","The tango is really a combination of many cultures, though it eventually became the national music of Argentina.","I think the purpose of a piece of music is significant when it actually lives in somebody else. A composer puts down a code, and a performer can activate the code in somebody else. Once it lives in somebody else, it can live in others as well.","When we have a good balance between thinking and feeling... our actions and lives are always the richer for it.","Music has always been transnational; people pick up whatever interests them, and certainly a lot of classical music has absorbed influences from all over the world.","There are limits to how much sound a cello can make. That's part of the framing of acoustical instruments. Finding what those limits might be, and then trying to suggest perhaps even the illusion of going beyond is part of that kind of effort.","A composition is always more than the sum of its parts. In other words, a really good piece of music is more than itself. It's sort of like a prism, which you can see from each facet a single totality.","I remember when I was growing up. My great wish was to understand who I was and how I fit in the world.","I think all musicians have at one time or another experienced one physical problem or another. I have had tendinitis a couple of times, so I try to be really careful. It takes patience and persistence to overcome injury.","With every year of playing, you want to relax one more muscle. Why? Because the more tense you are, the less you can hear.","It took me way beyond what I knew, into places of which I was totally scared, but as I became less frightened, I welcomed new ways of thinking and approaching something. It made me an infinitely richer person, and I think a better musician.","One is that you have to take time, lots of time, to let an idea grow from within. The second is that when you sign on to something, there will be issues of trust, deep trust, the way the members of a string quartet have to trust one another.","I think of a piece of music as something that comes alive when it is being performed, and I feel that my role in the transmission of music is to be its best advocate at that moment.","I think there are so many ways to become interested in music. I believe signs of sustained interest gives a sense of the right time. Music, if thought of as a language, would perhaps indicate that as early as possible is not so bad. I do believe that a really nurturing first teacher that makes the child love something is crucial.","My job as a performer is to make sure that whatever happens in a performance lives in somebody else, that it's memorable... If you forget tomorrow what you heard yesterday, there's really not much point in you having been there - or me, for that matter.","People will ask, 'Are you famous?' And I always answer, 'My mother thinks so.'","You go through phases. You have to reinvent reasons for playing, and one year's answer might not do for another.","Children, in a way, are constant learners. Certainly sponge-like. Absorbing everything without careful analysis, even though, at the same time, they are certainly capable of incredible insights.","We may be coming to a new golden age of instrument making.","I think anybody who goes away finds you appreciate home more when you return.","I'm not likely to forget where I've been and what I've done and learned. I think it's just as important to play new instruments as to play new pieces. The old ones are getting scarcer and the new ones more and more wonderful.","I've been traveling all over the world for 25 years, performing, talking to people, studying their cultures and musical instruments, and I always come away with more questions in my head than can be answered.","Many of the Central Asians know Russian, and Ted Levin speaks it fluently. I speak Chinese, but Mongolian is completely different, so we had to have translators.","One of the most interesting aspects of the film project was collaborating with so many people - directors, filmmakers, and writers - over a five-year period. I learned that there are two components to this.","I learn something not because I have to, but because I really want to. That's the same view I have for performing. I'm performing because I really want to, not because I have to bring bread back home.","I really would like to be involved in things and to understand things, and in some ways you've got to be careful what you wish for because I feel very, very blessed to have such an interesting life and to be able to have little snapshots of lives of people from many different parts of the world.","The thing that I've always been slightly frustrated with, was that the idea of a CD is kind of confined to a material possession that you can put on a shelf. And the idea of music, for me, is always about both the communication and the sharing of content. And so the interactive part is missing.","Jazz has been such a force in music, that any musician, including classical composers, have been influenced, and obviously performers, also.","My teacher, my great cello teacher Leonard Rose, was such a great cellist, and nurturing man, very patient. But I grew up not only admiring him, but obviously Casals, Rostrotovich, Jacqueline du Pre, and many others, including many of my peers and contemporaries.","What came up at age 49 is I realized that of all the things I'm interested in, the thing I'm most interested in is figuring out what makes people tick, why people think the way they do, why they act the way they do. And I realized that music is such a great way to investigate why people do what they do.","The tradition of classical music and the opera is such that it used to be the place where social intercourse could take place between all parts of society: politicians, industrialists, artists, citizens, etc. That tradition, I think, still exists, but it's much, much more diluted.","You know, you can have someone who's the very best at something, but if there's not that kind of chemistry, collaborating is not going to amount to anything.","My involvement in the political arena is to make sure there's a place for culture.","I realized late in life that my twin passions are music and people.","As a musician I'm kind of nomadic, Waldo-like. I show up in different places, and I'm witness to unbelievable things.","Once something is memorable, it's living and you're using it. That to me is the foundation of a creative society.","As a child, you respond physically, tactically. You're delighted by sound, you're delighted by recognizing something. It's like hide and seek. Is it there? Is it not there? Is it this note? Is it not this note? It's one fantastic game."],"Yochai Benkler":["Judges wear legal professionalism and precedent as a mantel that secures legitimacy for their decisions. It's how they distinguish themselves from politicians or administrative agencies, while wielding power that is sometimes much greater than those democratically accountable actors.","One of the problems of writing and working and looking at the Internet is that it's very hard to separate fashion from deep change.","Computation, storage, and communications capacity are in the hands of practically every connected person - and these are the basic physical capital means necessary for producing information, knowledge and culture, in the hands of something like 600 million to a billion people around the planet.","Next time you open the paper, and you see an intellectual property decision, a telecoms decision, it's not about something small and technical. It is about the future of the freedom to be as social beings with each other, and the way information, knowledge and culture will be produced.","Technology has enabled government to have investigative and situational awareness on a scale and scope that were science fiction when the Stasi shut its doors.","As long as government is allowed to collect all Internet data, the perceived exigency will drive honest civil servants to reach more broadly and deeply into our networked lives.","Bringing an end to mass government surveillance needs to be a central pillar of returning to the principles we have put in jeopardy in the early 21st century.","We suffered a terrible blow on 11 September 2001. We responded with fear and anger. A fight-or-flight response is adaptive in any species. For us, given our power, fight was the only response we could imagine.","Like crime, terrorism is a fact of life. I grew up in Israel, where every unattended bag was a suspected bomb; when my family moved for a few years, it was to London in the early years of 'the Troubles.'","On 11 September, I was living in Greenwich Village, New York; my children learned to tell south from north by looking at the World Trade Center.","I know terrorism is real. And I know fear of it distorts public judgment. Terrorism is like a chronic illness. We have to learn to contain it and live with it.","Seeing Anonymous primarily as a cybersecurity threat is like analyzing the breadth of the antiwar movement and 1960s counterculture by focusing only on the Weathermen.","Anonymous is not an organization. It is an idea, a zeitgeist, coupled with a set of social and technical practices."],"Yoenis Cespedes":["I grew up on the softball field. Every day I would take my glove and my bat with me.","In Cuba, I didn't even have a bicycle.","I had a chance to play for the Cuban national team during the 2009 World Baseball Classic, but at the time I never thought about leaving Cuba.","Despite the situation in Cuba, I had a chance to play on the national team; and compared to other baseball players and other people in Cuba, I had the opportunity to live at a level that was not very high class but in the middle.","Sometimes I rush my swing because I am so anxious to play well. In Cuba, the quality of the pitching is not the same as it is here. There you might find one or two pitchers at 94 or 95 mph. Here, every day I find several, and each pitcher who comes along throws his hardest stuff.","In Cuba, I would start the first two months hitting around .260 with three or four home runs. After the first half of the season, I would get hot, and that's when I would have my best results.","My life has changed in many ways, both on an economic and personal level. All major league players are accorded the respect they deserve. In Cuba, it was not that way. National team players were not respected. The treatment was not adequate."],"Yogi Berra":["You better cut the pizza in four pieces because I'm not hungry enough to eat six.","Love is the most important thing in the world, but baseball is pretty good, too.","If you don't know where you are going, you might wind up someplace else.","If you ask me anything I don't know, I'm not going to answer.","I wish I had an answer to that because I'm tired of answering that question.","Little League baseball is a very good thing because it keeps the parents off the streets.","Baseball is ninety percent mental and the other half is physical.","It ain't the heat, it's the humility.","When you come to a fork in the road, take it.","I never said most of the things I said.","In theory there is no difference between theory and practice. In practice there is.","You can observe a lot by watching.","Congratulations. I knew the record would stand until it was broken.","You don't have to swing hard to hit a home run. If you got the timing, it'll go.","I'm not going to buy my kids an encyclopedia. Let them walk to school like I did.","It's like deja-vu, all over again.","I never blame myself when I'm not hitting. I just blame the bat and if it keeps up, I change bats. After all, if I know it isn't my fault that I'm not hitting, how can I get mad at myself?","If you come to a fork in the road, take it.","You can observe a lot by just watching.","You wouldn't have won if we'd beaten you.","If the world were perfect, it wouldn't be.","Slump? I ain't in no slump... I just ain't hitting.","How can you think and hit at the same time?","He hits from both sides of the plate. He's amphibious.","It ain't over till it's over.","The future ain't what it used to be.","You should always go to other people's funerals; otherwise, they won't come to yours.","I usually take a two-hour nap from one to four.","Always go to other people's funerals, otherwise they won't come to yours.","I think Little League is wonderful. It keeps the kids out of the house.","I was in the invasion of Normandy in southern France.","It's fun; baseball's fun.","You've got to be very careful if you don't know where you are going, because you might not get there.","The towels were so thick there I could hardly close my suitcase.","If people don't want to come out to the ball park, nobody's gonna stop 'em.","I tell the kids, somebody's gotta win, somebody's gotta lose. Just don't fight about it. Just try to get better.","I always got nervous the nights we played in the World Series. First pitch, I was nervous. Then after that, forget it; I'd start playing.","We have deep depth.","Baseball is ninety percent mental. The other half is physical.","It was impossible to get a conversation going, everybody was talking too much.","Half the lies they tell about me aren't true.","When you arrive at a fork in the road, take it.","Nobody goes there anymore. It's too crowded.","I enjoy now doing what I do... playing golf, relaxing a little, enjoying life.","I never figured I'd go into the Hall of Fame. A kid from the Hill.","There are some people who, if they don't already know, you can't tell 'em.","We made too many wrong mistakes.","I'm glad I was in the Navy.","If the people don't want to come out to the ballpark, nobody's going to stop them.","Baseball is 90 percent mental and the other half is physical.","Almost every Monday I have a charity thing. I like that. I do.","It gets late early out there.","Pair up in threes.","All pitchers are liars or crybabies.","It's pretty far, but it doesn't seem like it.","I never said half the things I said.","In baseball, you don't know nothing.","A nickel ain't worth a dime anymore.","Even Napoleon had his Watergate.","I always thought that record would stand until it was broken.","I just want to thank everyone who made this day necessary.","I don't mean to be funny.","If you get a guy that can play a couple positions, it helps you out a real lot.","A lot of guys go, 'Hey, Yog, say a Yogi-ism.' I tell 'em, 'I don't know any.' They want me to make one up. I don't make 'em up. I don't even know when I say it. They're the truth. And it is the truth. I don't know.","If I didn't make it in baseball, I won't have made it workin'. I didn't like to work.","The other teams could make trouble for us if they win.","I'm lucky. Usually you're dead to get your own museum, but I'm still alive to see mine.","If people don't want to come to the ballpark, how are you going to stop them?","So I'm ugly. So what? I never saw anyone hit with his face.","I'm a lucky guy and I'm happy to be with the Yankees. And I want to thank everyone for making this night necessary.","I didn't know much about golf growing up.","I liked St. Louis, when they were in the American League, because that was going home. I had all my family and friends there.","I liked George Weiss when he was with the Yankees. He loved the Old Timers' Day. He loved it. And he invited all these people to come, all these players to come.","I don't like seeing myself on television. I don't like it.","I guess I've got a smart wife.","I don't blame the players today for the money. I blame the owners. They started it. They wanna give it to 'em?

It was a really tough life.","Cricket is my first love.","I work twice as hard as everybody else.","I've always been working just to be a world champion and it's a dream come true.","If you can come to the Olympic Games and leave with a medal then that is alright.","My philosophy is to be me.","I would like to be a legend, everyone wants to be a legend.","The 100m taught me a lot and it's given me confidence.","I'm like a beast. I just take it out on the track.","When you guys are sleeping at night, I am out there working.","When my coach gives me a program, I damage it.","I don't need to scare the other athletes. When I'm running, I will scare them.","I love London, I love the British people.","The track is fast and I appreciate anything is possible.","For me, I always try to make it to the final.","It's nerve wracking being in the stadium with so many people supporting.","Some you win some you lose.","One thing I really hate is experience. Experience for me doesn't work. Everybody's talking about experience this, experience that."],"Yoko Ono":["Smile in the mirror. Do that every morning and you'll start to see a big difference in your life.","A dream you dream alone is only a dream. A dream you dream together is reality.","Every moment in our lives is a miracle we should enjoy instead of ignoring.","Being alone is very difficult.","The regret of my life is that I have not said 'I love you' often enough.","I realized that if my thoughts immediately affect my body, I should be careful about what I think. Now if I get angry, I ask myself why I feel that way. If I can find the source of my anger, I can turn that negative energy into something positive.","The sky is always there for me, while my life has been going through many, many changes. When I look up the sky, it gives me a nice feeling, like looking at an old friend.","Every drop in the ocean counts.","Healing yourself is connected with healing others.","You change the world by being yourself.","Experiencing sadness and anger can make you feel more creative, and by being creative, you can get beyond your pain or negativity.","Sometimes I am happy and sometimes not. I am, after all, a human being, you know. And I am glad that we are sometimes happy and sometimes not. You get your wisdom working by having different emotions.","You can be very wild and still be very wise.","This society is driven by neurotic speed and force accelerated by greed and frustration of not being able to live up to the image of men and woman we have created for ourselves; the image has nothing to do with the reality of people.","There's a long life ahead of you and it's going to be beautiful, as long as you keep loving and hugging each other.","If your life changes, we can change the world, too.","My heart is mysteriously alive in the world of sounds - a totally different dimension from the daily life.","In the '60s we fought for peace, when the Vietnam war was on. We were against the cops and against the politicians, and there was a lot of waving banners and all that. And I think in a way, just as they were enjoying that machoism of war, we were enjoying the machismo of being anti-war, you know?","People think that their world will get smaller as they get older. My experience is just the opposite. Your senses become more acute. You start to blossom.","Controversy is part of the nature of art and creativity.","We're growing up together, the human race. And we've discovered a lot of things that we didn't know. We're finding our way. Instead of thinking about doomsday all the time, think about how beautiful the world is. We're all together, and together we're getting wiser.","The human race is a very, very magical race. We have a magic power of witches and wizards. We're here on this earth to unravel the mystery of this planet. The planet is asking for it.","Words are power. And a book is full of words. Be careful what power you get from it. But know that you do.","I'm kind of honored to be a dragon lady. The dragon is a very powerful, mythical animal.","I admire all people who are trying to be a good power in this chaotic world.","People say that this new generation is so used to the Internet that their heads are already different. They can't read a book from beginning to end. That is not a tragedy. The book changes form.","A lot of things have been thrown at me in life, and I've got through it all without a rule book, taking it one day at a time.","Great Art is Great because it inspired you greatly. If it didn't, no matter what the critics, the museums and the galleries say, it's not great art for you.","The nice thing about the gallery shows is that without having to pay any money you can just go and see it.","I relate to happiness as an ecstatic moment - something you don't create, you encounter.","John wrote with a very deep love for the human race and a concern for its future.","I did not break up the Beatles. You can't have it both ways. If you're going to blame me for breaking the Beatles up, you should be thankful that I made them into myth rather than a crumbling group.","To me, the concept of distance is not important. Distance doesn't exist, in fact, and neither does time. Vibrations from love or music can be felt everywhere, at all times.","There's many women now who think, 'Surely we don't need feminism anymore, we're all liberated and society's accepting us as we are'. Which is just hogwash. It's not true at all.","True artists are prophets. I don't want to be that prophetic in that sense because it's so lonely.","Performance art is going to be the future. Plays on Broadway are so restricted. But performance art is like haikus, just one line thing. And it's more casual but more interesting.","Women have become stronger, and there's a backlash. Men have become terribly possessive. I find it much easier to get on with women.","Losing my daughter was a very serious pain. There was always some empty space in my heart.","Chemically speaking or biologically, we research things, but we don't know half of them. We only know our half of it - symbolically - and we don't know ourselves more than half.","I think that there is incredible prejudice about witches while there is no prejudice about wizards. Words are very important, and I'm really into destroying myths.","DJs are in incredible competition, musically. And they are the most musically creative and sensitive people in all the music charts. I am amazed how they are.","Nobody's life is a bed of roses. We all have crosses to bear, and we all just do our best. I would never claim to have the worst situation. There are many widows, and many people dying of AIDS, many people killed in Lebanon, people starving all over the planet. So we have to count our lucky stars.","Distance doesn't exist, in fact, and neither does time. Vibrations from love or music can be felt everywhere, at all times.","When you go through a negative situation, don't think about it. Make it positive.","I'm very thankful that I can make people happy just by signing my name.","Art is like breathing for me. If I don't do it, I start to choke.","Energy is so important. If you don't have it, don't bother with rock and roll.","We are all dreamers creating the next world, the next beautiful world for ourselves and for our children.","We artists have the dignity to tell the truth to the people, unlike politicians.","The thing that would most improve my life is 27 hours in a day. I could meet all my deadlines.","Events are the best teacher for us. You try to learn from people, there is always some bend to it.","I am extremely rebellious. I have this strong, defiant spirit.","I don't think you should always stay calm in a tense situation, because you might not ever confront the problem. Maybe it's better to actually let yourself be tense - and find a solution.","Women are very intelligent and not appreciated. We try to pretend that we are not clever, and it's such a pity that we can't show how clever we are.","Marriage is a gamble, let's be honest.","I don't believe in a chronological way of doing things.","When people ask me what the most important thing is in life, I answer: 'Just breathe.'","The computer is my favourite invention. I feel lucky to be part of the global village. I don't mean to brag, but I'm so fast with technology. People think it all seems too much, but we'll get used to it. I'm sure it all seemed too much when we were learning to walk.","When you go to war, both sides lose totally.","Remember, each one of us has the power to change the world. Just start thinking peace, and the message will spread quicker than you think.","We know that our cells are speaking to each other.","Our public officials have forgotten that they are ultimately accountable to the people who put them in office, that the information they keep in secrecy belongs to all of us.","Society tells you that when you're old you have to retire. You have to defy that.","If you have too many quotes from other people in your head, you can't create. You have to keep your head empty. That's why I am constantly enjoying the sky, the park, the walk.","My father was a banker, but he was an independent spirit. He was a very good pianist and very much into music.","I'm not interested so much in collaboration. You see that from the history of my albums.","I think if you give in and accept society's stereotypes, then you start thinking, 'I cannot dance till late at night because I'm 70.'","I thought art was a verb, rather than a noun.","I like artists who have something to say, not wallpaper.","People just love to be entertained, and in order to entertain them, you have to do things in a way that they understand.","It's a waste of time to think that if you colored a painting red what might have happened if you painted it black.","I just go with the flow, so any style can be in my music - that makes it exciting.","I think of John every day. I do try to block it, but December 8th is not the only day I think of him.","What we do really affects the world. Most of us think we can't do anything, but it really isn't true.","The cynicism that you have is not your real soul.","I trust myself. You need that to survive.","People are still thinking of solving problems by violence and war, and that has to stop.","We don't live by just sleeping and eating. We need pride and dignity in our lives. Work gives you that."],"Yolanda Adams":["It's not just about getting a song on the radio or appearing on television. It really is about helping people change their lives one day at a time.","Good food is healthy food. Food is supposed to sustain you so you can live better, not so you can eat more. Some people eat to live, and some people live to eat.","There is a sound that comes from gospel music that doesn't come from anything else. It is a sound of peace. It is a sound of, 'I'm going to make it through all of this.'","I was brought up by great parents and great grandparents who told me, 'Never, ever think that you're better than anyone else or that what you do is so important that the world won't miss you once you're gone,' and I kind of translate that into the stardom thing.","My direction has never really changed, because I don't think that you can really work gimmicks in gospel music. With gospel music, there is this central theme that always comes around about the love of God, the love of Jesus and the power that you have through Jesus Christ. You don't need a gimmick when you have that.","You can live a wonderful life, you can love God with all your heart, and you can love your husband or wife very passionately and have a balance in your life. I live by balance.","As humans, we have the tendency to call on God only when we think that we're in dire straits as opposed to cultivating a real relationship with Him every day. And that's what my music tries to convey to all the listeners - try to cultivate it every day.","People love gospel music. It's calming. It's soothing. It gets right to the point of whatever you're dealing with.","Of course, my faith has a lot to do with being able to be public without being a public nuisance.","God is love. He loves everybody. He loves you.","I'm very involved with kids because after being a teacher for seven years, I just can't stop loving the kids. I am a teacher forever.","You don't just become number one because you sing like everybody else. There is something different you bring to the table. Make sure you are constantly getting into the newest technologies. Learn the history of what you do, and always respect the ones who came before you.","Luckily, I don't have to be anybody but Yolanda, because people don't expect me to be anything other than who I am. For an artist, it's a great place to be.","The only time I really eat out is when I'm on the road. Then, I make the same choices that I would make at home - salmon and lots of oily fish and veggies.","I think more people in the mainstream, folks like Nancy Wilson and Luther Vandross, they have openly expressed their love for God, and when mainstream artists start expressing their love for God openly in their concerts and including gospel songs in their concert, and, you know, people started embracing it.","I truly believe that my songs bring the answers and the solutions, as opposed to just talking about the problems. My music at its core is joyful.","The great thing about Gospel is that you don't have to have an album every year in order to keep working.","Tramaine Hawkins has been a mentor, a confidante and an example of greatness. She has been through a lot in her life, and her career has spanned over 50 years. To me, that's what you call a legend.","I started out in a professional choir at 13 years old. We traveled to different places, and I had a close relationship with the leaders of our choir. We were recording when I was 15, so it wasn't like I had to wait until 25 to find out certain things.","When I write a song, it comes from the heart and is based on a specific experience. You can't really say that one experience is greater than another, because all of your experiences take you through life on this journey.","Education helps you to be a well-rounded person, period. It teaches you how to take in information and data, process it, and use it for life building. Education was key in my family. You were going to college.","Nobody talks about how Puffy went to Howard University or about Lil Wayne attending the University of Houston. All the young kids know is what they see on the videos. They don't realize that these guys have taken managerial and business courses, and know how to brand and how to market themselves. They're very smart.","I didn't grow up in one of those restrictive Christian households where you couldn't do this or that. We were brought up with a great collection of good morals and good values, but we also had fun. We'd go to church on Sunday, but then have ice cream, roller skate or play in the park afterwards.","Those of us who are blessed, we owe it to our fellow citizens and folks who we are around to do something special for them.","When you win a Grammy... you're thinking about you winning. It is amazing. Your peers and folks in the record business are saying, 'This is what we think of you.' And that's why the Grammy will always be, to me, the ultimate in what you get as far as a music trophy, because it is the one.","You have to take criticism with a grain of salt because you're never going to please everybody.","I do a medley of hymns in all of my sets, whether I'm in an arena, in a theater, in an amusement park.","Gospel is just the truth of the word of God. Anybody can sing it, anybody; anybody can perform it.","The more I grow, and the older I get, the more I am enjoying my life and know how precious it really is.","I cook everything from Italian to Cajun food. I have now mastered the roux for gumbo. I love cooking.","All of my lyrics are based on the one thing that's never failed me, and that's the Word of God.","I truly do have the most amazing child on the face of the earth. I know all parents say that about their child, but Taylor truly is special.","I'm very respectful in everything I wear. I think about it."],"Yolanda Hadid":["I believe forgiveness is the best form of love in any relationship. It takes a strong person to say they're sorry and an even stronger person to forgive.","I have learned that friendship isn't about who you've known the longest, it's about who came and never left your side.","Some people come into our life as a blessing, while others come into our life as a lesson, so love them for who they are instead of judging them for who they are not.","Fake friends believe in rumors. Real friends believe in you.","I'm convinced that probably everyone you meet is fighting a battle you know nothing about. It's just one more reason to always try to be kind.","I wasn't born with a silver spoon in Beverly Hills, but I was born with a great deal of self-worth.","I choose to live in the present because when you suffer from chronic illness, you don't have a choice. It's day by day, one foot in front of the other. When there is a good day, you soak up that moment. Those 'good selfie' moments are captured because they're a gift.","Looking good and feeling like death is a difficult combination for people to understand.","Nothing better than a good laugh and giggling over a whole bunch of nothing.","I have faith that God often uses our deepest pain as the launching pad of our greatest calling.","I can sleep fine at night knowing that even though my honesty might not translate very diplomatically, the words I speak have good intent, and I live my life with great integrity.","It took me a while to learn the true meaning of patience and surrender, but I have finally accepted that healing doesn't happen on our schedule. It doesn't have a clock or a calendar.","Since losing my health, I also feel strongly about making each new day worthwhile.","Forgiveness for one's self is the only way we can keep going through life and give ourselves the best chance at being the best people we can be.","There is nothing harder for me than to sit at the sideline, not being able to be productive.","Unfortunately but absolutely fair to all, the one thing money can't buy is health - and happiness.","When the chips are down, life forces you to take inventory and reevaluate the people in your life.","I will not allow anyone to shut me up or shame me into silence, and I'm not going to rot away behind closed doors.","I am certainly not drama-free in my life, and I used to be a lot more feisty, but I have arrived at a place where I really try to not sweat the small stuff anymore.","I believe acknowledging our own mistakes is half the problem solved.","Trash talk is dangerous, especially when it comes from hearsay.","I am extremely proud of my heritage, and I would never use being Dutch as an excuse but rather an explanation of our cultural differences.","I have always said, '40 is the new 20,' and I truly believe that, but it for sure takes a lot of hard work, education, and discipline to keep it all together as we make our way to 50 and beyond.","Lyme has brought me to my knees; this disease is a silent killer and does not have a face.","At 12 years old, I raised a premature baby cow on our farm because her mom had died. I bottle-fed it every day, let it suck on my chin, and babied it until it was stable.","I am righteous and not afraid to speak my truth. My delivery might not always be as diplomatic as I would like it to be, but my words are truthful - spoken from the heart and to the point.","We who suffer from chronic Lyme can only ask for our loved ones to try to understand and be compassionate about this invisible disease.","In 2013, after a challenging two years of long-term IV antibiotics and six weeks at a clinic in florida, I received the 'Star Light' award from the Lyme Research Alliance for my advocacy and strength to light the way of Lyme disease awareness.","I believe the only thing constant in life is change. That's just the way it is, no?","The core of people don't change... what you see is what you get.","We are all blessed to be on the Bravo train because it's a fantastic platform for meeting new people, getting our messages out there, and connecting with fans around the world.","The tabloids so easily throw people under the bus for a one-day sensation on the newsstand but sadly don't care about the long-term damage it does to those involved.","It's sad that people forget sometimes that there is a whole legitimate world of artists and actors out there that work their entire life, every day on perfecting their craft, but yet don't get any acknowledgement for their extraordinary commitment to their profession.","I believe the core of most of us women is very simple. We want to feel appreciated, acknowledged, and something as simple as flowers with a little note or some love letters goes a long way.","Having lost my own father at such a young age, I have a soft spot for dads in general, but especially for Guy Glanville. He is a really good man inside who loves his family but may not always be capable of showing that.","I think I'm a disciplined mom versus a strict mom. But also, that job - the disciplining was from birth until about 12, and at 12, I set my kids free, and they learned to become independent human beings.","Every essential oil has a healing purpose, so I think it's a great gift because it's something that elevates your mood and your health.","I do have my insecurities, but I feel good in my skin, and my heart is full of love.","Getting chronic Lyme disease is probably the fastest way to figure out what and who is real in your life.","The Lyme disease had so severely affected my brain functioning that it was extremely hard for me to think, form sentences, and stay focused.","My life is raw, authentic, and focused on giving back to the journey God has given me; I want to leave this earth a better place with answers and education on Lyme and invisible chronic disease.","All of my gifts really come from a place of healing. I have homemade essential oils with a diffuser, which I've given to all my kids.","I love to give crystals.","My favorite holiday memory is making gingerbread houses. It's something I've done with my children since they were born.","There is very little magic in the world of the chronically ill.","At some point, you just learn to surrender to your path.","Although I am not Jewish, I have been to many Friday night Shabbats at my friends houses, and I absolutely love it. It's a great and inspiring tradition to keep the family close.","I was raised to take pride in homemaking, and it's something that I always love to do. I know I share that pride with millions of other women all over the world. It's a good feeling, and it makes me happy.","When done with heart, commitment, and integrity, every job is equally important.","I took the same pride in my dishwashing job as a child as I take in running my company today.","I grew up cleaning stalls and milking cows.","I love the American openness and use of language; I just don't know how to be that way.","Establishing a friendship after divorce takes great effort and a lot of swallowing of your pride and ego.","Trash talk is poisonous and a bad habit!","There are many different shapes of friendships to be had.","I will continue to pave the way and share my health journey with the world until I find a cure and proper diagnostic testing for this silent killer called Lyme disease.","I never liked big parties, especially going alone. I much prefer smaller gatherings that are more intimate.","It's hard for me to be involved in superficial friendships with other women.","I was raised in Holland, where race and homosexuality are not a subject matter but rather a part of life.","Finding that financial independence away from a broken relationship is probably one of the most powerful places a woman can get to.","The only reason I ever shared my health journey with the world was because I felt it to be my duty to sufferers that are bed-ridden and dying because there has yet to be found a proper diagnostic test for Lyme Disease in this country.","I have worked since I was 12 years old and started providing for my family in Holland by the age of 17 - and I still do today.","When struggling to get out of bed in the morning due to pain and exhaustion, the last thing on the priority list is going to get a blow dry.","I am so grateful for my children who remind me every day what matters in life, and I feel fortunate to be their mommy and share their special love.","I'm not very diplomatic and wear my heart on my sleeve.","As a woman who experienced infidelity firsthand, I will always advise my girlfriends to only trust their husbands 95 percent and leave 5 percent for human error.","I always like to remind myself that the most honorable people of all are not those who never make mistakes, but those who admit to them when they do and then move on and do their best to right the wrongs they have made.","People probably perceive me as a bit boring because I am a little slow in the humor department, but it's just hard for me to get jokes when they're told in English. I am always the last one to get it.","The Lakers and the Clippers teams play against each other; friends shouldn't.","Having been raised very disciplined, I had to iron for my mom every Friday afternoon after school.","I feel that when you take the responsibility to host something, it is your job to make sure that all your guests are taken care of equally.","Being raised by a Catholic father, a Protestant mother, and marrying the Muslim father of my three children, I encourage people to respect and at least try to understand different religions.","You don't really know what your children are made of until the mommy engine of the family shuts down, and they are forced to step up and become the care-takers.","I have been driven by romance my whole life because I crave the intimacy that comes with that.","I have tried the fancy, superficial life in my past, but I quickly learned that diamonds are not my best friend.","Religion is a very sensitive subject and reason for wars all over the world.","As a nurturer, I have always lived my life running for others, trying to make everyone happy, even if I often overlooked my own needs. I do it because it makes me happy and fulfilled.","I am proud to be an American and finally call this my home!","I am open and respect everyone's religious and spiritual choices because at the end of the day, in my opinion, I hope that we are all praying to the same God.","Being acknowledged and appreciated by your child and stepchild is the greatest gift for all the hard work we put in as parents.","Nobody likes to be judged, including me, but I am the first to say that I am far from perfect.","Even though I struggle with severe diminished brain function, I take 100 percent responsibility for every word that comes out of my mouth and gladly admit to my mistakes.","I have never in my life let a man disrespect me, verbally or physically, and that will never change. I feel very strongly about this because it's something my mother instilled in me and that I have instilled in my daughters.","Lyme disease has become a fast epidemic worldwide. I am determined to help find a cure and figure out a way to share knowledge with the millions of people struggling with this debilitating disease.","I have always been fascinated with romance and the fact that it is so effortless when we first fall in love but how it then becomes a conscious effort to stay creative and connected. Thats why I always say, 'Get wise: keep your romance alive.'","'Through sickness and through health' sounds so simple on your wedding day, but in reality, they become significant words that are a huge responsibility and show true character to navigate.","It's interesting as a mom to reflect on your own parenting skills. The core of our beliefs may stay the same, but our perspective changes over the years and evolves with each child that comes through us.","I love each of my kids in unique ways and try to meet their different needs so they can thrive and be their personal best.","I never had the college experience, so I have raised my girls to be more work-oriented and motivated to be financially independent.","Life doesn't always go according to plan, and we don't always act in a way that represents who we are. What matters is that these moments become teaching moments.","No matter how old we are, there is nothing better then getting the approval from our parents and the sense that they are proud of our accomplishments in life.","The ALS ice bucket challenge was really the most brilliant publicity stunt of 2014, and it has brought worldwide awareness for a barely-known disease.","A lot of great medicines and ancient therapies are blocked by the FDA, so that's why I choose to travel and recognize the value of diverse points of view in medicine.","Becoming chronically ill has definitely given me a greater understanding of human nature, and I've learned to accept people's lack of long-term compassion for others while they live their busy lives.","The life of any chronically ill person becomes extremely isolating.","In my culture, whispering in the company of others is considered rude.","Anyone that was raised with a Germanic language will agree that our tone is strong, especially once translated into English.","While the majority of my career has relied on my aesthetics and how I look, I worked hard at keeping a spiritual connection with what was most important, what is inside me.","I understand now that my soul is my power, not perfection or my ego. I continue to teach this to my children, despite their glamorous careers. If we can maintain our core values, the exteriors take second place and become a gift, a source of gratitude.","I used to think I had and needed so many friends to feel loved. I know now that if you have one or two, you are good. More than that, you are great."],"Yolandi Visser":["People are flying you places in business class. Everyone wants to take pictures of you and find out information about you. It's a freak-out. But the more you push boundaries, the more you get ahead.","I always make a decision, even if it's the wrong one. I hate being confused.","Ninja is super-ambitious - more than I am.","It's weird how people were always asking us, 'Are you real? Are you joking?' That seems like something Americans care about a lot. You can't answer the question 'Are you real?' If we're anything, we're documentary fiction.","You can't try and make something you think someone else will like. You can only make what you like. How can you make a song that Yo-Landi Visser likes? You don't know me. You'll never understand me.","I've always had that maternal thing: that connection with street kids and people who are misfits.","I am Afrikaans. It wasn't ever something that I thought about.","Zef is, you're poor, but you're fancy. You're poor, but you're sexy; you've got style.","I roll with bodyguards when I go back home to South Africa.","I got irritated with people asking us the same questions. Like, 'Are you a real band?' Journalists wanted to slay us, tried to cut us down, and I just started caring less and less about doing interviews. With Facebook and Instagram, you kind of don't need to anyway. But now and again, we'll do something when there's new information to share.","I wanted to be a cool mom. It was hectic. I felt very isolated for a long time, but in the end, it was cool because it helped me and Ninja stick together. If we hadn't, we would have maybe drifted.","It was hard to write or compose... we just had to go back and finish making songs. If we make 20 songs, we'll throw away 10.","Attention, it just comes and goes. Since we don't have a major label, it's like, what are we gonna do next? You have to make your own decisions.","Leaving Interscope was not a personal thing. These record companies are a certain kind of machine, and we weren't able to function in it.","My hair was long with a fringe, and people would make jokes, calling me Britney and Lady Gaga.","I used to be into Bjork and PJ Harvey, and they used to blow my mind. But there hasn't been a pop star blowing anybody's mind.","Our music's got flavor; it's got skill. And we present it really well.","Music, for me, is just about where you're at, and that's always changing.","For me, with music, there is no half-stepping. This is my calling.","Lots of people speak Afrikaans. It's not a statement; it's just a language that we use to communicate. It has its own flavour; it's got its own slang. People laugh. People like it. They like us being open.","How do you open up? I didn't know how to.","People thought we were a joke because we got noticed so fast.","You can't get emotional about your work.","It doesn't matter if you've been working hard on something for six months. If you realize a track is wack, you have to throw it away. A lot of people can't do that.","You always gotta do what you like. If it connects, it's a miracle, but it happened with Die Antwoord.","I work with Ninja, Ninja works with me."],"Yoon Ahn":["We've just been nostalgic about old-school hip hop, listening to it at home and looking at people like Slick Rick and all those guys who used to wear huge jewellery.","We don't have a jewellery background, so we just come up with these things that we wanna wear, that we wish were out there, you know?","There's nothing new under the sun, right? I think the most modern thing you can do with designing is just taking something that's existing and introducing it in a way that hasn't been done.","I just use intuition - would I wear that? Would it feel okay? It's pretty simple, nothing too complicated.","I grew up in the Seattle suburbs - the suburbs of suburbs. Where I'm from, it's super quiet, just woods and nothing.","For me, I like to look presentable when I'm outside. I'm not going to come to the office with nasty hair and pajamas just because I stayed up all night - that's just who I am.","What I find kind of annoying as a woman, especially in this society, is how people like to support people who seem like they're struggling when it comes to artists."],"Yoshihiko Noda":["Japan is already a leader in energy efficiency, and it has a wealth of innovative technologies. We must put this expertise to use creating a model for growth and sustainability that we can share with the world.","When I became prime minister last September, I promised the Japanese people that I would not tolerate the politics of indecision. A propensity to delay difficult and weighty decisions has been hurting our country. It is detrimental to our economy, society and future, and it cannot be allowed to continue.","A loach can't emulate a goldfish. Because of my looks, the public support rating for us won't rise.","A society of 'children first' is a society that nurtures smiling faces in everyone.","I am not a hereditary politician and do not have any substantial asset.","The greatest problem in Japanese politics over the last two decades is that we put off what needed to be done. We have to overcome that.","Japan's alliance with the U.S. will only grow in importance amid the increasingly difficult security situation surrounding our country, thus I think it is necessary to keep the marines in Okinawa, a geographically strategic location from the standpoint of maintaining deterrence.","I hope to attend it as Japan needs to tell the world the lessons, knowledge and reflections learned from the nuclear crisis at the Fukushima No. 1 power plant.","The real reform Japan needs is decisive politics when we face issues that need to be decided.","China should be developing through the various foreign investments it receives. I hope for its level-headed and rational understanding that anything to discourage that is a disservice to itself.","Japan is the largest creditor country in the world, so we have made contributions to the stability of international markets and we want this IMF meeting to confirm that we will continue to contribute.","There's a tendency for the yen to strengthen because it's rated highly, but I don't think that accurately reflects Japan's economic performance.","Government bonds have basically been sold in the domestic market, so there is some sense of stability, but the amount of public debt is really severe... Japan must manage its finances with a sense of urgency.","It is my policy to deepen the Japan-U.S. alliance and to deepen security and economic relations as well as personal exchanges.","It is not productive to see things in simple black and white, and talk in either anti-nuclear or pro-nuclear terms.","With regard to North Korea, between myself and President Obama earlier, with regard to the so-called launch of satellite, the missile launch, we shared the view that it undermines the efforts of the various countries concerned to achieve the resolution through dialogue.","I think the forms of terrorism are becoming very diverse, amongst them cyber-terrorism, for example.","China's development is an opportunity for the international community, for Japan and for the Asia-Pacific.","I feel very keenly the eyes of the foreign media on our country. And I think a lot of Japanese people feel that things are not working the way they should. When the time comes, I will put myself forward.","I think it is not necessary at this time to put forth a grand vision such as an East Asian Community. What we must do before that is create scenarios for Japan's response in case of a serious territorial incident.","Interactions between fathers and children are the starting point of education.","We must draw on the unique strengths of the Japanese economy, seek an open and cooperative approach with our international partners, and intelligently exploit the promise of new growth areas.","Our goal is not simply to reconstruct the Japan that existed before March 11, 2011, but to build a new Japan. We are determined to overcome this historic challenge."],"Yoshio Taniguchi":["Architecture is basically a container of something. I hope they will enjoy not so much the teacup, but the tea.","When a project has an ample budget, I am interested now in using bigger units of materials.","When drawings of the main buildings I have designed in the last five years are juxtaposed, the fact that they all involve the pursuit of certain configurations is obvious to anyone."],"Yoshiro Mori":["India and Japan should develop a complementary relationship in information technology.","A vote for Japan is a vote for the future of rugby. We will do our best to make rugby a global sport.","It is my strong hope that an environment will be created in which both of our countries can cooperate for the realization of a world without nuclear weapons.","Japan is the only country in the world which suffered from the scourge of nuclear weapons."],"Yossi Sarid":["There are no good and bad peoples; there are only leaderships that behave responsibly or insanely.","Nazism promoted Germany from a low to a fantastic physical and ideological status.","Not only are Feiglin's people radicals and fascists but also the bearers of severe personal disturbances, which hide behind a layer of patriotic make-up under the camouflage of the Jewish faith.","If the Knesset is a temple, then Feiglin is the idol. A Knesset where Feiglin presides is an impure Knesset.","I do not believe in the eternity of the spirit. That contradicts my ideology.","I believe in something that maybe can be defined as the God in one's heart, in the heart of every human being, but not in a God who sits on high looking down on us and taking care of us and whom we bother with things trivial and weighty so that he will be good to us and arrange things for us here.","I was involved in legislating dozens of laws, perhaps hundreds. But my glory didn't lie in legislative work, if there is any glory in it. The Israeli law books are full of laws that aren't enforced anyway.","It's not up to me to list, like a grocer, my achievements in the government and the Knesset.","The fight against terror cannot stop as long as terrorism itself is not stopped, but the path of war must change: it must lead directly to terrorists and not be waged on the backs of three million Palestinians.","I made a name for myself as someone who is determined to swim against the stream if it's dirty.","Young people who have no future will easily give up their future, which they can't see on the horizon.","I hate all the terrorists in the world, whatever the purpose of their struggle. However, I support every active civil revolt against any occupation, and Israel, too, is among the despicable occupiers. Such revolt is both more just and more effective, and it does not extinguish one's spark of humanity."],"Yossi Vardi":["If you are afraid to fail, then you should go and become a banker.","If someone has failed, that is not a deficiency for me. I think that he has more motivation. I've seen many examples where someone was successful first and failed later and failed first and then succeeded. If they failed in an honest way, I don't see it as a deficiency.","In the end, I think that people that are not willing to take the risk to fail are not true entrepreneurs."],"Yotam Ottolenghi":["Pasta with melted cheese is the one thing I could eat over and over again.","A well-made salad must have a certain uniformity; it should make perfect sense for those ingredients to share a bowl.","The way to entice people into cooking is to cook delicious things.","On many occasions, an informal buffet and casual seating offer a little more intimacy than a loud gathering around a big table.","You can really taste the difference between a shop-bought and a good homemade mayo.","I am sure that in the story of Adam and Eve, the forbidden fruit was a fig and not an apple, pear or anything else.","I like to add something unusual to a dish.","If I must choose between healthy and tasty, I go for the second: having only one life to waste, it might as well be a pleasurable one.","The differences between a tart, a pie and a quiche are a blur.","The most important thing for me is to walk the little alleys of the city, to find the little alcove where someone is cooking something, and just watch them do it. That's my idea of fun.","Good-quality nuts, toasted in a little butter and salt, make a magical addition to many salads.","Almost every culture has its own variation on chicken soup, and rightly so - it's one of the most gratifying dishes on the face of the Earth.","The combination of olive oil, garlic and lemon juice lifts the spirits in winter.","Orange blossom water would make a magical addition to your store cupboard.","I get great pleasure from stuffed foods, from an apple strudel to a vegetable samosa, from a whole roasted bird with a sweet and savoury stuffing to a vine leaf filled with rice and spices.","For me, the end of childhood came when the number of candles on my birthday cake no longer reflected my age, around 19 or 20. From then on, each candle came to represent an entire decade.","Herbs deserve to be used much more liberally.","Middle Eastern cuisine has the same depth of ingredients and processes as other cuisines. They just haven't had as much exposure.","Sweet potatoes are ideal for lazy days: just bake, then mash and mix with yogurt, butter or olive oil.","Food can bring people together in a way nothing else could.","Good asparagus needs minimal treatment and is best eaten with few other ingredients.","I'm a firm believer that the world should be your oyster when you're cooking. People should open themselves to other cuisines - there are a lot of hidden secrets all over the world.","I have yet to meet a carnivore who doesn't love a sausage roll.","There is a unique freshness when eating buckwheat noodles cold with plenty of herbs and citrus acidity. I can't think of any better use of chopsticks on a hot and sweaty evening.","The taste of any simple tomato-based salad is dependent on the quality of the tomatoes.","One man's trash is another man's treasure, and the by-product from one food can be perfect for making another.","The range of ingredients available to home cooks has expanded dramatically.

I love them with chopped walnuts or almonds, lemon juice, garlic, herbs and plenty of olive oil.","I used to have a very unmediated experience of food but, because of the recipe testing, I've lost that now. I can't switch it off even when I'm on holiday.","Having grown up in the Middle East, eating beans for breakfast always seemed like a bizarre British eccentricity.","Custard is controversial: what makes it a custard, how best to cook it and, crucially, is it to be eaten or put in a pie and thrown?","A great fig should look like it's just about to burst its skin. When squeezed lightly it should give a little and not spring back. It must be almost unctuously sweet, soft and wet.","The difference between a bland tomato and great one is immense, much like the difference between a standard, sliced white bread and a crusty, aromatic sourdough.","The main distinction for fresh chillies is whether they are red or green, the difference being one of ripeness.","Tel Aviv is the most exciting place to eat in Israel.","There is nothing like a good old recipe.

No, that's not an overstatement.","On some subconscious level, I've been prejudiced against turnips, parsnips, swedes and other roots. Do they taste of much? Are they really special? How wrong I was.","As is always the way with pancakes, the first hotcake to come out of the pan will probably be a bit misshapen. Just scoff it, and carry on with the rest.","Barley and mushroom is a soothing combination. It's mainly a textural thing, with the barley both gently breaking and enhancing the mushroomy gloopiness.","Chipotles, which are dried jalapeno peppers, give out a terrific smoky flavour - they're warm, earthy and usually not too spicy.","You don't need a machine to make pasta: a rolling pin and a fast hand can create a smooth, if thick, sheet.","Swiss chard is undervalued in Britain. It's a great substitute for spinach and keeps its shape well.","Manouri is a Greek ewes' milk cheese that's light in colour and texture. It's fresh and milky, and goes well with other subtle flavours.","Popping broad beans out of their skins can be therapeutic, but it isn't everybody's favourite waste of time.","Speaking as someone who didn't go through the U.K. school system, with all the culinary baggage that entails, I am inordinately fond of custard in any shape or form.","If the British Isles had an official vegetable, it would have to be the potato.","I don't do guilt. Whatever I do, I do it happily.","I just don't tend to cook eggplant at home.","People don't know how good cauliflower is, because they always have this image of cauliflower cheese - awful, sticky, creamy and rich.","Pizza was made for television in so many ways: it is easy to heat up, easy to divide and easy to eat in a group. It is easy to enjoy, easy to digest and easy-going. It is so Italian!","The emotive power of hummus all over the Middle East cannot be overstated, being the focus of some serious tribal rivalries.","Brussels sprouts are really quite versatile.","Yoghurt cuts sweetness and richness, tempers spice, and makes a dish sing.","Every era has its own list of ingredients that are considered exotic and then, 15 years later, they're not.","Fish cakes are perceived as being quite British, and they're always a bit brown and a little dull.","You can be vegetarian and eat fish. It's your choice, just say: 'I am what I am.' There are no hardcore divisions anymore.","My dad makes food with very few delicate flavours.","Dad likes my food, but he probably thinks it's too busy. He is a wonderful cook but only uses three ingredients. My mum rips out my articles and makes my recipes.","I can't stand recipes that don't have background.","My maternal grandmother made fantastic ox tongue with velvety roasted potatoes. She cooked sweet red cabbage and lovely cauliflower with butter and bread crumbs.","If I am honest, my food is actually quite far removed from both the food of my mother and my father.","I enjoy meat, but I can do without it.","Even in the busiest kitchen, there's always a point at the end of the day when you go home.","The kitchen is tough. It's one of the last bastions in civilized culture that sets out to crush the spirit.","In certain European cuisines, vegetables are cooked a long time. I take the term 'al dente' and use it for vegetables.","I have an intense dislike of doctrines, because you will always end up eating your words.","Too many books are full of recipes that aren't doable at home. They are purely aspirational. They are quite frightening, even for me.","I do support people eating more vegetables. It's a good thing to do.","I like to talk about food, ingredients, and how to adapt recipes. It's a dialogue.","Healthy is in the eye of the beholder.","Eating ready-made meals is about being very passive, and actively cooking is something that nothing compares to.","The teaching thing, the one where I have to impart my knowledge, is probably what comes the least naturally to me because I'm an absorber of things.","If you can't taste an ingredient, you have to ask yourself why it is there.","There used to be a time - it isn't so much the case now - that vegetarianism was some kind of religion, and either you belong or you don't belong.","Stereotypical vegetarian food looks gray and brown.","In vast parts of the world, people don't eat meat.","Conflict is very much a state of mind. If you're not in that state of mind, it doesn't bother you.","Food was always important in my family, but I didn't think of it as a vocation until a later point in life.","There are tons of wonderful places to eat in London.","These days, meals are more open to personal preferences. People like to serve themselves.","When I was a kid, there was always food to be had on the street in Jerusalem, but anything above a falafel stand was mediocre or worse.","When I cook a meal, I like to serve things one by one and keep them separate. I get that from my father - he's such a purist. Some people even put their desserts on the main plate. It's just wrong.","Most men say they can cook pasta, but I think you should find a little bit of an unusual angle on your pasta and make that your signature dish.","One of the troubles with food is that people take themselves too seriously. This is why I'm very happy for people to change my recipes, alter them, replace one ingredient for another.","The Guardian's 'Word of Mouth' blog bridges the gap between blogging and serious food journalism.","Fusion food as a concept is kind of trying to quite consciously fuse things that are sometimes quite contradictory, sometimes quite far apart, to see if they'd work.","Some breakfast cereals only come into their own as children's party treats: what are cornflakes and Coco Pops for, if not to clump together with melted chocolate and spoon into a cupcake holder?","Way back when I was a junior pastry chef, I'd bake loads of muffins every morning, as many as 120 or so, while operating on autopilot.","When it comes to the battle of the molluscs, cephalopods win tentacles down.","Most fish require a short cooking time, but cephalopods are the exception to this fishy rule.

Not good.","What makes maftoul worth celebrating is that it's so easy and forgiving to cook.","There are many reasons I feel at home in the U.K., but if I were asked to pinpoint the moment I knew I'd arrived, it might well be when I realised the British shared my love of fritters.","As for pineapple, it's far more versatile than you might think, and certainly merits wider use than in Hawaiian pizzas and pina coladas and on cheesy cocktail sticks.","Going out for a meal, especially for young urbanites, is less about socialising over enjoyable food than about enjoying food as a way to socialise.","Lebanese mezze, Cantonese dim sum and Basque pinchos have all evolved over years and are designed to make sense together.","Long-, medium- and short-grain rices differ in the amount and type of starch they have.","The difference between brown and white rice is that the former is not milled. With the outer bran and germ intact, the rice is therefore chewier and nuttier.","Buckwheat, like Marmite and durian, is a seriously divisive foodstuff, so it needs a seriously capable defence team if it's ever going to make it on to most people's dinner tables.","Though not a true cereal but a fruit, buckwheat seeds resemble cereal grains and are often used in a similar way to rice, barley, bulgar or quinoa, usually as a side dish.","Verjuice may not be the easiest thing in the world to find, but you should be able to track some down in good delis and online.","Many ingredients are called 'earthy,' but none comes as close to fitting the bill as buckwheat. I'm mildly obsessed with the stuff.","It's well worth making your own harissa, but there are some very good commercial varieties.","Tiny quails may not seem as impressive as a mammoth turkey, but there is something refreshing about a spread of individual birds on the Christmas table.","Sea spaghetti looks like dark fettuccine and has a similar texture - you can get it in health food stores or online.","My secret with kale is to add lots of sweet or sharp flavours to offset some of that grassy intensity.","The combination of lentils with rice or bulgur is the absolute height of Levantine comfort food. I could eat it every day.","I rarely cook traditional risotto, but I love other grains cooked similarly - barley, spelt or split wheat. I find they have more character than rice and absorb other flavours more wholeheartedly.","Poaching white fish in moderately hot oil guarantees soft-textured flesh and allows you to prepare a sauce calmly, without the usual panic about overcooking the fish.","Steaming maintains some of the aubergine flesh's texture, which doesn't happen if you cook it in any other way.","I adore recipes that make use of one cut of meat or a whole animal to create a complex dish, loaded with flavour.","Chinese sausage, which is widely available from Asian grocers and online, is sweet, rich, and enticingly smoky. I add it to steamed rice with strips of omelette and a few baby veg stir-fried with soy.","New-season lamb shoulder, cooked pink, is the perfect platform for a mixture of fresh and cooked herbs.","I love dishes that feature the various shades of a single colour, making you stop to check what's in there.","Urfa chillies are a Turkish variety that are mild on heat but big on aroma. They're sweet, smoky, a lovely dark red, and go with just about anything.","Salbitxada is a sharp and lightly sweet Catalan sauce that's traditionally served with calcots - spring or salad onions, grilled whole, make a good substitute.","Celery leaves are an underused ingredient, most likely because supermarkets sell mostly leafless stalks.","Braising eggs in a flavoursome, aromatic sauce is all the rage. It is warming and comforting, ideal for the morning when you are not normally up for a great culinary challenge.","Miso makes a soup loaded with flavour that saves you the hassle of making stock.","Some heat, some spice and plenty of citrus are the building blocks of many North African fish dishes.","I have a terrible tendency to lick my fingers when I cook. So much so that I got a telling off from my pastry teacher years ago, who said it would hinder my prospects.","After all these years of cooking and writing recipes, I am still amazed every time I notice how even the minutest of variation in technique can make a spectacular difference.","I've been accused of having very long ingredient lists, and I guess there's some truth in that.","Forget mung beans' reputation as healthy yet bland - used right, they soak up loads of flavour.","I have been cooking with preserved lemon for years, using it left, right and centre, but I am still far from reaching my limit.","Date syrup is a natural sweetener that has wonderful richness and treacly depth; I drizzle it over semolina porridge.","Tossing doughnuts, fritters or fried dumplings in fennel sugar adds grown-up complexity without diminishing the indulgence factor.","I always preferred my father's pasta the next day, when he'd put it in a hot oven with heaps of extra cheese. It would emerge slightly burned and very crisp on top.","Chefs don't use white pepper just to avoid spoiling the whiteness of pommes puree or bechamel. It has a more peppery aroma, with sharpness and sweetness, too.","A great ratatouille is one in which the vegetables interact with each other but are still discernible from each other. The trick is to cook them just right: not over, not under.","Marinating chicken in miso adds lots of character to the meat with little work.","Sorrel adds a unique grassy sharpness to salads and dressings, but it can be hard to come by.","Kibbeh comes in all forms, but most feature bulgur and meat.","Leeks are normally given the job of flavouring other things, such as stocks and soups, but I find their creaminess and sweet, oniony flavour very satisfying.","It's hard to beat the rough texture of steel-cut oats, with their slight resistance against the teeth.","Agave nectar is a good substitute for refined sugars. It has a relatively low glycaemic index, which means it doesn't cause quick rises in blood sugar levels. It also has a nice, mild flavour.","Breakfast is always the best time for something juicy, sweet and fresh - it just feels like the right way to open the day. There's no right way, though, when it comes to choosing the fruit.","Normally, when congee is served, the different condiments and garnishes are placed in little bowls on the side so diners can make their own personal creations.","Barberries, or zereshk, are tiny dried red fruit with a tremendously sharp flavour. They come from Iran, where they're used to add freshness to rice and chicken dishes.","Mackerel is sustainable and healthy.","Apart from its famous healing properties, manuka has a strong, woody flavour.","Many people struggle to make hummus that lives up to their expectations at home, and recreating a favourite brand or the stuff from your local deli is almost impossible.","Gooseberries aren't just for creamy desserts and pies.","Chermoula is a potent North African spice paste that is ideal for smearing on your favourite vegetables for roasting.","The smells of slow cooking spread around the house and impart a unique warmth matched only by the flavour of the food.","A lemon, boiled whole and blitzed, makes a useful base for all sorts of dressings.","I always pan-fry sprouts - it retains texture and enhances flavour."],"Young Buck":["Everybody was in struggle, in the grind trying to make it.","I came back to the hood and got in those streets and started doing whatever it took for me to provide.","I want the world to get a feel of me, showing them the way I am and the way I get down.","I been doing music my whole life.","I started rapping when I was about 12 or 13, just playing around with it.","Around the age of 14, 15, I was in the studio, serious about it.","There's really no age limit when you out there in those streets.","I was young and felt like it was opportunity 'cause they were moving units back then on the underground scene.","I felt like if I wasn't around, maybe my shot would be gone.","The people I used to have around me from Nashville was showing love to the Cash Money clique on the strength of Buck trying to make it; making sure Buck gets to where he gots to go.","I was young and so eager to make some money as well as get exposed and show my talent.","It was like an honor thing for me to meet 50 cause I respected his whole story.","With me being form the South, I wanted to make this album like a G Unit.","You won't really get a lot of the mainstream, lovey-dovey side because that wasn't a part of my life in the beginning."],"Young Jeezy":["I just think a hustler's ambition is that I never stop. I start off hustling and said I'll never stop hustling. An ambitious hustler is the one to hustle the hustlers. When I grew up, my heroes were hustlers. Now I'm their hero.","My hustle is nonstop. I never stop hustling.","You gotta have life your way. If you ain't losing your mind, you ain't partying right.","I never ever paid attention to any election.","In my heart, I'm 100% real. You can't pull out nothing in my past that can say I'm not 100% real.","Everyday, all day I have to be productive. And when I ain't productive, I get concerned.","As long as I'm not selling out the people that ride or die with me, I'm glad I'm not an MC. I'm a motivational speaker. I'm not that rapper dude.","When you a ghetto star, when you a hood star, you gonna take care of your grandmother, your mother. When you on that next level, you gotta take care of the city, the streets.","I created my lane. No one can ever run my lane because it's mine. I'm the Michael Jackson of my lane. And you know, nobody was as great as Michael. I love Prince, but he's not Michael.","Anybody that's got a problem with me is probably envious or wants to be me, and that's how I've always looked at it.","I think I got a lot of life skills; I got a lot of wisdom; I've seen a lot of bad things happen to a lot of good people.","I could sit right here and have a 15-minute conversation with somebody and change their whole life.","Anything that looks good makes you feel better.","I'm a motivational speaker.","When you're trying to bring the streets into rap to prove a point, then you already lost. You separate the two, and that ain't to be played with. You've got people that lost their lives and people that are doing real time. If we gon' make music, let's just make music.","I think everybody knows my sound because I'm me, you know? But, on your fourth album, I think you've definitely gotta show growth because I definitely don't plan on being one of those cats that fade off. It's always about growing with me; I grew up over the years.","I guess now music is so saturated and so microwaved. It's, like, 15 minutes in the microwave and boom, you've got something. Nobody's putting passion or any thought behind it anymore.","I, and others like me - trap stars - we always considered ourselves Robin Hoods: we go out and get the money. Just think, if you was in the village and you a hunter, you take pride in going out to hunt the prey and bring it back for the village to eat. In our situation, we took pride in getting money so that the hood could eat.","I never wanted to be a statistic. I never wanted to be that cat who tried and never made it.","People who work every day are kind of scared of things they don't understand.","I love the streets, and the streets love me back. And when things ain't going the way they should go, they let you know... and when they happy, you gotta keep 'em happy.","I've got to pay $5 for gas just like everybody else.","Honestly, I'm on the road so much that I never really get a chance to go to baseball games.","To be honest, I think about the clubs when I write. But I should probably start thinking about stadiums, because the songs sound even better there - and bigger.","It's not the average people that come to my show.","A lot of things come with fame, whether it's losing friends or losing family.","With rap, it's a funny thing. You can say things, and people can take 'em the way they wanna take 'em.","Music is how you feel.","In middle school, I had an '87 Regal. That was unheard of.","I don't know how to be a rapper. I just know how to be me.","You seen my shows; I bring the 'hood out.","This rap game is just WWF; everybody wants points off somebody else.","I'ma continue to make records, continue to make hits, continue to be what I am, legendary.","John McCain... looks like a fraud to me.","My fans are my family, because they understand me and I understand them.","Music is all about leadership and there ain't really a lot of leaders.","Politics isn't only about government. Politics is about the people.","Sam Jackson is like the Jeezy of Hollywood: He's for his people.","When money was plentiful, I was the first one who told you to stack it. Live your life with it. Now that money slowed up, I'ma be the one telling you to save it like they ain't gon' make it no more.","I represent the Democratic party... I've never been nor do I ever plan to be a John McCain supporter. I support Barack Obama.","I don't really feel McCain. It ain't just because Barack is black; he can make change. Just like Bush equals recession, Barack equals progression.","I feel like I'm married to what I do, to the streets. And I feel like when the streets are mad, it's serious.","I don't think nobody should compare me to anyone, 'cause, at the end of the day, you've got a 'Pac, you've got Snoop, you got Tip, you got Wayne - there's only one Jeezy, man. Ain't nobody walked in these shoes but me.","All my music is inspirational. You just gotta listen to the words and get what you can get out of it."],"Young Thug":["We need money. We need hits. Hits bring money, money bring power, power bring fame, fame change the game.","In my world, of course, it don't matter.

So I got rid of the phone to focus.","When it comes to swag, there's no gender involved.","Wayne and Drake, it takes them so long to do a song. I understand why, because they want it to be perfect.

But I want to be rich forever.","It's like, boom! - I've got a girlfriend. It turned out to be a good thing because it made me a rapper.","I've got a condo in Miami, but I don't live in it.","My dad wouldn't buy me tight pants. I had to get my own money to buy them.","He's so sophisticated... Kanye is like 'Fifty Shades of Grey,' he's interesting, so you want to be around him.","I always paid attention to Lil Wayne - close attention. He's my idol. He's still my idol.","If I didn't have a girlfriend, I'd have 10 girls at the studio, and they would make me not rap.","I've always been a sharing person.","I ain't want my kids to grow up and call me Thug. I don't want anybody to kind of look at me like that. So I'm gonna just use my real name.","I stayed in the ghetto. Then I stayed in condos, then I stayed in penthouses, and then I stayed in mansions.","I like everything that people say. No matter what they say. You gay, you a punk.

My dad would whoop me: 'You're not going to school now, you'll embarrass us!'","Atlanta is the number one place to live.

I wake up and think, 'I want to buy a car', I buy a car. I wake up and be like, 'I just want to lay in bed with my girl', I do that. I wake up and want to rap, I rap. So whatever I think of.","I want every Grammy.","Anyone can rap if you've got brains. So I just went with it.","I only listen to Lil Wayne.","My dad wanted me to play football so bad, he took me to Washington High School on the west side of Atlanta because they were number one. They never lost.","I did a song in eight minutes. I thought everybody could write songs that fast. But working with a lot of them, they don't.","I didn't used to do shows, because I used to be so shy. We'd perform, and I'd be at the back, thinking of another song. I was so shy, I ain't never getting in front of the camera; I would never get on stage.","I can't remember 16 bars. Unless you write it, you can't.

I want to always be all right. But motivation is fans - not your kids, your mum, none of that. All of that matters, but number one is your fans.","I don't do my own Instagram.","If you feel that you can just come in the studio and freestyle on my song, then I'm ready to rap battle you.

Music in Senegal, and Africa, is never music for music's sake or solely for entertainment. It's always a vehicle for social connections, discussions and ideas.","In the West, you have always associated the Islamic faith 100 percent with Arab culture. This in itself is a fundamentalist attitude and it is mistaken.","I think people should know more of Africa in terms of its joie de vivre, its feeling for life. In spite of the images that one knows about Africa - the economic poverty, the corruption - there's a joy to living and a happiness in community, living together, in community life, which may be missing here in America.","Islam has been badly used by a certain ideology.","I'm a modern Muslim. I pray, and if I have a question, I ask someone who is more educated in the religion than me.","If you come from Africa with your economic poverty and your cultural riches, and you meet someone like Peter Gabriel or a person from a big record company, and they tell you that what you are doing is marvelous, that makes you feel powerful.","I have to protect my family and have a life with them that is completely private.","I respect music, I do.

And the sad thing is that the elites are just not interested in the welfare of the people.","Africa is the future.","Music is a language.","I think that Sufism fits all over the world. The concept is not anything that fits standard Western ideas - it's always related to culture, to music, to religion. It is a dominant religion in Senegal.","I have studied at the school of the world.","Travel teaches as much as books.","I want to use my music to deliver a political message and sometimes to denounce, but I don't want to be a politician.","Politics is politics; art is art. If you play a political role, you have to stop being an artist.","I don't really see myself as an actor.","I love meeting interesting people and doing things with them.","In politics, sometimes you have to lie, or you make a promise that you cannot keep.","When the slaves left Africa, they left us this music. They left us blues.","I really want to bring the message of love that is Islam to people; bring something new to that familiar face.","Western record companies haven't always dealt with African musicians in the best way. Giving them a lot of money and telling them they're going to be bigger than Phil Collins is the wrong way to do it!","When I'm in Senegal, I can't just sit in isolation making music. People need my help. And the Senegalese people helped create my music. It comes from the country itself.","My father used to tell me about how musicians don't have respect from people and he was afraid about my future.","The question of modernization is central to disturbances in the Middle East and in Africa. Everyone is after modernization, no matter where they come from. But you have to be careful about it, and more importantly, you have to have sense about it.","My music is like a spinning ball. It can turn in one direction, and then it comes back to origins.","Islam is a peaceful religion.","Listen, a lot of religions have fundamentalists.","I grew up with reggae music."],"Yousuf Karsh":["Look and think before opening the shutter. The heart and mind are the true lens of the camera.","Character, like a photograph, develops in darkness.","I've also seen that great men are often lonely. This is understandable, because they have built such high standards for themselves that they often feel alone. But that same loneliness is part of their ability to create.","There is a brief moment when all there is in a man's mind and soul and spirit is reflected through his eyes, his hands, his attitude. This is the moment to record.","Within every man and woman a secret is hidden, and as a photographer it is my task to reveal it if I can.","If there is a single quality that is shared by all great men, it is vanity.","The trouble with photographing beautiful women is that you never get into the dark room until after they've gone."],"Yoweri Museveni":["May the soul of the late President Milton Obote... a long-time member of this parliament, rest in peace.","I've never heard an agency say, 'Unless you industrialize I will not support you'.","What is the Geneva Convention on wars! I have never read it.","None of the parties want this conflict to go on.","We used to fight the LRA with only one dimensional force that only walks on foot, but now, we have got multiple forces to fight the rebels."],"Yu Chui Yee":["I think the most important thing for your life is the way you interpret things. Having an optimistic point of view is so important - your life will be so bright.","Whenever I see the Hong Kong flag is flying in the sky, not because of anybody else, because of my efforts, I think it's the most proud time of my life.","I am so proud of being a Paralympian because I think the Games are a very good platform for disabled persons to perform themselves. Within the Paralympics movement, it's not just talk about excellence; it's not just talk about the competition. It's also talk about the equality and how your world accepts those disabled people.","When I had bone cancer, I was just 11 years old. I think my parents suffered a lot because they worried about my health, my life, so much. For me, it was quite bad feeling during the treatment. But I quite enjoyed staying in the hospital because so many kids played with me."],"Yuan T. Lee":["We need to become good citizens in the global village, instead of competing. What are we competing for - to drive more cars, eat more steaks? That will destroy the world.","Because of recent improvements in the accuracy of theoretical predictions based on large scale ab initio quantum mechanical calculations, meaningful comparisons between theoretical and experimental findings have become possible.","It's very satisfying to promote science and education and see good results. Setting a good example for young people, being a role model, is very important for me.","Through the continued accumulation of detailed and reliable knowledge about elementary reactions, we will be in a better position to understand, predict and control many time-dependent macroscopic chemical processes which are important in nature or to human society.","Molecular collision dynamics has been a wonderful area of research for all practitioners. This is especially true for those who were following the footsteps of pioneers and leaders of the field twenty years ago."],"Yuan Yuan Tan":["I like walking in Golden Gate Park.","For me, dance is about the aesthetics and the hard work that goes into creating something so beautiful. Motivation and dedication to the craft is what pushes me to do my best, to always strive to do better, and the outcome is always worth it.","I love to watch old movies when I get time off.","I have never gotten my nails done.","I can let go of a lot of stuff, but I focus on things I think I should, like dancing, because it takes 100 percent concentration on every step.","Things don't always happen the way one wishes they would.","If Shanghai wants to be an international cultural center, they have to do something about that. The reason I left is that I wanted to explore what ballet is all about, and if I had stayed put, that wouldn't have happened.","My Chinese side comes out in my dancing. There's a certain in-the-moment sentimentality, an appreciation for the smallest details.","I love wine tasting in Napa. I don't have a huge collection, but the bottles I do have are special.","I own the complete DVD set of all the Audrey Hepburn movies ever made.","I remember watching Audrey Hepburn dancing in movies, and I was inspired by how graceful she looked, though I understand it was no easy task.","I think Hong Kong's ballet audience is very sophisticated in the sense that they are able to find the beauty in good performances.","I think ballet has influenced my personality a lot in the sense that I am very disciplined in all of my endeavours. I am always on time; I take things very seriously. I've built up my inner strength and self-esteem over time as I've improved as a dancer.","My favorite shoe brand is Christian Louboutin - I don't have a favorite shoe store per se.","My workout is ballet class and rehearsal - I've never belonged to a gym.","I can be very hard on myself, very demanding.","I'm flying all around the world, and it's hard to be settled.","I have learned to be patient.","I just don't do much social media. No, it is more important to strike a balance between ballet and real life."],"Yuichiro Miura":["I want to ski down Mount Cho Oyu in the Himalayas when I am 85, descending from a height of 8,201 meters.","It's important to have a dream no matter how old you are.","I never imagined I could make it to the top of Mount Everest at age 80. This is the world's best feeling, although I'm totally exhausted. Even at 80, I can still do quite well.","Just keep challenging yourself. I think that's a great thing.","When I planned to ski Everest, the first thing I faced was, 'How can I return alive?' All the preparation and training was based on this question. But the more I prepared, I knew the chance of survival was very slim. Nobody in the world had done this before, so I told myself that I must face death. Otherwise, I am not eligible.","If the limit of age 80 is at the summit of Mt Everest, the highest place on Earth, one can never be happier.","I've learned through my own experiences that working toward an objective in your life can change who you are.","It's important to set your own goals and work hard to achieve them.","I've been doing extremely dangerous activities for a long time, but I've been lucky enough to have survived so far. However, sooner or later we all die... and, if that's the case, I want to die doing what I love to do the most. That's how I view death.","After retiring, I was a little bored with nothing to do and got fat. I thought, if a 60-year-old metabolic fat man, after five years, can get to Mount Everest, that would be very exciting."],"Yuji Horii":["When I started, people would come to interview me, and just knowing that I worked in videogames - it was like people wanted to stone me, it was that bad. People thought of video games as kind of a bad thing in society. Now, people that come to interview me, they have grown up with video games, and they know what they are; they've experienced it.","I wonder sometimes why the U.S. reviewers are more negative towards turn-based battle systems.","For 'Dragon Quest IX,' one of the biggest things was being able to create your own character and your party members, too. The importance of it is that you can customize the face, the name, or something like that, so the party members are really a reflection of you. It becomes more of your own experience.","For U.S. television series, I really like 'Dexter.'","In Japan, there's a TV series called Jin. It deals with time travel. I like stories about time travel. It's a story about people living in modern day that travel back to the Edo era. Those things really interest me.","Where 'Dragon Quest Monsters' originated from was 'Dragon Quest V,' where you had a monster befriending system as a main part: you could actually befriend monsters and have them fight on behalf of your party, as part of your party.","It is difficult to meet fan expectations, especially when people say, 'Oh, the last one was the best one.' It creates more pressure each time for the next game to top the last one."],"Yukihiro Matsumoto":["I believe consistency and orthogonality are tools of design, not the primary goal in design.","Most of the tasks we do are for humans. For example, a tax calculation is counting numbers so the government can pull money out from my wallet, but government consists of humans.","You want to enjoy life, don't you? If you get your job done quickly and your job is fun, that's good isn't it? That's the purpose of life, partly. Your life is better.","Actually, I didn't make the claim that Ruby follows the principle of least surprise. Someone felt the design of Ruby follows that philosophy, so they started saying that. I didn't bring that up, actually.","The orthogonal features, when combined, can explode into complexity.","I didn't work hard to make Ruby perfect for everyone, because you feel differently from me. No language can be perfect for everyone. I tried to make Ruby perfect for me, but maybe it's not perfect for you. The perfect language for Guido van Rossum is probably Python.","From the viewpoint of what you can do, therefore, languages do differ - but the differences are limited. For example, Python and Ruby provide almost the same power to the programmer.","Because of the Turing completeness theory, everything one Turing-complete language can do can theoretically be done by another Turing-complete language, but at a different cost. You can do everything in assembler, but no one wants to program in assembler anymore.","Ruby inherited the Perl philosophy of having more than one way to do the same thing. I inherited that philosophy from Larry Wall, who is my hero actually. I want to make Ruby users free. I want to give them the freedom to choose.","People are different. People choose different criteria. But if there is a better way among many alternatives, I want to encourage that way by making it comfortable. So that's what I've tried to do.","In our daily lives as programmers, we process text strings a lot. So I tried to work hard on text processing, namely the string class and regular expressions. Regular expressions are built into the language and are very tuned up for use."],"Yukio Mishima":["By means of microscopic observation and astronomical projection the lotus flower can become the foundation for an entire theory of the universe and an agent whereby we may perceive Truth.","At no time are we ever in such complete possession of a journey, down to its last nook and cranny, as when we are busy with preparations for it."],"Yukiya Amano":["Seen from the United States or Europe, Iran's nuclear program often causes most concern, but from the perspective of countries in the Asia-Pacific region, the North Korean program is equally worrying.","Satellite images suggest North Korea is building a light-water reactor and working on uranium enrichment. This is troubling.","The Iran nuclear issue is on top of the agenda. It is a very complicated issue with long history."],"Yul Brynner":["Girls have an unfair advantage over men: if they can't get what they want by being smart, they can get it by being dumb.","When I am dead and buried, on my tombstone I would like to have it written, 'I have arrived.' Because when you feel that you have arrived, you are dead.","I am just a nice, clean-cut Mongolian boy.","Because when you feel that you have arrived, you are dead.","I have been offered a lot for my work, but never everything.","Now that I'm gone, I tell you, don't smoke."],"Yul Vazquez":["The universe will put signposts in your life. You can either ignore them or embrace them. You can choose and wish for all the things you want, but the things that are coming to you, you will never be able to hide from and the things that you want so bad that are not supposed to be for you for whatever reason, they'll never come to you.","When you're onstage with Chris Rock, anything can happen. He is one of the greatest comic geniuses we've ever seen.","My wife and I volunteer for the Guide Dog Foundation, and we have two giant labs.","Led Zeppelin. Queen. Deep Purple. These were the bands I listened to. I still listen to them.","I was named after Yul Brynner because my mother had an infatuation with him. Who the hell names a Cuban kid Yul? Talk about a torturous childhood.","I'm not a role model. I say parents should parent and monitor their kids.","When I was a child it was very clear what I was allowed to see and what I was not allowed to see and there was no discussion or option or negotiation. Whatever my mom said, that's what went down.","You could go to Estonia and there's probably an episode of 'Seinfeld' playing there. Television is a very powerful thing.","I acted when I was a real little kid. My mother was an actress in a Miami theater company comprised of actors from Cuba like her and I was the default kid.","I was a late bloomer. I was a kinda shy little kid, definitely a child of the dark side. I wanted to play guitar and be in a rock band.","If I die tomorrow, I've done the two hardest things anybody can do in this life with the least amount of security - music and acting - and I've had success in both. I can't really complain. I try not to live my life that way.","You know, I've always tried to look at things as just what the part was. I never tried to worry about whether it was the lead or not the lead, because I think you can really mess your mind up when you're too caught up in those things.","It's funny, because I've never thought of myself as a Hispanic actor, like in 'American Gangster,' I'm playing an Italian. I've always been fortunate enough to have been allowed to play all these diverse roles.","My advice to young actors is probably to do some theatre; definitely do that. I keep running into these actors who have never been on stage, and it's invaluable for an actor. What you will learn about yourself is huge.","Yeah, I think that a play is a huge commitment, and I think that what it requires of you is a lot, so it really makes you dig in and find things, and it just makes you sharp, 'cause it's live. Really, to me, it separates the men from the boys. I always say it's like the frontlines of acting, when you're on stage."],"Yulia Tymoshenko":["I think women have to change their hairstyle from time to time.","I will get to the truth, if not in Ukrainian courts, then in international ones. I will fight to my last breath. They want to put me in prison but that won't help. My voice will be heard even louder from prison than now, and the whole world will hear me.","Whenever you see a successful woman, look out for three men who are going out of their way to try to block her.","The post-Soviet mafia wove a spider's web of dirty money around the world. Where better to attack it than to start with the Ukrainian criminal heavyweights - the 'family' and its closest circle?","I never complain. I chose the road of fighting with the Ukrainian oligarchy in 1996, and have paid for this with my freedom and that of my husband, my father and my close friends.","Yanukovych has changed everything in Ukrainian jails - real criminals have been released, while representatives of the middle class and politically rebellious free-minded people have filled the prisons.","Ukraine is a vital link for Europe: our energy transportation networks; our location between the European Union and Eurasia. We're the melting pot of Catholicism and Orthodox Christianity. The democracy we founded with the Orange Revolution has to be an example for other post-Soviet states.","My goal in politics from the very beginning has been, and will be, the goal of giving Ukraine a chance to finally secure a firm footing in the world as a competitive, independent and real European state.","I ask you, people who care about the soul of Ukraine, those who want to preserve the heart, the spirit and the faith of our country for future generations, to please defend it.","We will fight and defend my good name in the European court. We have to be strong and defend Ukraine from this authoritarianism.","I know the Russian political elite has got used to the Ukraine suffering from an inferiority complex, but I want this to disappear from our relationship.","I think everyone remembers how certain Russian bureaucrats used to work against the Ukrainian opposition; I think it is hard to drop old habits.","The old bastions of the post-communist regime collapsed before my very eyes. The monsters who had kept Ukraine in a criminal state left the stage.","I just heard the latest joke about my hair: 'Do you know what that is on her head? It's a steering wheel to drive the state.'","Everything that I have is natural - braid, nails - I practically never use cosmetics. They often ask me in the provinces about my braid."],"Yuliya Snigir":["I'm learning to be braver with colorful clothes, even if they're a little wild.","My dream was to play in good films, no matter in what country. I always waited for a decent script, and nothing has changed. I'm just sure that nothing in life is random, and I believe in the fate which guides you. Probably my starring in 'A Good Day to Die Hard' is good proof of that.","In American films, Russians are often portrayed like cartoon villains without clear motivations.","Thank God, I have sort of a pan-European accent rather than Russian, which doesn't sound very pleasantly to Americans. For them, we speak with a rather rude pitch, and that might be our actors' problem there. Now I've begun working with language coaches in Los Angeles to get rid of the accent completely.","I came to Los Angeles only after filming 'A Good Day to Die Hard,' when I was cast in the independent movie 'Delirium.' Director Lee Roy Kunz was looking everywhere for a Russian actress. He saw my photos, and only then he learned where I starred before! Eventually, I spent several months in the U.S., and we made the film quickly.","For me, it's very offensive when I notice that it's all about my appearance, how I look, that a man doesn't care who I am.","In chess, you should be as cool as a cucumber."],"Yuna":["The fashion world is so interesting because it's always changing, but if you know yourself really well, despite of all the changes in the fashion trends, you know how to stay true to yourself.","When I was younger I would go to the airport with my friends and drive out 2 A.M., 3 A.M. in the morning and just hang out until sunrise watching planes fly in and fly out. Just sit there and dream about how, one day, that's going to be us in those flights. We're gonna be one of those people with places to go.","I just realized the best way to live your life is to just be you, as cliche as it sounds. I grew up trying to please everyone.","Racism is everywhere - the older generations in Malaysia still say things like, 'She's darker-skinned; maybe don't marry her,' and it's very judgmental. A lot of girls do try to get fairness cream to lighten their skin, and I'm against all of that.","Whenever I Google for clothes, I always look at what Angelina Jolie is wearing. I love Sienna Miller, and I really like Rihanna's style, too. There's the edgy girl, classy girl, and the Bohemian chic girl. I guess I'm all of that combined into one.","I used to be affected by criticism thrown at me, and I would get really down. But I got to a point where I just decided to go for it, no matter what negativity is around you.","Eid is here! On the first day, it is a custom for all Malaysian Muslims to ask for forgiveness from our parents. We kiss their hands and wish them 'Selamat Hari Raya' or 'Eid Mubarak.' 'Maaf Zahir dan Batin' means 'to apologize in spirit and actions.'","Home, to me, is where I am and where I feel most comfortable. Obviously, Malaysia is home. In L.A., my home is my apartment because that's my Malaysia.","I love my headscarf. I wear my head wrap every day with my hoop earrings.","People think it's very strange because I love whale watching - you don't see whales a lot where I'm from.","My label understands that I am really attached to Malaysia, that I come home a lot.","'Material' is meant to be a fun, lighthearted song about the tiny bit of materialism that's in all of us. The message is meant to translate the notion that you don't need luxury items to feel special; you already are special.","I know how to wrap my turban a little better now. In the beginning, it was a little weird.","It's something that I do every year - every Ramadan to be exact - taking an 18-hour flight back home to Malaysia from Los Angeles. I'm born and raised in Malaysia, and Ramadan and Eid has always been my favorite time of the year.","I think you can soften people's hearts, even if they have a lot of hate. Music can do that if it's beautiful and honest. If I can do that - soften just one person's heart - I consider myself successful already.","I feel very honoured and humbled to have people think, 'If Yuna can break through, then why can't we?' It takes a lot of work, but I tell people to just have that focus. Always be humble and a learner, practice and do research.","I really like the idea of modesty. By the time I got into music, I was already wearing the scarf all the time, and it's really personal to me, my Muslim beliefs, so I decided to keep it and find a way to work around it. I don't see it as a restriction or limitation - I can still be me and get into music and be an entertainer.","To have a sense of style, it shows you know yourself. People like that.","In San Francisco, I eat halal, which is kind of like Muslim kosher, and there's this one Thai restaurant, and it's right next to the 'Great American Hall'. I'm there all the time whenever I'm in town; that's my spot.","I didn't take music seriously in the beginning. It just kind of a hobby to me. It was something that I love doing for fun.","The working environment in L.A. is really refreshing, really good. Because in Malaysia, it's a small country - you end up working with the same people that you like and that you know.","I have people who say, 'You should dress up like this, or you should dress more modest; you should cover up more.' And then, at the other end of the spectrum, you have, like, 'Why are you still wearing your scarf? You're in America, you know.'","I was truly honored to work with legendary DJ and producer DJ Premier. I still can't believe I have a track with Premier; it really is one of the best songs I've written in a long time.","I grew up listening to a lot of Malaysian pop music, which is kind of like a mixture of traditional and pop... I was also listening to a lot of English music as well.","I think I draw my inspiration from a lot of conversations that I had with people or my friends and combine them together with my own personal experience.","I really believed that my songs were good enough for the whole world to listen to. I had fans from America or the U.K. who would be like, 'Oh my God, I love your music'.","People say, 'You should let your hair out; you shouldn't be oppressed - you're not in Malaysia anymore. You should show your curves and be proud of it.' But I am proud - it's my choice to cover up my body. I'm not oppressed - I'm free.","I'm based here in L.A., but I think in the future I might consider settling down in Malaysia when I start a family.","Once in a while, I write in Malay and work on something fun that's more for the local Malaysian market, and when that happens, it's always something really special; it speaks volumes that I'm doing it for my fans who have been there for me since day one.","I grew up listening to a lot of different types of music, and R&B in particular was something that I loved - Aaliyah, Usher, Alicia Keys, TLC.","For 'Chapters', I decided to let go of my insecurities, found myself some talented R&B producers, and worked with them.","I'm a huge 'SK-II' person. I'm their Malaysian spokesperson. But I truly love their products - it's not just something that I endorse. I always moisturize with the SK-II Essential Power Rich Cream.","I always put on M.A.C. Prep and Primer before anything.","I use the 'Too Faced Chocolate Bar Eye Shadow' Palette every day. I've tried a bunch of stuff, but this is my favorite. For eyebrows, I use the 'Anastasia Beverly Hills Dipbrow' Pomade in Dark Brown, and for mascara, I don't use anything else but 'Urban Decay Perversion' Mascara.","I think when I first started out making music here in Los Angeles, a lot of people were really curious about my ethnicity, and you know, whatever questions they had, I'd be more than happy to answer them.","Just look at 'K-pop' - who would've expected American fans to embrace it? It's really cool to be one of those artists who can break through the American market. I'm not trying to conquer America; I just want to make music and see if people like it.","I feel like fashion and music relate to each other in a lot of ways. I always had to be creative: I'm a very creative person. I always liked making stuff. Apart from music, I always liked making clothes. You're able to express yourself.","Religion is a huge part of me; I'm a practicing Muslim. I'm pretty much open about it if people were to answer questions. At the end of the day, I'm just a normal girl. I have my own beliefs just like everyone else. I have a strong belief in something, but I also love music.","Being a musician, it's my job to be real and be true to whoever I am. Hopefully that will inspire other people. I hope it inspires people to be themselves and be comfortable in your own skin.","'Places to Go' is something that I would never normally write because I would usually be worried with what people would think about me.","Embrace the color of your skin and your own beauty.","I come from a jazzy, acoustic, folky background. Everything has to work with melodies; the words have to have meaning.","I have a lot of friends who do EDM music; they had to tell me what a 'drop' was.","I love Feist. I love Francoise Hardy. She was a French singer-songwriter in the '60s who was pretty huge. I think I'm drawn to her sincerity. I love Fiona Apple, too - she's quirky and really honest in her lyrics.","I think being bi-continental is something I want to continue. Kuala Lumpur is my home, but L.A. is where I've been able to make the music that I want.","I'm a Muslim. I don't try to hide it. I'm also a girl who loves music.","I kind of always struggled writing in Malay, because Malay is such a beautiful language. And it gets really hard, you know, if you want to make it into a song. You have to make it sound beautiful, use the right words.","Being in the spotlight, you know, you tend to kind of forget who you are. And being an artist... it could be a very superficial job. It could be very pretentious as well.","I was doing quite well in Malaysia... Everyone was so excited about my music, and they started accepting me as an artist.","The best thing to do when you're writing is to write about something you know instead of pretending. I mean, you can do that too, obviously, but when you write from your heart, it works so much better.","I think feminism is that you just have to stick it all out. I remember this one time when someone interviewed me, and I was young, and they said, 'Do you see yourself as a feminist?' And I was like, 'I don't know. I'm not really comfortable calling myself a feminist.'","I've always been singing all my life, but I started playing guitar when I was 19, and that was my final year in university, in law school. I think that happened when I started making a lot of friends who were in the independent music scene.","Whenever I write a new song, it always happens when I come back from Europe or Egypt or something like that. It's always from travelling.","When I got signed to the 'Fader' Label, they got really excited about having me as their new artist. They were promoting my music everywhere. Pharrell was one of the producers who wanted to work with me, so I was really lucky to be one of those people who got to work with him.","People pay attention to artists and celebrities, so they have the opportunity to do something great with this limelight. I, for one, have no problem with Kanye running for president, because if it's something that he truly believes in and it can lead to greater good, why not? I'm all for that.","Being a musician and artist can feel superficial at times - you talk about yourself every day and pose for photos for the magazines and newspapers, and it can be very tiring for your well-being.","I enjoy fashion and taking the effort to present myself well, and I'm glad that a lot of people refer to me as a 'Hijabster'. I'm not the greatest fan of the term, but I think girls everywhere should be confident in their own skin and be inspired to look and feel good inside and out.","A lot of people tend to go into the music industry and be really - what do you call it? - oblivious to everything that comes with it.","I came from a strong jazz/ singer-songwriter/folk influence, but in L.A., I learned how to have a balance between all these genres and R&B music and hip-hop, mixing them all together.","I like that I don't have to conform to the normal women-in-music-selling-sex-appeal thing.","A lot of the songs are based on my previous relationship. It didn't work out. I lost him, and it ruined me. I had to learn to get back on my feet. I used that heartbreak to create something really beautiful.","I want girls to know that equality exists in this world. You can do anything you want.","My style is all I have. When I go on stage, that's me in my comfort zone. It's not a costume. It's just me. And I want every woman to feel that way.","Fame is definitely a monster: it can suck you in and spit you out and change you. The biggest challenge is to remain yourself regardless of what people say about you.","If you just work on that one thing that's, like, important to you, that has been supportive of you, who has been loving you all this time, if you are able to see that, then that is your 'best love'.","I wasn't trained to be in front of a camera, so there were a lot of challenges at first. But I didn't want to be fake.","I try to look at people like Adele and Norah Jones, who are very successful but don't have to deal with scandals.","The first time I heard Adam Feeney and Chester Stone Hansen's 'Vibez,' it was used in Drake's '0-100' as a sample.","A lot of people think that because I'm from Malaysia, I'm driven by Malaysian sound, but actually, it's mostly just my melodies.","I guess music is very global.","I started singing very early. I was six or seven years old, and I was singing along to TV commercials and figuring out, 'Oh, hey, I can sing in tune. This is really cool.' But the songwriting thing came much much later, when I was 19 years old.","In Malaysia, we have a lot of divas, like Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey singers. And they were all so so talented, just very talented. For example, there's this one jazz singer, her name is Sheila Majid, and I was always singing her songs.","I didn't expect to have music as my main thing. I always thought I was going to be a lawyer. When I graduated, I was doing really well with my music in Malaysia. I had stable income, and I had really good momentum in the music industry, so I had to make a decision whether to stop that and continue being a lawyer.","Sometimes when you're a songwriter, you kind of have this egotistic thing: you just want to write something that you love, and you don't care about if people like it or not, but personally, I want to write something that people can jive to.","I've found just the right amount of balance in my life. I'm this pop artist in America, but I'm also Malaysian. And I'm also Muslim.","If I get to a place early in the morning, I try to walk around by myself. I still try to find cool places to go to, like a record store in St. Louis or some restaurant in Chicago.","I think, from the very beginning, I always knew that I needed to get out of Malaysia and do my thing somewhere else.","Being in the public eye, you can't really avoid a lot of questions. A lot of questions are being thrown at you, whether it's about your personal life or your personal beliefs, and I'm happy to answer them all.","I love traveling. I've been doing it since I was 16.","You learn so much about yourself as an artist. I never would have thought that I could sing every night, you know? Travel and perform every single night, and travel to another city the next day and do it all over again? You learn a lot of new things about yourself, and you make a lot of connections with people.","In my final year of law school, everything became real. Malaysian TV shows wanted me to perform big concerts. So, after graduating, I decided to go for it. I didn't think I'd be a good lawyer anyway.","Music has to change. I don't want to stay the same forever.","'Sixth Street' is probably a new chapter for me. All of the songs were written in my apartment where I'm most comfortable, and at that point, I understood who I was and knew what I was feeling about life.","Sometimes I have a melody in my head; sometimes it's just a verse. I read lines from a book or movies that I watch and grab a few quotes and start writing on paper. From there, I record a really rough version and work on the song.","One of the reasons I picked up the guitar is because I saw a video of Feist performing in Paris.","Lupe Fiasco is kinda cool. I like him a lot.","When I first started in Malaysia, having a Muslim Malay girl singing and holding a guitar was new to everyone. Even Muslims there had issues with it; they found it weird.","Muslim girls, we love fashion! Whether we wear the hijab or not - it's our choice - and it's time the industry took note. Finally, fashion stores are open to that idea.","There's a lot of buying power from the Middle East. Girls from Dubai want to be able to wear Asos, and you have people travelling all the way to the States just to go shopping.","I used to read a lot of fashion magazines: my favourite was 'Nylon.' I used to cut out all the pictures from magazines, and I had this book where I would keep all of the stuff that inspired me.","I love Gwen Stefani. I'd watch what she'd wear over and over again and think, 'How do I nail this style?' And then, I like that classic beauty, too. Audrey Hepburn, she's so elegant.","I write songs about love because, above all, love is the most human thing we have together. Feelings are a part of us every day. You feel things every day, no matter where you are. So that's what I write about.","I've seen a couple white girls coming to my concerts wearing head wraps, and I think they look so cute. It's kind of sad to see that people are really into separation, trying to separate everybody and making a clear division of 'us against you,' even with fashion. That sucks. It's not the way the world is supposed to be.","It's like with feminism. We talk a lot about feminism meaning complete freedom, and for some people, that means, like, 'Free the nipple!' But there's another end of the feminist spectrum, and that's where people like me are.","Feminism is universal. You can't just fight for one type of freedom or one type of female power. You know what? Muslim women want to cover up, and we have to fight for our right to do that, too.","For Eid - or Raya, as the Malaysians call it - we love to shop for new clothes for the festive season. There will be open houses to go to, and Malaysians love to look good for these.","I grew up in a town called Subang Jaya, and made a lot of friends from around Kuala Lumpur.","I don't really like the idea of putting myself in any category now... I think that people are looking for music that's real and honest and that they can relate to emotionally.","Appreciate your heart; really know how to take care of your heart."],"Yunjin Kim":["I'm very good about eating breakfast, lunch and dinner.","I grew up in New York.","You have to treat Hollywood like it's your boyfriend - he's there all the time.","If it's nice out, I swim pretty much every day for about half an hour. I have a great pool; it's very private and not too many people use it.","I'm not really into weight training.","I like to do Pilates.","I know when I was growing up in New York, whenever I turned on the television, I never saw a face that looked like me. Whenever there was an Asian person on television, it would be a huge event, me calling to my older sister 'There's an Asian person on television!' It was unheard of back then.","I love nature."],"Yunus Emre":["Thought is an errand boy, fear a mine of worries.","A heart makes a good home for the friend.","If I told you about a land of love, friend, would you follow me and come?"],"Yuri Andropov":["Malicious attacks on the Soviet Union produce a natural feeling of indignation.","Industry is extremely slow in readjusting itself to the manufacture of modern consumer goods.","One must say bluntly that it is an unattractive sight when, with a view to smearing the Soviet people, leaders of such a country as the United States resort to what almost amounts to obscenities alternating with hypocritical preaching about morals and humanism.","Responsible statesmen have only one choice - to do everything possible to prevent a nuclear catastrophe. Any other position is short-sighted; more so, it is suicidal."],"Yuri Gagarin":["I could have gone on flying through space forever.","I see Earth! It is so beautiful!"],"Yuri Kochiyama":["People have a right to violence, to rebel, to fight back.","I didn't wake up and decide to become an activist. But you couldn't help notice the inequities, the injustices. It was all around you.","I lived in San Pedro, California, which is, you know, on the west side of California, and it's where many, many Japanese lived.","I tell you, in this country, you don't get much of an education. Throughout high school, through junior college, which is all I went, I didn't know anything about the annihilation of all the Indian nations that were here.","Projects meant living with blacks and Puerto Ricans, but that's what we wanted. Living in the projects, we've met so many wonderful, wonderful people.","When you're in a black group, you have to keep in mind you're not black. You just have to be sensitive. We have to be appreciative that the black nationalist struggle is a nationalist struggle."],"Yuri Lowenthal":["'Red Robin' was just another audition, like a lot of other auditions. I just lucked out, and I got it. It's a great group of people I get to work with. Roger Craig Smith and Will Friedle and a bunch of guys. It's fun!","I've always wanted to be Batman, but I don't naturally tend towards Batman. I tend towards Robin, but I did get to play Superman.","I'd love to play Moon Knight. I don't know if anybody's doing a Moon Knight animated series any time soon.","I've been writing for a long time, and I've loved comic books for a long time - forever - but I had to learn how to write in a different way to write sequential art for a graphic novel. It's been an interesting transition.","Occasionally, especially on video games and with a lot of the fighting stuff, to get what you feel is the proper sound, you have to imitate what you're doing, and occasionally I've gotten carried away and kicked over mic stands or punched things.","I do a lot of voice over for Japanese anime titles as well as live-action stuff and original stuff from the States. 'Legion of Super Heroes,' 'New Wolverine: The X - Men' animated series, 'Afro Samurai' and some live-action stuff, TV shows here and there - I like to mix it up.","I love when I go to conventions, and often it'll be the younger kids who will refer to us by our character names - how can you not find that absolutely charming? I remember when I used to go to conventions when I was a kid when I would stand in long lines to get people's autograph.","It usually starts with the director and any other creatives who may be involved at the start. It's a collaboration. I bring what I have naturally and, hopefully, what they cast me for, and then we start playing and tweaking until we have what they feel's right. It helps to have some artwork to inspire me, but I don't always get that luxury.","I follow the director's lead because they generally know more about the big picture, but I also trust that the director will give me enough freedom to play.","Sometimes I become attached to a character because I've gotten to explore him for so long, like in the case of Ben, but sometimes I fall in love with a throwaway character who exists for only one scene in a video game like The Drunken Villager in 'Diablo III' or Sandal in 'Dragon Age.'","Man, it's hard to beat having gotten to play Superman. But where do you go from there? Aren't careers supposed to culminate in a role like that? And because I'm a big fat geek, as long as there's stuff I'm excited about - and isn't that really the definition of geek? - there'll always be roles I'd love to play.","Personally, the first year when I started making enough money just from acting - by that, I mean not doing anything else but acting - was around 2003.","The line between anime and regular animation is very difficult to cross, even for people who have been doing anime successfully for years.","I go to work and get to hang out with nothing but my kind of guys!","I speak from a nerd's perspective because I've been watching anime since I was a kid. I grew up on 'Speed Racer' and 'Star Blazers' and 'Battle of the Planets,' and those were some of my first A) cartoons and B) introduction to Japanese couture before I even knew they were Japanese.","As far as actors who pop up again and again in Japanese dubs, and because they're really good actors, people like Steve Bloom, not only in 'Cowboy Bebop,' but also he's sort of the de-facto Wolverine. If you're doing an animated Wolverine anything, Marvel usually just goes to Steve first because he's recognized as that voice.","A storytelling device teaches. I hate to say it that way, because kids tune out. I don't teach on purpose, but I'm glad that it happens sometimes.","A lot of the characters I play on Japanese shows are actually acted in Japan by women. I don't know what that says about me.","I've been a fan for a long time, and it's a reason I wanted to be a part of it. Now I'm able to do the 'Robotech' movie, and it's something I grew up watching. To actually be on 'Robotech' was really an experience.","A lot of times, for videogames, you get almost no time to prepare with a script. You've got a director that's going line for line, filling you in on what's happening, and some games are even less than that."],"Yuri Milner":["I'm just focused on exploring new opportunities.","You have to travel globally today to know what's going on and maintain an edge.","The problem is that modern fundamental physics is so far from you and me. The mathematics has become so much more complicated that you need at least 10 years to understand it. Fundamental physics has advanced so far from the understanding of most people that there is really a big disconnect.","The largest newspaper in the United States is only reaching 1 percent of population. We are kind of assuming that 'Wall Street Journal,' 'USA Today,' and other newspapers are very important. Yes, they're extremely important, but only to 1 percent of the population on a daily basis.","I have invested in four social networks. More than any other.","I have invested in four social networks. More than any other. But that's in Russia and Poland.","I must analyze, from what I do now, what will be the impact two or three or five years in the future. What is the statement I want to make?","Facebook didn't know how successful Zynga would be.","Google never knew how successful key words would be.","Facebook now is mostly about people you know. In the future it could be about people you know less but are more important.","Facebook can be an accumulation of different intelligences.","Facebook is at the forefront. It's the company that can fundamentally change the way information is being exchanged and processed. It can be the basis for artificial intelligence to develop over time.","Social is a better way to interact with digital world. It is better than search. Implications for... everything. Total change.","We've only made three investments: Facebook, Groupon, and Zynga.","My background is in theoretical physics, and it's something very close to my heart.","Fundamental physics is like an art more or less. It's completely non-practical, and you can't use it for anything. But it's about the universe and how the world came into being. It's very remote from your daily life and mine, and yet it defines us as human beings.","Google never knew how successful key words would be. Facebook didn't know how successful Zynga would be.","Facebook can be an accumulation of different intelligences. Ask a question, translated into many languages and somebody, somewhere in the world, will have an answer.","When you have a few billion people connected with screens, not voice... screens are important. You can transmit a thousand times more information.","Story was that human civilization started to develop with first social network. Emerged where population concentration was high. Helped propel to where we are now. Facebook is next step of creating a huge human brain to embrace hundreds of million, possibly billions of people.","The company that creates one global social graph will be very important going forward. It will be Facebook, with maybe 2-3 local social networks able to sustain competition long term.","Russia is one of the places where significant presence of social networks are driven by domestic players right now.","I have this ratio that if you divide age of entrepreneur by market cap of company. For Facebook it's one. Every year of his life Zuckerberg has been making $1 billion for investors.","We monitor close to 50 companies globally that can be potential investment opportunities. I'd like to see DST as a significant global investment company in the Internet arena.","You know among people who kind of travel a lot and have exposure to the United States and some other countries, they do have accounts, but you know, Russia is not exactly the place with multiple language skills so local networks kind of have an edge.","It's not about revenues: The fundamental economics in digital business is scale and margins. The top line has become the bottom line.","It's not how much something's worth today, it's what it's worth in five or 10 years.","I think top scientists need to be compensated at a different scale in society. Somebody with experience will tell you that true scientists are not motivated by money - they are motivated by the quest itself. That is true. But I think an additional recognition will not hurt.","Science is one of a handful of things that defines us as a very special species. It is amazing how far we have been able to get and how accurate our predictions are. I think understanding how the universe was born is very important. It really gives us a perspective on many things.","It is hard to think of practical applications of the black hole. Because practical applications are so remote, many people assume we should not be interested. But this quest to understand the world is what defines us as human beings.","One of the companies that we've invested in is called Facebook. In only two years, between 2009 and 2011, the information exchanged between people increased 28 times. And that cannot be explained by new people joining Facebook.","Big Internet companies on average are capable of generating revenue of $1 million per employee, and that compares to 10 to 20 percent of that which is normally generated by traditional offline businesses of comparable size.","There is huge demand for artificial intelligence technologies.","I am not an oligarch. I am a servant and I try to align my interests and those of my investors.","Facebook is a platform inside a platform.","I think there's a time to be private and a time to be public, and I think that companies like Facebook and Groupon are basically transformational companies. You don't come across them very often, and I'm pretty sure that they can continue to grow for a long time even being public.","Kai-Fu's Innovation Works is the top very-early-stage fund in China. We are proud to be an investor, and hope that IW will help to produce in China companies on the scale of Facebook, Zynga, or Groupon.","There is a significant momentum behind the social Internet. A wide range of public investors were very enthusiastic about that.","I'm trying to learn from various corners of the world."],"Yusef Komunyakaa":["I define poetry as celebration and confrontation. When we witness something, are we responsible for what we witness? That's an on-going existential question. Perhaps we are and perhaps there's a kind of daring, a kind of necessary energetic questioning. Because often I say it's not what we know, it's what we can risk discovering.","Through the years I have seen myself as a peaceful person, but the awareness of the anger is part of that process.","I originally wanted to embrace the imagery and forthrightness of rap music. There are some interesting, dynamic voices in rap. But I find most of it irresponsible in its overt violence and commercialization of anger. As artists, we believe we can will action through language. If that's the case, we have to take responsibility for what we say.","Students often have such a lofty idea of what a poem is, and I want them to realize that their own lives are where the poetry comes from. The most important things are to respect the language; to know the classical rules, even if only to break them; and to be prepared to edit, to revise, to shape.","Vietnam helped me to look at the horror and terror in the hearts of people and realize how we can't aim guns and set booby traps for people we have never spoken a word to. That kind of impersonal violence mystifies me.","I see many black males grasping for some thread of hope. There are so many destructive practices, glimpses into a psychic abyss. That must be very frightening.","Poetry helps me understand who I am. It helps me understand the world around me. But above all, what poetry has taught me is the fact that I need to embrace mystery in order to be completely human.","I excavate history. I look at lives buried under too much silence. Periods of time, like slavery, have to be revisited, reimagined, so we can move through them.","My great-grandfather Melvin had been a carpenter - so was my father - and they taught me the value of tools: saws, hammers, chisels, files and rulers. It all dealt with conciseness and precision. It eliminated guesswork. One has to know his tools, so he doesn't work against himself.","I'm uncomfortable with the focus on the poet and not on the poem.","I think of my poems as personal and public at the same time. You could say they serve as psychological overlays. One fits on top of the other, and hopefully there's an ongoing evolution of clarity.","Poets are seen as the caretakers of language, so working with words no matter what the form is what we do.","We have to embrace the good over the bad. That has to be one's personal project.","It wasn't a deliberate decision to become a poet. It was something I found myself doing - and loving. Language became an addiction.","I like what Oliver Lakes does on the saxophone. The saxophone comes pretty close to the sound of the human voice and when Oliver plays with other sax players, it's like a dialogue.","I like connecting the abstract to the concrete. There's a tension in that. I believe the reader or listener should be able to enter the poem as a participant. So I try to get past resolving poems.","It took me 14 years to write poems about Vietnam. I had never thought about writing about it, and in a way I had been systematically writing around it."],"Yusef Lateef":["When the soul looks out of its body, it should see only beauty in its path. These are the sights we must hold in mind, in order to move to a higher place.","My music is jazz."],"Yusuf Hamied":["If you look at the world's top 50 drugs being sold today, they are being marketed and sold by companies that did not invent them. I respect patents. I'll pay a royalty. But I shouldn't be denied the right to produce drugs for poor people at reasonable prices.","India made a big mistake by signing up to TRIPS. With a population of 1.3 billion, India can't afford a monopoly in healthcare. Monopolies lead to higher prices and we can't allow them in a country like India with so much poverty and misery. It was like signing our own death warrant.","As long as I can contribute, I'll continue working.","Patients are becoming aware that they're being taken for a ride by big pharma companies. They charge high prices and have never cared for India's healthcare. There are 23 million cases of cancer every year and India has a fair share of that.","Cipla has a strong professional management team, and we take team decisions. My brother has been working at Cipla since 1973.","Unfortunately, the mechanism for doing philanthropy in a structured way isn't yet in place in India. I already do a fair bit and support various causes such as education, sanitation, health. But selling costly drugs at affordable prices is philanthropy in itself.","Cipla has already developed a generic version, oseltamivir, which would be much cheaper than Tamiflu, the only available drug effective in treating avian flu.","Alleviation of suffering is my fundamental principle.","I had seen AIDS patients in India and Africa, and knowing that people were dying even though drugs existed that could help them was shattering for me.","Reducing the price of AIDS drugs gave me so much satisfaction that I've been thinking what else I could do. One day, I thought, 'Let's look at cancer and see how we can spare cancer patients' unnecessary suffering.'","Reducing the price of cancer drugs is a humanitarian move.","My father never forced me, but chemistry was my best subject.","I want it to be said when I leave this world that 'he was not just a money-making machine.'","I believe that life-saving, essential drugs should be freely available and the innovator should be paid a suitable royalty payment for his invention.","Clinton has played a major role in giving companies like Cipla credibility, for which I will always be grateful.","Every country has the right to determine its own laws. And India can't afford monopolies.","If tomorrow the Chinese decide not to supply the world with raw materials, the pharma industry would collapse.","AIDS today is not a death sentence. It can be treated as a chronic illness, or a chronic disease.","I do believe anybody manufacturing products for healthcare cannot regard it truly as a 100 per cent business: it is business plus a humanitarian approach to society because you are saving lives. You are playing with people's lives."],"Yuval Noah Harari":["There is a saying that if you get something for free, you should know that you're the product. It was never more true than in the case of Facebook and Gmail and YouTube. You get free social-media services, and you get free funny cat videos. In exchange, you give up the most valuable asset you have, which is your personal data.","Censorship no longer works by hiding information from you; censorship works by flooding you with immense amounts of misinformation, of irrelevant information, of funny cat videos, until you're just unable to focus.","Traditionally, life has been divided into two main parts: a period of learning followed by a period of working. Very soon, this traditional model will become utterly obsolete, and the only way for humans to stay in the game will be to keep learning throughout their lives and to reinvent themselves repeatedly.","Take Google Maps or Waze. On the one hand, they amplify human ability - you are able to reach your destination faster and more easily. But at the same time, you are shifting the authority to the algorithm and losing your ability to find your own way.","Nothing should be taken for granted, even if everybody believes it.","What I try to focus on is not to try to stop the march of technological progress. Instead, I try to run faster. If Amazon knows you better than you know yourself, then the game is up.","You take fantasies, which for thousands of years belonged to the religious realm - overcoming death or our merging with the universe - and you suddenly start talking about them in a more technical perspective as something that can be achieved, not after you die with the help of supernatural beings, but in this very life with the help of technology.","The domesticated chicken is probably the most widespread bird in the annals of planet Earth. If you measure success in terms of numbers, chickens, cows and pigs are the most successful animals ever.","Our bodies and minds evolved and were adapted for hundreds of thousands of years for tasks like climbing a tree and picking apples, or hunting rabbits, or looking for mushrooms in the forest. They were not adapted to the very gruelling work that is involved in field work - ploughing, harvesting, bringing water, digging weeds - things like that.","Humans have an amazing capacity to believe in contradictory things. For example, to believe in an omnipotent and benevolent God but somehow excuse Him from all the suffering in the world. Or our ability to believe from the standpoint of law that humans are equal and have free will and from biology that humans are just organic machines.","We did not domesticate wheat; wheat domesticated us.","The truly unique trait of 'Sapiens' is our ability to create and believe fiction. All other animals use their communication system to describe reality. We use our communication system to create new realities. Of course, not all fictions are shared by all humans, but at least one has become universal in our world, and this is money.","The feelings of the individual are the prime authority in ethics. 'If it feels good, do it' is the basic ethical ideal of humanism.","The key to victory lies more in manipulation and cooperation than in exceptional personal skills.","We are all living together on a single planet, which is threatened by our own actions. And if you don't have some kind of global cooperation, nationalism is just not on the right level to tackle the problems, whether it's climate change or whether it's technological disruption.","The basic human reaction to pleasure is not satisfaction, but rather craving for more. Hence, no matter what we achieve, it only increases our craving, not our satisfaction.","I think, in general, medicine in the 21st century will switch from healing the sick to upgrading the healthy... If you find ways to repair the memory damaged by Alzheimer's disease or dementia and so forth, it is very likely that the same methods could be used to upgrade the memory of completely healthy people.","Modernity is a deal. The entire contract can be summarised in a single phrase: humans agree to give up meaning in exchange for power.","If we are allowed to do experiments on monkeys because we are superior to them in a certain way, then someone who is superior to me is allowed to do experiments on me.","The idea that humans will always have a unique ability beyond the reach of non-conscious algorithms is just wishful thinking.","How do you cause people to believe in an imagined order such as Christianity, democracy, or capitalism? First, you never admit that the order is imagined.","My main ambition as a historian is to figure out what's really happening in the world, instead of the fictions that humans have been creating for thousands of years in order to explain or control what's happening in the world.","People have long feared that mechanization might cause mass unemployment. This never happened because, as old professions became obsolete, new professions evolved, and there was always something humans could do better than machines. Yet this is not a law of nature, and nothing guarantees it will continue to be like that in the future.","Humans think in stories, and we try to make sense of the world by telling stories.","All the major problems of the world today are global in essence, and they cannot be solved unless through some kind of global cooperation. It's not just climate change, which is, like, the most obvious example people give. I think more in terms of technological disruption.","The most important question in 21st-century economics may well be, 'What should we do with all the superfluous people, once we have highly intelligent non-conscious algorithms that can do almost everything better than humans?'","For thousands of years, humans believed that authority came from the gods. Then, during the modern era, humanism gradually shifted authority from deities to people.","Ignorance is not too dangerous. If you combine it with power, then this is a toxic mix.","Buddhism maintains that the common reaction of the human mind to pleasure and to achievement is not satisfaction; it's craving for more.","Techno-humanism aims to amplify the power of humans, creating cyborgs and connecting humans to computers, but it still sees human interests and desires as the highest authority in the universe.","The notion of superhumans is using bioengineering and artificial intelligence to upgrade human abilities. If they use the power to change themselves, to change their own minds, their own desires, then we have no idea what they will want to do.","We are probably one of the last generations of Homo sapiens.","We can suspend disbelief about Harry Potter, and we do the same thing with God, and we do the same thing with human rights, and we do the same thing with money.","Most people, they get overwhelmed by the religious stories, the nationalist stories, by the economic stories of the day, and take these stories to be the reality.","Animals are the main victims of history, and the treatment of domesticated animals in industrial farms is perhaps the worst crime in history.","Those who refuse to liberalise and globalise are doomed to failure.","If you don't like the word 'religion,' you can replace it with 'ideology' - it's largely the same thing. At the heart of both religion and ideology is the question of authority and where authority is coming from.","In Judaism or Christianity and so forth, you invent rules that don't exist anywhere except in your imagination. You spend your life trying to gain points and to avoid all kinds of things that detract from your points. And if by the time you die you gather enough points, then you pass on to the next level, in Heaven.","Until about 30,000 years ago, there were at least five other species of humans on the planet. Homo Sapiens, our ancestors, lived mainly in East Africa, and you had the Neanderthal in Europe, Homo Erectus in part of Asia, and so forth.","We control the world basically because we are the only animals that can cooperate flexibly in very large numbers. And if you examine any large-scale human cooperation, you will always find that it is based on some fiction like the nation, like money, like human rights.","Humans have two kinds of abilities: physical and cognitive.","Everybody since the '60s has been saying the nation is a fiction - the nation is an imaginary unity - but people didn't connect the dots and say all human endeavours sprang from the same principle.","Just as divine authority was legitimised by religious mythologies and human authority was legitimised by humanist ideologies, so high-tech gurus and Silicon Valley prophets are creating a new universal narrative that legitimises the authority of algorithms and Big Data.","There is no limit to how much health you can provide people.","Many people in their teens wonder about these big questions - what's the meaning of life, what are we doing here - then somewhere in their 20s, they seem to say, 'I'll just get married. I'll just have kids. I'll get back to that later.' But they never do. For me, it kept boiling.","Humans are extremely good in acquiring new power, but they are not very good in translating this power into greater happiness, which is why we are far more powerful than ever before but we don't seem to be much happier.","I try to be a realist and not a pessimist or an optimist.","We are living in a global world - but most schools and books still tell us only parochial histories of one particular country or culture. The truth is that there are no longer any independent countries in the world.","As algorithms push humans out of the job market, wealth and power might become concentrated in the hands of the tiny elite that owns the all-powerful algorithms, creating unprecedented social and political inequality. Alternatively, the algorithms might themselves become the owners.","The most dangerous thing about terrorism is the over-reaction to it.","Since the beginning of the computer age, there has been immense development in computer intelligence but exactly zero development in computer consciousness.","The old 20th-century political model of Left vs. Right is now basically irrelevant, and the real divide today is between global and national, global or local. All over the world, this is not the main struggle.","Homo sapiens is a social being, and our well-being depends to a large extent on the quality and depth of our social and family relations - and in the last 200 years, they have been disintegrating.","For many centuries, even thousands of years, patriotism worked quite well. Of course, it led to wars an so forth, but we shouldn't focus too much on the bad.","For thousands of years, we have gained the power to control the world outside us but not to control the world inside. You could stop a river from flowing, but you could not stop your body from becoming old. You could kill mosquitoes, but you could not kill annoying thoughts buzzing inside your head.","Intelligence is the ability to solve problems, whereas consciousness is the ability to feel things such as pain, joy, love, and anger. Throughout history, intelligence always went hand in hand with consciousness.","Dollar bills have absolutely no value except in our collective imagination, but everybody believes in the dollar bill.","As a historian, I'm sceptical about conspiracy theories because the world is far too complicated to be managed by a few billionaires drinking scotch behind some closed doors. But I do think that the voters are correct in sensing that they're really losing power. And in reaction, they give the system an angry kick.","It's very, very difficult to reinvent yourself when you're 40 or 50, whether you are a taxi driver who now needs to become a web designer, or anything else. It just becomes more difficult and more scary.","Even what people take to be their most personal desires are usually programmed by the imagined order.","Homo sapiens, you and me, we are basically the same as people 10,000 years ago. The next revolution will change that.","I'm a historian. I really like the past. But most people seem far more interested in what you can tell them about the future.","I grew up in a small industrial suburb of Haifa in Israel. As far back as I remember, I was interested in big questions. Who are we? What are we doing here? But the chances to discuss philosophy were quite thin on the ground.","I'm vegan, though not completely religious about it. While writing 'Sapiens,' I became familiar with how we treat animals in the meat and dairy industries. I was so horrified that I didn't want to be a part of it anymore.","I met my husband Itzik when I got back home to Israel from Oxford in 2002. He is my Internet-of-all-Things.","If you take 10,000 chimpanzees and cram them together into Wembley Stadium or the Houses of Parliament, you will get chaos. But if you take 10,000 people who have never met before, they can co-operate and create amazing things.","I was taught that if you're going to study something, you must understand it deeply and be familiar with primary sources. But if you write a history of the whole world, you can't do this. That's the trade-off.","You have to know how to co-operate with other people if you want to stay alive and raise children. And to do that, you need to know something about them. You need to know who loves whom, who hates whom, who is sleeping with whom. Who is honest, who is a cheat.","All animals communicate. What's special about gossip is that it's not about the here and now. You don't gossip about lions. You don't gossip about clouds. You only gossip about other people. And once you do, you can keep track of many more people - this is the basis for forming larger communities.","In order to survive in a very small tribe, you needed to know how to do lots of things for yourself: how to make your tools, how to get food, and how to make your clothes - things most of us today don't need to know. The only thing I need to survive is to know history.","Humanist thinkers such as Rousseau convinced us that our own feelings and desires were the ultimate source of meaning and that our free will was, therefore, the highest authority of all.","Every day, I absorb countless data bits through emails, phone calls, and articles; process the data; and transmit back new bits through more emails, phone calls, and articles. I don't really know where I fit into the great scheme of things and how my bits of data connect with the bits produced by billions of other humans and computers.","You need to constantly remind yourself what is the most important thing that is happening in the world - what is the most important thing that is happening in history. The discipline to have this focus is something I gained from meditation.","When you look at the growth of the human economy and its expected growth in the twenty-first century, I expect health will be the most important market of all. Especially as we move from a concept of health which focuses on healing the sick to a concept of upgrading the healthy.","What's more valuable - intelligence or consciousness?","Fundamentally, mankind was unimportant in the ecological system. Then, in one fell swoop, an evolutionary blink of an eye, the human race is transformed from something unimportant to the most important thing in the world.","As beavers build dams and bees build hives, human beings have spears. Or take the high intelligence of human beings, the ability to make plans, to transmit information - that was also there before, but that, together with the tools, was not enough to make man special.","Money is the probably the most successful story ever told. It has no objective value... but then you have these master storytellers: the big bankers, the finance ministers... and they come, and they tell a very convincing story.","Dataism is a new ethical system that says, yes, humans were special and important because up until now they were the most sophisticated data processing system in the universe, but this is no longer the case.","You go to a Japanese restaurant and have a wonderful dish, and the thing to do is take a picture with your phone, put it on Facebook, and see how many likes you get. If you don't share your experiences, they don't become part of the data processing system, and they have no meaning.","When the first humans reached Australia about 45,000 years ago, they quickly drove to extinction 90% of its large animals. This was the first significant impact that Homo sapiens had on the planet's ecosystem. It was not the last.","About 15,000 years ago, humans colonised America, wiping out in the process about 75% of its large mammals. Numerous other species disappeared from Africa, from Eurasia, and from the myriad islands around their coasts. The archaeological record of country after country tells the same sad story.","In 1989, with the end of the Cold War and the collapse of communism, it seemed that the liberal story had won. The liberal story says that humankind is inevitably marching towards a global society of free markets and democratic politics.","In the 1990s and 2000s, the liberal story shaped not only the foreign policy of the United States and its allies, but also the domestic policies of governments across the world, from South Africa to Indonesia.","People already have bionic arms and legs that work by the power of thought. And we increasingly outsource mental and communicative activities to computers. We are merging with our smartphones. Very soon, they will just be part of the body.","Increasingly, our decisions will be made by the algorithms that surround us. Whenever there is a big dilemma, you just ask Google what to do. And what kind of life is that?","I'm not a very glamorous person. I like to just sit alone in a room and read a book or meditate.","The widespread assumption is that somehow, the brain produces the mind; somehow millions of neurons fire signals at one another create or produce consciousness... but we have no idea how or why this happens. I'm afraid that in many cases, people in the tech world fail to understand that.","Intelligence is the ability to solve problems, and consciousness is the ability to feel things and have subjective experiences.","Having raised humanity above the beastly level of survival struggles, we will now aim to upgrade humans into gods and turn Homo sapiens into Homo deus.","Homo sapiens does its best to forget the fact, but it is an animal.","I think the basic thing that happened is we have lost our story. Humans think in stories, and we try to make sense of the world by telling stories.","For thousands of years, until about 1850, you see humans accumulating more and more power by the invention of new technologies and by new systems of organization in the economy and in politics, but you don't see any real improvement in the well-being of the average person.","Science is telling us that the reason people die is not because some god said so or because the laws of nature mandate it. People always die because of technical problems. And every technical problem has, in principle, a technical solution.","I titled the book 'Homo Deus' because we really are becoming gods in the most literal sense possible. We are acquiring abilities that have always been thought to be divine abilities - in particular, the ability to create life. And we can do with that whatever we want.","I don't like the word 'abstractions' very much because most people don't think in abstractions. That is too difficult for them. They think in stories. And the best stories are not abstract; they are concrete.","If you think about the great religions that have united large parts of humankind, people believe gods are very concrete - there is an angry old man in the sky, and if I do something wrong, he will punish me."],"Yuvraj Singh":["I have been in love, and it was a great feeling. It's when you are attracted to and feel affection for someone. You want to do things for that person. But only love isn't enough in a relationship - understanding and communication are very important aspects.","Relationships survive on trust, and if that is broken at any point, it's pretty much the end of the relationship. Besides, inability to communicate leads to problems.","Being the vice-captain, you see a lot of things on the field. You have to try and help the captain as much as you can and lead by example on the field. Small things like getting a run-out or taking a catch makes the other boys try and lift their standards. So yes, I do have an important role, even if I'm not captain.","Cancer has taught me a lot of things. Maybe it is the best thing that has happened to me. I can't say right now, but maybe some years down the line, I would realise. When I was taking chemotherapy, there were a lot of elderly patients, and that would inspire me. I thought, 'If they can be cured, why can't I be?'","When one is young, aspiring to play for the country, doing well, any hindrance, like injury or being out of form, can be frustrating and a cause of annoyance or even anger. But once you have a close encounter with death, you realise the real value of life.","No matter what people say, about what I did, about what I am like... They say you are not dedicated or hardworking. A lot of people say things about me, but they don't realise I have played 250 games. It's not like you just land up in the team, sit down and play 250 games. You can't survive like that in international cricket.","The battle against cancer has made me strong. It's like winning a war! When I was diagnosed, I was told by doctors my kidney, liver and other organs could fail. It was tough. I didn't know if I could save my life. But I was positive, and because of that, the doctor told me that I would be a man who would never have cancer.","When I was a kid, I used to try and hit every ball out of the ground. After playing one-day cricket and Test cricket, I never thought I'd get a chance to play like that again, ever. Twenty20 has given me the opportunity of playing like a kid again. I can just feel free and go out there and hit.","I want someone who will love me for the person I am and not because of my status. It has to be someone who understands the pressure of playing for India. It will be very difficult to be with a person who has her own career because someone has to make sacrifices for the family and house.","I have stopped having goals. If you have many goals, and you don't reach your goals, it is very upsetting, so I just think of keeping it simple, working hard and going and playing the game. But I know there are going to be very important series for Indian cricket. I will just try my best to be in my fittest form.","People who don't know me, how will they know what I am really like? They will only see me on the field, only see me in an advertisement. People who know what kind of a guy I am will tell you I'm a very open person.","Cricket is my life. Before the cancer, I was happy-go-lucky. I used to think about my career and worry about the future. But post it, my thinking has completely changed. I'm happy to eat and breathe normally. I'm happy to have my life back.","I have been accused of things that I have never done. I have been called a perpetrator of incidents while I was actually a peacemaker. I really don't know why. Yuvraj Singh isn't a party animal; he is just singled out. I don't know why.","I cried like a baby. When no one could see me or hear me. Not because I feared what cancer would do, but because I didn't want the disease. I wanted my life to be normal, which it could no longer be.","Obviously, a lot of things play on your mind when you're batting. This might happen and this might not. The best thing you can do when you're batting is not to think too much, and wait for the next ball.","In sport, there is always room for improvement. Whenever I see my innings against the West Indies or Australia, I think, 'Maybe, I could have done this better or should have changed that.' See, cricket is a skill game, and one can always improve upon the impact one has on an innings.","I have worked really hard on my game, but I think my mother has been a real pillar of strength. She has prayed a lot, sacrificed a lot for me. You know, she hasn't seen me bat so far. When I am batting, she is praying... mothers are like that, aren't they?","On the field, you have to be aggressive; you're thinking how to get the better of a situation. It's not that I don't laugh on the field. In fact, I think it's very important to laugh, especially when you are angry and aggressive, to just take the tension away, make the moment go away.","I am a great movie buff, and I devour films regularly.","The bad boy image is something given to me by the media. I have been in relationships earlier, even for as long as three years. I am not saying I am a saint. I am like any other guy, I guess. Unfortunately, every time I even meet a person, it is reported as a link-up.","I'm past my wooing days now. See, I am an honest person. If I like a girl, I will go and tell her.","From a spectator point of view, Test cricket is not important; people hardly watch Test cricket. But as a player, Tests are the real thing. You have to concentrate for five days. It's a lot of time, and not easy to do it day in and day out. If people have played 70-100 Tests, it's a lot of cricket, a lot of concentration and dedication.","I will only think of settling down after Salman Khan, the other most eligible bachelor, plans to settle down. We are eligible bachelors, but he's the rock star, so let him get married first; then I'll think about myself.","I didn't believe when I was first told that I have cancer. I thought, 'How can a young person like me get cancer?' I thought it could never happen to me. It took me a while to realise that I was diagnosed with cancer.","There were times when chemo would eat my body, but I told myself that I have the strength and courage to win and come out stronger.","When I was going through my chemotherapy, I realized not many people are willing to talk about cancer, even after getting fully cured. Celebrities and educated people are also very protective and private about it. I still haven't understood why. I decided to fight my battle out in the public.","Beating cancer is personal battle. It was one of the toughest opponents I have faced so far, and I think I did reasonably well. Touch wood."],"Yves Behar":["Sometimes you can find peace of mind by transferring yourself to different situations. They're just reminders to stay... calm.","Our principal role as designers is to accelerate new ideas and the adoption of new ideas.","Design needs a new relationship with the world, one that is more focused on our planet's needs.","Consumers want products that tell stories, have magic, and inspire.","Design certainly has a cosmetic, aesthetic aim. It always aims at making things beautiful. But relevance is just as important. I often say, 'If it isn't ethical, it can't be beautiful. But if it isn't beautiful, it probably shouldn't be at all.'","The best design work is really done when you spend more time with people, when you have the opportunity to be of the same mindset and the same incentives as the founder of the business.","I never felt truly at home in Switzerland.","For me, it's not about being the best designer. I'm interested in being the best partner. The best collaborator.","My mantra is: 'Good design accelerates the adoption of new ideas.'","Steve Jobs changed my life. He also changed the life of every designer.","I think every business, really, has a unique reason for being, unique assets, unique attributes, a unique history. And that can be turned into a very attractive design story, essentially, that consumers can relate to.","For each project I do, I try to surprise myself, do the unexpected, and change my own status quo. From the One Laptop Per Child, the Herman Miller Sayl, or the latest Movado watch collection, there is always an insecurity about being able to do something important. I think each of those projects makes me feel like we have progressed.","I've been influenced by some of the greatest designers. Charles Eames. And Bruno Munari in the '50s in Italy - when they had to retool the industry of war into an industry to help society. In a way, I'm influenced by designers that were there at a radical time of change.","When clients come to my design agency and say 'I want to be the Apple of this or that,' we say 'Okay, are you ready to be the Steve Jobs?' Few are up to the task.","The notion of 'reduce and refine' is one I've pursued. I truly believe that by making things less complex, by finding innovative ways to make sustainability affordable, we can advance the notion that it is possible.","I want to work on things that aren't self-evident, to propose things that are radically different and game-changing.","What I learned from my years in Silicon Valley is that design can have a primary role in how a business is shaped, how a company can be design-driven. In my experience of large industry in Europe, that knowledge has been lost.","I wanted to be a writer as a teen... so storytelling was my first love. In my late teens, design became an obsession as I realized that I could express myself through the medium. Much later, when I founded Fuseproject in 1999, our slogan became 'design brings stories to life.'","Design is a tool that either allows us to create new markets or disrupt existing ones.","The biggest challenge is that when people look at low price point products, they essentially invest less money in development, innovation, and new technology. And in order to innovate at a lower price point, and make sustainability attainable to the masses, you have to invest more. But that's counterintuitive for a lot of businesses.","Part of my life is spent designing in urban centers, and part of my life has been spent in factories. But the other part of my life is spent in nature.","If you don't love something, it's not functional, in my opinion.","An ideal day for me is a combination of a fun-exciting creative moment with work partners, some laughs and games with my kids, a good surf session, and great conversation with friends around a meal.","When I first came to the Bay area, I worked in Silicon Valley in the early to mid-'90s, and I think what mattered then was our ability as designers to create a vision around people's ideas.","The idea of designing something that is like something else is incredibly uninteresting and boring.","Fuseproject was founded in 1999, and the notion behind it, which is alive and kicking today, is fusing different disciplines. Our teams are absolutely incredible at their own discipline, but most importantly, they're incredible at partnering with each other.","The Swiss can be very difficult.","I know it's a cliche, but I see myself as a citizen of the world. I was brought up in Switzerland by German and Turkish parents but I've very much grown up in San Francisco. I have a European sense of aesthetic, but I'm also deeply steeped in the notion of change and entrepreneurship that is associated with Silicon Valley.","I'm interested in technology for the masses. Good tech design should not just be for enthusiasts but for the general public. It should be something that touches everyone.","I am always looking for ways to move technology away from being over-featured. Moving to Silicon Valley in the mid-1990s meant I grew up as a designer in an environment where technology is a tool and not a means to an end. I believe that design should be driven by ideas, not style.","I have been working with Hive, part of British Gas, on reinventing the thermostat. Now you can control your heating at the press of a button on your phone. As I say, design should permeate every part of society.","What got me really excited about Tylko is the fact that it bridges the gap between tradition and technology. It expands the designer's ability to create a language, to create ideas, to create a set of proportions, a set of details, and to apply those across a really wide range of applications.","It's not about putting a speaker in a chair or putting a TV in a bed. That's not how technology and the home intersect. For me, it's about sensors, about the home knowing where you are.","Keyless entry in a car is something that we're used to. Somehow, the home has been very resistant to this. Some of it has to do with security, but today we know that technology, when things are invisible, is actually safer than physical artifacts.","The next step for me with the Up is how it talks with the rest of the home. It's an object that can tell the home where I am and what I'm doing.","Juicero is the first company to make cold-pressed juice something that people can make themselves at home. The challenges to design and engineer a press that can deliver 8,000 pounds of force are tremendous.","Integrating breakthrough technology into everyday products is always a challenge; at the same time, this is exactly how design makes tech products easily adoptable in life.","Every tech product on the body like Jawbone or in the home like August is different. But there are definitely principles that apply across the board for me, such as integration in everyday life and discretion.","Kodak has always represented innovation that is approachable while delivering the craft of filmmaking.","I truly believe that we're about to enter a second golden age of design. The first one was in the '50s and '60s, when designers like Raymond Loewy, Charles Eames, George Nelson and Dieter Rams were shepherds of the brands they were working with. They had influence over the products and how companies communicated and promoted themselves.","The role of designers and product makers is to really become much better editors. What kind of functionality is actually needed - and truly delightful - to consumers? Remove all the extraneous stuff.","Advertising is the price companies pay for being unoriginal.","Everything has yet to be invented. I never say 'green' - I say 'greener.' It's greener simply because this is a continuum of change, improvement and discovery.","Design accelerates the adoption of new ideas. And many of these ideas are important for designers to show that there is a way. When you see things through that lens, you realize it applies to any industry and any form of design.","I imagine a future with no waste; material innovations have already become exponentially more vast, and I do think the future needs to be cradle to cradle. If designed properly, one product could be used for many years before needing to be recycled, or its components reused.","I am extraordinarily fascinated by the future of technology. We are in the early infancy of technology, and we have an opportunity to guide how technology develops and integrates into our lives. I talk a lot about the 'invisible interface,' or the idea that we can utilize technology without being absorbed into a screen.","Having one foot in design and the other in sustainable and social projects, I hear this question quite often: 'Why does the world need another chair?' My answer is that the world needs another chair/bicycle/car or any new product for that matter, like the world needs another book.","I am passionate about what design can do - how far it can support the new ideas and the new ways of living of this 21st Century. Good design accelerates this exciting future where manufacturing is local, materials and processes are cradle to cradle, business models are both socially and financially driven.","I truly believe that everything Sci-fi taught me as a child about an efficient and wondrous world will be happening in my lifetime."],"Yves Chauvin":["Like all sciences, chemistry is marked by magic moments. For someone fortunate enough to live such a moment, it is an instant of intense emotion: an immense field of investigation suddenly opens up before you.","Various circumstances, mainly to do with my military service, prevented me from doing a Ph.D., and I have often regretted it, though you do need to choose the 'right' supervisor in the 'right' discipline - no easy task when you are totally inexperienced.","My motto is more, 'If you want to find something new, look for something new!' There is a certain amount of risk in this attitude, as even the slightest failure tends to be resounding, but you are so happy when you succeed that it is worth taking the risk.","I am still not a fussy eater, although I do enjoy good food.","My grandmother was fond of painting and playing the piano. She had been given lessons by Emmanuel Chabrier, who used to spend the summer months in nearby Membrolle.","To be perfectly truthful, I was not a very brilliant student, even at chemistry school.","There is no difference between fundamental research and applied research. Although this is my view, based on personal taste and the areas I have worked in, it is not necessarily true for others.","I have always been an avid reader of chemical literature, eager for what is new.","I had no training in research as such, and as a consequence, I am, in a sense, self-taught.","I used to spend my holidays there in my grandparents' large family house, with my numerous cousins. When I die, I am going to be buried in the village cemetery."],"Yves Klein":["For me, each nuance of a color is in some way an individual, a being who is not only from the same race as the base color, but who definitely possesses a distinct character and personal soul.","The dominant invades the entire picture, as it were. In this way I seek to individualize the color, because I have come to believe that there is a living world of each color and I express these worlds."],"Yves Montand":["Pacifists are like sheep who believe that wolves are vegetarians."],"Yves Rossy":["I was a pilot and flying hang gliders, paragliders, aerobatics airplanes, and then I discovered skydiving. Free fall. Free. With nothing around you, just a parachute on your back. And you go down. But you don't feel like you're going down. Total freedom.","As a child, I first wanted to be a cook because my mother was such a good cook.","I was always pretty good at designing things.","When I was young I had an apprenticeship as an engineer.","When you're in a fighter jet and there's a dark layer of clouds with just one blue hole with the sun going through it, you shoot for that hole. You go vertical into the light, and suddenly, instead of gray and dark, it's light and blue. You are totally connected with the elements. You are in another world."],"Yves Saint Laurent":["Fashions fade, style is eternal.","Dressing is a way of life.","Over the years I have learned that what is important in a dress is the woman who is wearing it.","We must never confuse elegance with snobbery.","I wish I had invented blue jeans. They have expression, modesty, sex appeal, simplicity - all I hope for in my clothes.","I have often said that I wish I had invented blue jeans: the most spectacular, the most practical, the most relaxed and nonchalant. They have expression, modesty, sex appeal, simplicity - all I hope for in my clothes.","I am no longer concerned with sensation and innovation, but with the perfection of my style.","I'm so secluded. Very alone.","Isn't elegance forgetting what one is wearing?","I couldn't love a woman who inspired me to be totally disinterested. If I fell in love with a woman for an artistic reason, or from the point of view of my work, I think it would rob her of something.","I want to thank all the women who have worn my clothes, the famous and the unknown, who have been so faithful to me and given me so much joy.","It pains me physically to see a woman victimized, rendered pathetic, by fashion.","A good model can advance fashion by ten years.","I adore America. It's an extraordinary country. A new country.","I'd really like to be in closer contact with life. I'm a little too distant, I guess. I like to place myself outside."],"Yves Tanguy":["The painting develops before my eyes, unfolding its surprises as it progresses. It is this which gives me the sense of complete liberty, and for this reason I am incapable of forming a plan or making a sketch beforehand.","Very much alone in my work, I am almost jealous of it.","Geography has no bearing on it, nor have the interests of the community in which I work.","I believe there is little to gain by exchanging opinions with other artists concerning either the ideology of art or technical methods."],"Yvette Clarke":["Even after facing jail, Martin Luther King, Jr. courageously and boldly spoke out against racial inequality.","We must never forget that Black History is American History. The achievements of African Americans have contributed to our nation's greatness.","Only by acknowledging the success and sacrifice made by those who came before us can we fully understand what we must do to ensure the liberty of those who will succeed us.","There is no doubt that Stop-and-Frisk does not yield the desired results, and it is apparent that it disproportionately targets minority communities.","I have to earn re-election. That's the way I see it.","Good Dems are good Dems. They want a representative that really reflects their values.","Only Congress has the authority to adequately and holistically address our broken immigration system.","I hope that the opening of the Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial will be a life-altering experience that inspires every American to rededicate themselves to the fulfillment of Dr. King's dream.","It was August 28th, 1963, and the greatest civil rights coalition in modern history had descended upon Washington. Hundreds of thousands of protesters trekked through the heat, stretching from the Washington Monument to the Lincoln Memorial.","We examine and highlight the history of the African descendants in America, and know that each and every one of us has come this far because of our faith in this country.","I would put myself towards left of center.","My father has been the real anchor of the family. He's the one who has always encouraged my mother, my brother and me."],"Yvette Mimieux":["There's a whole beautiful world out there, and it was like riding a magic carpet, getting to know exotic, faraway places.","We scuba dived in the Red Sea, the Pacific and the Indian oceans. We lived in Bali and India.","I suppose I had a soulful quality. I was often cast as a wounded person, the 'sensitive' role.","Most parts for women have them reacting to something a man has done. Women never instigate any action; they only react it. We women have become accustomed to doing that.","I believe women should be feminine.","I'd been acting since I was a teenager. I'd come to the point where I was writing my own movies of the week for TV. That was fun.","It's not the love affair I have with film, but television can be a playground for interesting ideas.","I love wild, baroque, slightly excessive theatrical ideas, and because television needs so much material, there's a chance to get some of those odd ideas done.","I learned to act reactively very well because those were the sorts of roles I was given for 20 years. It was hard to break out of that typecasting.","I have more control of the material if I produce. I can be much more active in choosing the writer, shaping the script, casting and editing the film.","I had always loved Haitian art, but I stumbled onto Haiti quite by accident. I went there on vacation after finishing a movie called 'The Delta Factor,' and I met lot of painters and fell in love with their folk art.","I decided I didn't want to have a totally public life. When the fan magazines started wanting to take pictures of me making sandwiches for my husband, I said no.","There are tribes in Africa who believe that a camera steals a little part of your soul, and in a way, I think that's true about living your private life in public. It takes something away from your relationships; it cheapens them.","I don't like to tell my age. Not because of vanity, but because in 10 years when I look 37, producers will think I'm too old for some parts.","I think we have to be very careful how we treat people, even when we are supposedly trying to help them.","Women are good at emotional things. We are emotional people. It is much harder to be cold and unemotional.","The critics mostly review the budgets when they go to see a big-budget movie. They are out to get a big-budget movie. On the other hand, if they review a picture that is done as a graduate thesis by some college film student for $25,000, it is almost sure to be admired and respected.","While I prefer generally more personal dramas in which I can stretch myself... and while I'm not a science fiction buff, I consider '2001' a great film, absolutely enthralling; at 'Star Wars' I had a fabulous time, and, at 'Alien,' while it was a silly story, I was knocked out.","I'd love to spend a year at the Sorbonne studying French culture.","Like many other tourists, I'm afraid I fell in love with Paris at first sight.","Have you noticed that they write parts for mute women but not for mute men? It must be a masculine dream: a woman who can feel and hear but not talk!","To give a successful character portrayal on stage or on film, the part has to be played inside of you.","Stage acting lets you feel the character a little better, but in the movies, you have to keep regenerating your energy level when shooting scenes over and over again.","I've been painting all my life, and I'm serious about it. I use it as more or less an outlet.","In 'Forbidden Love,' my character is a divorcee who has an affair with a young doctor. They are blissfully happy and have everything going for them. But their peers, friends, her daughter, and his family disapprove, and the affair ends.","There's no reason women in their late 30s and 40s shouldn't be thought of sexually.","Age should be no consideration between two people romantically or sexually involved. Social approval shouldn't even be considered.","I've never been one to enjoy just sitting around.","The less I give of myself to the public, the less I can be hurt."],"Yvette Nicole Brown":["I would love it if people could look at chubby folks with all of our curves, bumps and ridges and just say 'She's beautiful' just like that. You don't have to get on a treadmill as long as your blood pressure is under control and you eat healthy, God bless.","We all have our down days, but it's not hard to smile and say, 'Thank you.'","It is very important as a human being to be able to laugh at yourself and circumstances and particularly as a Christian. We have to know that good times don't last always and bad times don't last always.","I think God has a sense of humor, and the way my lessons come from God is very funny. I have to laugh at myself even if it's a tough lesson.","It's great if you're funny or if you can dance, but if you are kind and decent, it comes out your pores.","Love is easy! Kindness is easy. So I try on my Twitter page to acknowledge everyone that reaches out to me. I try to make my page - I can't control the rest of Twitter - but I try to make my page a safe place for people.","I don't blame other people for the rap that Christians have. A lot of Christians are just mental. A lot of Christians are more concerned with telling you where you're gonna go when you die than what you can have while you're here.","It's very rare, as an actor, to be someplace - to have an address, so to speak.","Christ's strength is manifest in our weakness, so if we had everything together there would be no need for Him.","'Community' is a comedy show, and one of the characters happens to be a Christian. I do think they have been very careful to make sure everyone is the butt of the joke for various reasons.","I would love to walk into a mall and see more than two or three stores that cater to women who are a size 14 and up!","I love Jill Scott! I love everything she puts on, how she does her hair; everything about Jill Scott is amazing!","I love Queen Latifah! Queen Latifah is so beautiful! Every time you see her, if it's in a cosmetics ad, or on the red carpet, she's always flawless.","I have a list in my mind and in my heart of actors who have been extraordinarily kind, and Hugh Laurie is near the top.","What I love to say when people ask me about being a Christian, I always say, 'Christians aren't perfect.' They're probably some of the worst people on the planet. They just know that they need Jesus. That's the only difference.","You want good ratings, you want people to like the show, you want to be appreciated for the hard work you put in. You don't always get it. Every show is not beloved.","I know that there's people that have expectations of me, and I'm a people pleaser, so I want them to be happy.","I'm not that ambitious chick. I'm not chasing a cover of a magazine or an award. I've just never been that girl. I've always been very content with whatever God blessed me with and he's already blessed me with a lot.","Oh my God, Betty White is actually everything that you would expect her to be like."],"Yvon Chouinard":["I'm kind of like a samurai. They say if you want to be a samurai, you can't be afraid of dying, and as soon as you flinch, you get your head cut off. I'm not afraid of losing this business.","Traveling is my form of self-education. Every stream I fish now is not as good as it used to be. Traveling is my form of self-education. Every stream I fish now is not as good as it used to be. If you keep your eyes open as you travel around, you realize we are destroying this planet.","I believe the accepted model of capitalism that demands endless growth deserves the blame for the destruction of nature, and it should be displaced. Failing that, I try to work with those companies and help them change the way they think about our resources."],"Yvonne Craig":["Everybody in their own imagination decides what scary is.","When you are doing a show, it can get really dull. You are sitting so long while they set up the lights, then you say a couple of lines, then they tear down the lights again. At least stunts are something that uses your physical energy a great deal.","I haven't collected memorabilia. I am not a person who lives in the past.","I have had strange animals as pets all my life. I was shy growing up, and shy people tend to interact better with animals than people. Animals are direct, not duplicitous."],"Yvonne De Carlo":["I found I had the ability to do comedy. My timing was really inborn.","Men, no matter what their promises, rarely leave their spouses... the louses.","I enjoyed being in 'The Ten Commandments.' That was a great experience - to suddenly become one of those holy people. I was holier than thou.","I was named Margaret Yvonne. 'Margaret' because my mother was very fond of one of the derivatives of the name. She was fascinated at the time by the movie star Baby Peggy, and I suppose she wanted a Baby Peggy of her own.","I guess I lead a double life, and I must admit I'm happy with both.","I'm from Hollywood; I'm too dumb to be nervous about New York.","After I made my hit in 'Salome,' Universal sent me to New York so I could learn to be a proper movie star."],"Yvonne Strahovski":["I loved school, I loved putting on my uniform and doing homework every day. I was one of those good students that the teachers liked. I guess that's got to be a pretty nerdy, geeky part of me.","I've always been a very outdoors sort of girl. I'm more a tomboy than a girly girl.","I feel lucky that I got to work with some of the big legends in town.","I've tried coconut water straight up before, and to me, it's a little funky.","You definitely cannot please everyone at all.","I have a strong dance background. I danced from age five until 18, and that helps a lot. Doing a fight routine is like doing a dance routine.","I remember being at Greenblatt's on Sunset, and some guy just walked straight up to me, and he had some bling on and whatever, and said something about a party down in Malibu and asked if I would jump in his car and go to the party. All I could think was, 'Who are you? I don't know you, and I don't care about how good your car is.'","I think a man is a man, and a man has a hairy chest, so let that be!","We did a lot of high school productions. My first was 'Twelfth Night.' I played Viola. We did 'Much Ado About Nothing' and 'Taming of the Shrew,' and a lot of musicals: 'The Wiz,' 'Bye Bye Birdie,' 'Oliver.'","I just love the culture of Melbourne.","I love watching a good, freaky horror movie. I love it. It's one of my favorite things to do, to go and see at the cinema. Just to tune out and be freaked out.","I've been very physical my whole life. I went out hiking and camping for days in the Australian forest, and when I trained at drama school for three years, we did a whole lot on stage-fighting techniques. And I was a dancer from 5 to 18, so I have a memory for choreography.","I'm pretty gross. When I talk I can be gross and crude.","Sarah is very strong. She's really intelligent and she's very physically capable. I like to put that into my own life as well.","I know that one of the distinguishing things was I looked like I could hold a gun, even though I'd never held one before and I'm physically able to do the martial arts and all that stuff.","I was a tomboy and didn't pay too much attention to my clothes.","I guess I am a bit of a traditionalist.","I'm scared of karaoke. I think if I did have a go to karaoke song, it would be 'Whatta Man' by Salt-n-Pepa.","I don't know if this classifies as a video game, but I have a terrible obsession with Angry Birds.","Most of the film directors expect their actors to want to work fast.","I would love to explore film seeing as I have prominently been on television. It would be nice to change it up and focus on film a little bit.","I was pretty nervous when I met Robert DeNiro. I kind of felt like a kid in a candy store for the first time. I couldn't wipe the grin off of my face. But Bobby DeNiro was really, really sweet and made me feel very comfortable. He's very low-key and just a superstar professional, and totally someone to be admired.","I'm superconscious of not putting chemicals on my skin, like parabens and sulfates.","In general, I would say I'm probably a little more conscious of looking after my skin since I moved to L.A.","Working on camera, your face is your career. But I'm not really one to buy into the pressures. At the end of the day, the job I do, it's more about the art and craft of it. If you're good at what you do, there's a place for you in the industry, no matter what you or your skin look like.","I'm a big believer in exercise. I'm a bigger believer in eating right, which is simply with plenty of fruits and vegetables. I'm not a gym girl, though. I've never had a gym membership.","I don't remember scenes. I'm like, 'Really, we shot that?'","If someone takes you out, and you're wearing sweatpants and a T-shirt, and they take you to a fancy place and you're unprepared, that's bad.","I think it's really important that people become aware of the amount, the mass of animals that are sitting in shelters as opposed to people going out and just buying puppies that are being bred.","It's sad that people will invade someone's privacy - and this is not only regarding someone's private photos - but this goes deep into people's financial privacy, their passwords, their emails, their text messages.","We live in a society where nothing is sacred.","It's nice to see more of those meaty female characters emerging because so often in the industry, it's always about the males.","It's just that I've always been a tomboy, so being thrown into the hot nerd category and the glam thing has been very interesting for me to swallow.","I was acting since I was a kid, going to drama classes and being involved in every school play and musical that I could get my hands on, so it was something that was a part of me from a very early age.","It's, like, your classic journey from a drama school. I went straight to the three-year acting degree, and I waitressed throughout that to support myself and for the first six months after I graduated. Then I started to get commercials here and there, and then I got a couple of roles in Australia and then a more regular role on a TV series.","I'm such a boots-jeans-tops-blazer girl.","If I can't do high kicks or dance in it, then I won't wear it.","I've never been good at meditation, but surfing is the closest I've ever come to that inner something.","I had an addiction to sugar growing up - major, major, major.","There's always chatter about a 'Chuck' movie. So nobody's opposed to it. It's just a matter of getting everything lined up.","I love singing. I love singing at home.","I grew up doing musicals in my childhood at school, along with all the plays I used to be involved in.","It would definitely be fun to do a musical one day.","'24' is such an iconic show.","A lot of my skills came from university. We did everything from stage work to operating the sound boards to marketing shows and more.","My favorite thing about being an actor is that I get to be so many different people in one lifetime. You sort of get to be all of these different characters.","Whether it is television or film, the character on the page has to speak to me.","Carrie-Anne Moss is awesome. I am just going to put that out there.","I landed the female lead role on 'Chuck' within three days of landing in L.A., so it was a little overwhelming, and I definitely felt like I got thrown into the deep end.","I always had dreams as a kid. I definitely sat at home and watched the Oscars every year and got emotional every year at everyone's speeches.","I dreamed big. So it's so great to be living my own dream. I'm working in an industry that I want to work in, and I'm doing something that I love every day. So I feel really lucky to have had so many opportunities.","I grew up being absolutely in love with Tom Hanks. I remember, all the kids had Brad Pitt plastered all over their textbooks, and then I had Tom Hanks plastered over mine.","I was a goody two shoes - a straight-A girl, and I took pride in my studies.","The more gunk I have on my face, the less free I feel.","I don't eat sugar. I eat fruit.","I grew up with horrible skin. I had cystic acne ever since I can remember. I ended up finally listening to those people who say you are what you eat.","Ironically, I'm a really crap liar, even though I do it for a living. I give away too much, somehow. I can't lie!","Filming '24' is just like watching '24.'","I think the Aussieness got beaten out of me back in the States.","I enjoy living in L.A. This is where the work is - or at least generated from - because you fly off and do movies. It's sort of a great way to see the world.","I wanted to honor my heritage and where I came from and keep the name. It was a tough decision to even change the spelling of it phonetically. I wanted to keep it as close to the original as it can be.","I try to keep my private life private and the acting stuff separate.","'The Handmaid's Tale' is a human story, and women's rights are human rights, and it's all about equality, but at the end of the day, it's not equal.","There's something about trying to figure out why someone is doing something that on the outside is horrible - what drives them to do that? What could drive any human being to that kind of behaviour?","I think humans are fascinating in general. We're so weird. We do so many quirky things, and we don't even know it. There's just so many layers upon layers of nuances in everything we do, and the most fun part as an actor is trying to get into all those nuances, whether they're conscious or unconscious.","I was in Toronto when the big Women's March was going on, and I thought, 'Well, I've never been to a protest, and I can't sit this one out, and they're having a gathering here in Toronto, so I may as well go,' and gosh, I didn't expect 60,000 or 65,000 people to be there - it was huge! It was something that I didn't feel I could sit out at all.","I feel like with 'Chuck,' because it was a comedy-based show, it was more cartoon-ish. It was just more playful. We had a lot more fun with it. There was a lot of silliness in there. There were serious moments, as well, and there was a lot of heart in that show, but its baseline was comedy.","We don't really see a lot of comedic moments in '24.' In fact, I haven't seen all of it, but from what I have seen, I don't know if I've ever laughed at anything that anyone has done on '24.'","TV, film, and theater are considered art, and art is a reflection of life. What happens in life includes violence, unfortunately.","I was lucky that I got to do films in between seasons of 'Chuck.'","Funnily enough, 'Chuck' prepared me for '24.'","I'm not a singer. In 'Bye Bye Birdie,' I think I was the sad girl who sits on the park bench during 'Put on a Happy Face.'","I grew up being a dancer, so I was always doing some sort of dance number, like the Tornado in 'The Wiz.'","One of the books I remember reading when I was young and always thought would be a great role to play is Catherine in 'Wuthering Heights.' I like the classics.","I'm a crier. I always cry. I cry at the dumbest things, too. This is why I sort of steer clear of movies and films that I know are going to be depressing. I don't care how many awards they've won - I know they're good. I don't need to watch them, because I don't want to be depressed, and I don't want to cry.","I grew up being scared of the water, which is embarrassing to say as an Australian, but it's true.","Before I started surfing, I don't even know if I would have dived into the water at night alone. It was still scary.","I didn't grow up with a lot of babies in my life because I only grew up with my parents - I didn't have any brothers or sisters - and I didn't have my family close by.","That's one of the things I miss most about Australia - the countryside.","A lot of my friends are in Australia, and it's definitely nice to get back there.","I enjoy a character who sticks to her guns, who's always challenging herself. That's something I can relate to.","Growing up in Australia, space exploration wasn't something I was too aware of.","It's often the death of the show when you break the tension and the two lead characters get together.","I can put my legs behind my head. That's a fun fact that not a lot of people know!"]}
