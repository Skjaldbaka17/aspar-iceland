{"E. B. White":["Everything in life is somewhere else, and you get there in a car.","Prejudice is a great time saver. You can form opinions without having to get the facts.","Writing is an act of faith, not a trick of grammar.","It is not often that someone comes along who is a true friend and a good writer.","We should all do what, in the long run, gives us joy, even if it is only picking grapes or sorting the laundry.","I arise in the morning torn between a desire to improve the world and a desire to enjoy the world. This makes it hard to plan the day.","A good farmer is nothing more nor less than a handy man with a sense of humus.","Be obscure clearly.","Old age is a special problem for me because I've never been able to shed the mental image I have of myself - a lad of about 19.","A writer is like a bean plant - he has his little day, and then gets stringy.","I would feel more optimistic about a bright future for man if he spent less time proving that he can outwit Nature and more time tasting her sweetness and respecting her seniority.","Luck is not something you can mention in the presence of self-made men.","There's no limit to how complicated things can get, on account of one thing always leading to another.","The world is full of people who have never, since childhood, met an open doorway with an open mind.","Genius is more often found in a cracked pot than in a whole one.","There is nothing more likely to start disagreement among people or countries than an agreement.","All we need is a meteorologist who has once been soaked to the skin without ill effect. No one can write knowingly of the weather who walks bent over on wet days.","The world organization debates disarmament in one room and, in the next room, moves the knights and pawns that make national arms imperative.","Analyzing humor is like dissecting a frog. Few people are interested and the frog dies of it.","I see nothing in space as promising as the view from a Ferris wheel.","Democracy is the recurrent suspicion that more than half of the people are right more than half of the time.","The trouble with the profit system has always been that it was highly unprofitable to most people.","Commas in The New Yorker fall with the precision of knives in a circus act, outlining the victim.","I don't know which is more discouraging, literature or chickens.","English usage is sometimes more than mere taste, judgment and education - sometimes it's sheer luck, like getting across the street.","When I was a child people simply looked about them and were moderately happy; today they peer beyond the seven seas, bury themselves waist deep in tidings, and by and large what they see and hear makes them unutterably sad.","To perceive Christmas through its wrappings becomes more difficult with every year.","The critic leaves at curtain fall To find, in starting to review it, He scarcely saw the play at all For starting to review it.","I can only assume that your editorial writer tripped over the First Amendment and thought it was the office cat.","Writing is hard work and bad for the health.","One of the most time-consuming things is to have an enemy.","The time not to become a father is eighteen years before a war.","The only sense that is common in the long run, is the sense of change and we all instinctively avoid it.","Whatever else an American believes or disbelieves about himself, he is absolutely sure he has a sense of humor.","It is easier for a man to be loyal to his club than to his planet; the bylaws are shorter, and he is personally acquainted with the other members.","The terror of the atom age is not the violence of the new power but the speed of man's adjustment to it, the speed of his acceptance.","I have yet to see a piece of writing, political or non-political, that doesn't have a slant. All writing slants the way a writer leans, and no man is born perpendicular, although many men are born upright."],"E. F. Benson":["All the teaching I had ever received had failed to make me apply such intelligence as I was possessed of, directly and vividly: there had never been any sunshine, as regards language, in the earlier grey days of learning, for the sky had always pelted with gerunds and optatives.","Queen Victoria did not regard art, letters, or music as in any way springing from national character: they were something quite apart, elegant decorations resembling a scarf or a bracelet, and in no way expressive of the soul of the country.","Emotionally, I have no picture-book illustrated with memories of my first five years, but externally, I have impressions that possess a haunting vividness comparable only to the texture of dreams, when dreams are tumultuously alive.","Rightly or wrongly, the Victorian considered that there were certain subjects which were not meet for inter-sexual discussion, just as they held that certain processes of the feminine toilet, like the powdering of the nose and the application of lipstick to the mouth, were (if done at all) better done in private.","Queen Victoria was a woman of peerless common sense; her common sense, which is a rare gift at any time, amounted to genius. She had been brought up by her mother with the utmost simplicity, and she retained it to the end, and conducted her public and private life alike by that infallible guide.","Early impressions are like glimpses seen through the window by night when lightning is about.","Romance is a bird that will not sing in every bush, and love-affairs, however devoted the sentiments that inspire them, are often so business-like in the prudence with which they are conducted, that romance is reduced to a mere croaking or a disgusted silence.","Taste is one of the five senses, and the man who tells us with priggish pride that he does not care what he eats is merely boasting of his sad deficiency: he might as well be proud of being deaf or blind, or, owing to a perpetual cold in the head, of being devoid of the sense of smell.","There is no reason to suppose that taste is in any way a lower sense than the other four; a fine palate is as much a gift as an eye that discerns beauty or an ear that appreciates and enjoys subtle harmonies of sound, and we are quite right to value the pleasures that all our senses give us and educate their perceptions.","The greedy man is he who habitually eats too much, knowing that he is injuring his bodily health thereby, and this is a vice to which not the gourmet but the gourmand is a slave.","To most boys with growing limbs and swelling sinews, physical activity is a natural instinct, and there is no need to drive them into the football field or the fives court: they go there because they like it, and there is no need to make games compulsory for them.","What man is there, surrounded though he be with the love of wife and children, who does not retain a memory of the romantic affection of boys for each other? Having felt it, he could scarcely have forgotten it, and if he never felt it, he missed one of the most golden of the prizes of youth, unrecapturable in mature life.","Young gentlemen with literary aspirations usually start a new university magazine, which for wit and pungency is designed to eclipse all such previous efforts, and I was no exception in the matter of this popular gambit."],"E. F. Schumacher":["Eagles come in all shapes and sizes, but you will recognize them chiefly by their attitudes.","Any intelligent fool can make things bigger and more complex... It takes a touch of genius - and a lot of courage to move in the opposite direction.","Infinite growth of material consumption in a finite world is an impossibility.","The printing press is either the greatest blessing or the greatest curse of modern times, sometimes one forgets which it is.","If, however, economic ambitions are good servants, they are bad masters.","An attitude to life which seeks fulfillment in the single-minded pursuit of wealth - in short, materialism - does not fit into this world, because it contains within itself no limiting principle, while the environment in which it is placed is strictly limited.","Few can contemplate without a sense of exhilaration the splendid achievements of practical energy and technical skill, which, from the latter part of the seventeenth century, were transforming the face of material civilization, and of which England was the daring, if not too scrupulous, pioneer.","The system of nature, of which man is a part, tends to be self-balancing, self-adjusting, self-cleansing. Not so with technology.","Never let an inventor run a company. You can never get him to stop tinkering and bring something to market.","Many people love in themselves what they hate in others.","It might be said that it is the ideal of the employer to have production without employees and the ideal of the employee is to have income without work.","You can either read something many times in order to be assured that you got it all, or else you can define your purpose and use techniques which will assure that you have met it and gotten what you need."],"E. Franklin Frazier":["The closer a Negro got to the ballot box, the more he looked like a rapist.","Education in the past has been too much inspiration and too little information.","America faces a new race that has awakened.","Educational institutes can no longer be prizes in church politics or furnish berths for failure in other walks of life."],"E. G. Marshall":["My full name is E.G. Marshall. I am known by no other.","I used to watch movies - silent movies - and stock companies and theater whenever I could.","I try to think what the character is thinking. Then, hopefully, I begin to feel it. I act and react not because I'm recalling a dog killed by a fire engine, but because I'm concentrating on what the character is going through."],"E. Joseph Cossman":["The best way to remember your wife's birthday is to forget it once.","Obstacles are things a person sees when he takes his eyes off his goal.","Since it is not granted to us to live long, let us transmit to posterity some memorial that we have at least lived.","The greatest power is often simple patience.","I believe the classified section of a newspaper - especially the 'Business Opportunities' column - can tell you more about your city 'business-wise' than any other publication.","Starting in business is like getting married... there is really no good time and no bad time. The time is now.","Middle age is when your broad mind and narrow waist begin to change places.","Drive-in banks were established so most of the cars today could see their real owners.","You can have the best product in the world, you can have the best motivation in the world, you can have best education in the world, you can have all the money in the world - but if you don't have direction, you'll never go anywhere.","The criteria, the only rule you should follow - the only rule - is to never touch a product or service unless, every time it is sold, part of the profit has to come back to you.","Our business in life is not to get ahead of others, but to get ahead of ourselves.","If you want to test your memory, try to recall what you were worrying about one year ago today.","Do not quit! Hundreds of times I have watched people throw in the towel at the one-yard line while someone else comes along and makes a fortune by just going that extra yard.","Square meals often make round people.","'Salaryitis' is when you become so accustomed to that salary that you no longer have the gumption to pull out of the rut and strike out on your own. It destroys the nerve of ambitious, imaginative men, and bowing to it has meant sure defeat for more people than any other sickness, mental or physical.","Expose yourself to the products and promotions of other manufacturers, and your own field of new ideas will greatly increase.","Many past products advertised in old publications can be profitably promoted all over again. Sometimes, just by giving them a new twist or modern application, you'll hit a real winner.","For products with revision possibilities, there is no better source available than a company going out of business!","Your goals should be to have the system work for you instead of your working for the system! Be the hammer - not the nail!","This country is conducive to making money. Once you learn this lesson and make your first deal, you will really appreciate the tools available to you in the United States, the tools that will help you 'boot-strap' yourself into a large income.","Making $30,000 on my first business deal was exciting, but not as exciting as the sudden knowledge that I did not have to work for anyone again.","When I returned to the United States after three years of World War II service, my total assets consisted of one wife, one small daughter, $276 in the bank, and an idea. The idea was for an export business to supply items badly needed everywhere in Europe.","If you try to make money doing something you're not enjoying, it's a hard way to make money.","If you are ready to put a product or service on the market, look at that product or service and see how you can test it inexpensively. Keep in mind, you'll only need one; you don't need 1,000 to get the answer.","A lot of magic happens when you put out a publicity release. I have launched many products with the money I got back from my publicity release."],"E. L. Doctorow":["Writing is an exploration. You start from nothing and learn as you go.","Good writing is supposed to evoke sensation in the reader - not the fact that it is raining, but the feeling of being rained upon.","Writing is like driving at night in the fog. You can only see as far as your headlights, but you can make the whole trip that way.","I like commas. I detest semi-colons - I don't think they belong in a story. And I gave up quotation marks long ago. I found I didn't need them, they were fly-specks on the page.","We're always attracted to the edges of what we are, out by the edges where it's a little raw and nervy.","When you're writing a book, you don't really think about it critically. You don't want to know too well what you're doing. First, you write the book, then you find the justification for it.","I began to ask two questions while I was reading a book that excited me: not only what was going to happen next, but how is this done? How is it that these words on the page make me feel the way I'm feeling? This is the line of inquiry that I think happens in a child's mind, without him even knowing he has aspirations as a writer.","It's like driving a car at night. You never see further than your headlights, but you can make the whole trip that way.","There is no longer any such thing as fiction or nonfiction; there's only narrative.","Writing is a socially acceptable form of schizophrenia.","I discovered Einstein said the same thing about his celebrated theories of relativity that writers say about their work when he said he didn't have any feelings of personal possession of these ideas. Once they were out there, they came from somewhere else. And that's exactly the feeling when you write. You don't feel possessive about it.","The historian will tell you what happened. The novelist will tell you what it felt like.","One of the things I had to learn as a writer was to trust the act of writing. To put myself in the position of writing to find out what I was writing. I did that with 'World's Fair,' as with all of them. The inventions of the book come as discoveries.","Here's how it goes: I'm up at the stroke of 10 or 10:30. I have breakfast and read the papers, and then it's lunchtime. Then maybe a little nap after lunch and out to the gym, and before I know it, it's time to have a drink.","Planning to write is not writing. Outlining, researching, talking to people about what you're doing, none of that is writing. Writing is writing.","History is the present. That's why every generation writes it anew. But what most people think of as history is its end product, myth.","I've outlasted many marriages at Random House.","Writers are not just people who sit down and write. They hazard themselves. Every time you compose a book your composition of yourself is at stake.","I try to avoid experience if I can. Most experience is bad.","Like art and politics, gangsterism is a very important avenue of assimilation into society.","The writer isn't made in a vacuum. Writers are witnesses. The reason we need writers is because we need witnesses to this terrifying century.","In the twentieth century one of the most personal relationships to have developed is that of the person and the state. It's become a fact of life that governments have become very intimate with people, most always to their detriment.","I thought I would lose, so I didn't prepare a speech.","I can walk into a bookstore and hand over my credit card and they don't know who the hell I am. Maybe that says something about bookstore clerks.","Writing is immensely difficult. The short forms especially.","One of the things I had to learn as a writer was to trust the act of writing. To put myself in the position of writing to find out what I was writing.","Each book tends to have its own identity rather than the author's. It speaks from itself rather than you. Each book is unlike the others because you are not bringing the same voice to every book. I think that keeps you alive as a writer.","My theory about why Hemingway killed himself is that he heard his own voice; that he reached the point where he couldn't write without feeling he was repeating himself. That's the worst thing that can happen to a writer.","A new reader shouldn't be able to find you in your work, though someone who's read more may begin to.","I'm not the sort of writer who can walk into a party and take a look around, see who's sleeping with whom and go home and write a novel about society. It's not the way I work.","Somewhere along the line the rhythms and tonalities of music elided in my brain with the sounds that words make and the rhythm that sentences have.","A period of time is as much an organising principle for a work of fiction as a sense of place. You can do geography, as Faulkner did, or you can dwell on a particular period. It provides the same framework.","Things that appear on the front page of the newspaper as 'fact' are far more dangerous than the games played by a novelist, and can lead to wars.","I did have a feeling then that the culture of factuality was so dominating that storytelling had lost all its authority.","When you're working well, you don't do research. Whatever you need comes to you.","When I'm writing, I like to seal everything off and face the wall, not to look outside the window. The only way out is through the sentences.","Movies are too literal.","Congress is so beholden to the money that any solution in the general interest will be frustrated and subverted by the corporate interests who feel they will be damaged by progress, fair play and justice.","I don't think anything I've written has been done in under six or eight drafts. Usually it takes me a few years to write a book. 'World's Fair' was an exception. It seemed to be a particularly fluent book as it came. I did it in seven months. I think what happened in that case is that God gave me a bonus book.","Books are acts of composition: you compose them. You make music: the music is called fiction.","I like to think of myself as an unmediated novelist - or perhaps a national novelist.","From my undergraduate days, I've always been interested in the major philosophical questions that don't seem to have an answer that everyone agrees on.","My books start almost before I realise it. Once in a while, some accident causes an idea to rise to the surface and say: 'now.'","People come out of the mid-west and go to the Ivy League. I kind of reversed the direction.","Suffering isn't a moral endowment. People don't always do well under duress, and it seemed to me to be truer to a fellow in that situation to make him angry.","There are two books that impressed me when I was very young. One was 'The Adventures of Augie March' - the idea of having something so generous, and so adventurous and improvisatory. The other was 'The U.S.A. Trilogy,' by John Dos Passos.","My father was the proprietor of a music shop on Forty-third Street, where many of the finest performers and musicians of the day would come to shop. He knew the classical repertoire inside out.","I have a number of vices, one of which is moderation.","In fiction, you know, there are no borders. You can go anywhere.","I got married very early, and in no time at all, we had three children. And it seemed to me I had an obligation to support them.","I get intrigued by a first lin and I write to find out why it means something to me. You make discoveries just the way the reader does, so you're simultaneously the writer and the reader.","I started on computers with 'Billy Bathgate,' a little orange screen with black letters. I thought it was really cool, but it actually slowed me up for a while because it's so easy to revise, I tended to stay on the same page. I've learned to discipline myself.","Washington is designed not to solve problems. Congress is so beholden to the money that any solution in the general interest will be frustrated and subverted by the corporate interests who feel they will be damaged by progress, fair play and justice.","Obama is a great man who's just beginning to understand the realities. And I'm not just saying that because he reads my books. I would have voted for him anyway.","It seems to me that in literature, books have always been answers to other books.","If we ever find out how the brain works, with all its complexity, then we will be able to build a machine that has consciousness. And if that happens, that is a road to planetary disaster because everything we've thought about ourselves, since the Bronze Age, the Bible, all of that will be gone.","The important thing is not to be too comfortable when you're writing. Noise in the street? That's good. The computer goes down? That's good. All these things are good. It has to be a little bit of a struggle.","The nature of good fiction is that it dwells in ambiguity.","My sense of what a book should be has changed so radically. I like to think for the better.","To have the regard of one's peers is immensely moving."],"E. L. James":["Women basically want the same thing - a good passionate story, a great fantasy - and for our partners to do the laundry and the washing up.","All a writer wants is to be read, and people are so flattering and lovely. I mean, there are witches out there as well. But most are so kind.","God forbid that women have fantasies.","Write for yourself. That's it. And write every day.","Yes, I'm a 'Twi-hard.' I became obsessed. Absolutely obsessed. I didn't watch television, I didn't go to the cinema. My friends would ring and say: 'What are you doing?' And I would say: 'I've just got to finish this chapter.'","Once you're in charge of your job, your house, your children, getting the food on the table, doing all of this, all of the time, it'd be nice for someone else to be in charge for a bit maybe.","I really like clever men who challenge you.","I came up with a story and I wrote it.","I'm not a great writer.","I'm looking forward to getting back to my house and my Ugg boots and not washing sometimes, and getting back to writing.","I think women love to read love stories.","I've set the bar quite high in terms of storytelling.","If you've been married for 400 years, as I have, it's nice to experience first love again and you can vicariously through a book.","I think women love a passionate love story.","I don't watch much British television at all. I mean, it's ironic because I used to work in it for years.","I've worked in television all my life, but really I've always wanted to work in the movies.","Everyone's clamoring for the fourth book in the 'Fifty Shades' trilogy, which makes me laugh. Just the part of 'a fourth book in trilogy' that makes me laugh, not the clamoring for the next book.","I hate having my photograph taken.","I see myself as a story teller.","I value my anonymity. I'm happy to come in on the tube or the train and watch other people reading 'Fifty Shades.'","I'm a bit of a control freak.","I never set out to do this - getting to No. 1 in the 'New York Times' bestseller list wasn't even a pipedream."],"E. L. Konigsburg":["I think it's important to experience kindness so that you can experience it more in the future. I believe that patterns of emotional behavior are set down before adolescence. And I think that if you have not observed kindness, you will not recognize it. You have to experience kindness in order to be kind.","Growing up in a small town gives you two things: a sense of place and a feeling of self-consciousness - self-consciousness about one's education and exposure, both of which tend to be limited. On the other hand, limited possibilities also mean creating your own options.","I was the first one in my family to go away to college. I came from a small town where there was no guidance in the high school at all. It was a mill town, and I never knew anyone who made their living from the arts. When you did go away to college, you went away to be something - an engineer, or a teacher, or a chemist.","When I was in college at Carnegie Mellon, I wanted to be a chemist. So I became one. I worked in a laboratory and went to graduate school at the University of Pittsburgh. Then I taught science at a private girls' school. I had three children and waited until all three were in school before I started writing.","Characters are so important to a story that they actually decide where the story is going. When I write, I know my characters. I know how things are going to end, and I know some important incidents along the way.","I was born in New York City. But my family moved when I was still an infant. Except for a year and half when we lived in Youngstown, Ohio, I grew up in small towns in Pennsylvania. I graduated from high school in Farrell, Pennsylvania.","I get ideas for my books from people I know and what happens to them, from places I've been and what happens to me, and from things I read.","After I won the Newbery Medal for 'From the Mixed-up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler,' children all over the world let me know that they liked books that take them to unusual places where they meet unusual people.","Readers let me know that they like books that have more to them than meets the eye. Had they not let me know that, I never would have written 'The View From Saturday.'","I think most of us are outsiders. And I think that's good because it makes you question things.","When I began writing in the mid-1960s, I thought it was not important for readers to know whether I was male or female. Also, I was a great admirer of E.B. White, so I may have thought that it would bring me luck to submit my first manuscript as 'E.L.' But if I were starting out today, I would use my first name.","The essential problems remain the same... The kids I write about are asking for the same things I wanted. They want two contradictory things. They want to be the same as everyone else, and they want to be different from everyone else. They want acceptance for both.","Art comes from a visceral need and is usually generated by something I have seen; writing comes from something that happens in my head and my heart."],"E. M. Forster":["Unless we remember we cannot understand.","We cast a shadow on something wherever we stand.","We must be willing to let go of the life we have planned, so as to have the life that is waiting for us.","What is the good of your stars and trees, your sunrise and the wind, if they do not enter into our daily lives?","The four characteristics of humanism are curiosity, a free mind, belief in good taste, and belief in the human race.","Ideas are fatal to caste.","The king died and then the queen died is a story. The king died, and then queen died of grief is a plot.","So, two cheers for Democracy: one because it admits variety and two because it permits criticism.","Nonsense and beauty have close connections.","Spoon feeding in the long run teaches us nothing but the shape of the spoon.","It is the vice of a vulgar mind to be thrilled by bigness.","I am sure that if the mothers of various nations could meet, there would be no more wars.","Love is always being given where it is not required.","I distrust Great Men. They produce a desert of uniformity around them and often a pool of blood too, and I always feel a little man's pleasure when they come a cropper.","We are willing enough to praise freedom when she is safely tucked away in the past and cannot be a nuisance. In the present, amidst dangers whose outcome we cannot foresee, we get nervous about her, and admit censorship.","What is wonderful about great literature is that it transforms the man who reads it towards the condition of the man who wrote.","Charm, in most men and nearly all women, is a decoration.","The sadness of the incomplete, the sadness that is often Life, but should never be Art.","Railway termini are our gates to the glorious and the unknown. Through them we pass out into adventure and sunshine, to them, alas! we return.","One must be fond of people and trust them if one is not to make a mess of life.","The fact is we can only love what we know personally. And we cannot know much. In public affairs, in the rebuilding of civilization, something less dramatic and emotional is needed, namely tolerance.","It is my fate and perhaps my temperament to sign agreements with fools.","At the side of the everlasting why, is a yes, and a yes, and a yes.","Only people who have been allowed to practise freedom can have the grown-up look in their eyes.","If I had to choose between betraying my country and betraying my friend, I hope I should have the guts to betray my country.","No man can be an agnostic who has a sense of humour.","Beethoven's Fifth Symphony is the most sublime noise that has ever penetrated into the ear of man.","History develops, art stands still.","Oxford is Oxford: not a mere receptacle for youth, like Cambridge. Perhaps it wants its inmates to love it rather than to love one another.","I have only got down on to paper, really, three types of people: the person I think I am, the people who irritate me, and the people I'd like to be.","Life is easy to chronicle, but bewildering to practice.","Beauty ought to look a little surprised: it is the emotion that best suits her face. The beauty who does not look surprised, who accepts her position as her due - she reminds us too much of a prima donna.","People have their own deaths as well as their own lives, and even if there is nothing beyond death, we shall differ in our nothingness.","Tolerance is a very dull virtue. It is boring. Unlike love, it has always had a bad press. It is negative. It merely means putting up with people, being able to stand things.","The only books that influence us are those for which we are ready, and which have gone a little farther down our particular path than we have yet got ourselves.","I am so used to seeing the sort of play which deals with one man and two women. They do not leave me with the feeling I have made a full theatrical meal they do not give me the experience of the multiplicity of life.","We are not concerned with the very poor. They are unthinkable, and only to be approached by the statistician or the poet.","Most quarrels are inevitable at the time; incredible afterwards.","There is something majestic in the bad taste of Italy.","One is certain of nothing but the truth of one's own emotions.","Love and understand the Italians, for the people are more marvellous than the land.","Those who prepared for all the emergencies of life beforehand may equip themselves at the expense of joy.","Only a struggle twists sentimentality and lust together into love.","The sort of poetry I seek resides in objects man can't touch.","How can I know what I think till I see what I say?","Only a writer who has the sense of evil can make goodness readable.","Reverence is fatal to literature.","To make us feel small in the right way is a function of art; men can only make us feel small in the wrong way.","Faith, to my mind, is a stiffening process, a sort of mental starch.","Works of art, in my opinion, are the only objects in the material universe to possess internal order, and that is why, though I don't believe that only art matters, I do believe in Art for Art's sake.","The final test for a novel will be our affection for it, as it is the test of our friends, and of anything else which we cannot define.","America is rather like life. You can usually find in it what you look for. It will probably be interesting, and it is sure to be large.","There lies at the back of every creed something terrible and hard for which the worshipper may one day be required to suffer.","One always tends to overpraise a long book, because one has got through it.","At night, when the curtains are drawn and the fire flickers, my books attain a collective dignity.","The historian must have some conception of how men who are not historians behave. Otherwise he will move in a world of the dead. He can only gain that conception through personal experience, and he can only use his personal experiences when he is a genius.","Very notable was his distinction between coarseness and vulgarity, coarseness, revealing something; vulgarity, concealing something.","Creative writers are always greater than the causes that they represent.","A poem is true if it hangs together. Information points to something else. A poem points to nothing but itself.","Logic! Good gracious! What rubbish!","Think before you speak is criticism's motto; speak before you think, creation's.","There is much good luck in the world, but it is luck. We are none of us safe. We are children, playing or quarrelling on the line.","We are all like Scheherazade's husband, in that we want to know what happens next.","If there is on earth a house with many mansions, it is the house of words.","The more highly public life is organized the lower does its morality sink.","The English countryside, its growth and its destruction, is a genuine and tragic theme.","Paganism is infectious, more infectious than diphtheria or piety.","I have no mystic faith in the people. I have in the individual.","The main facts in human life are five: birth, food, sleep, love and death.","The people I respect most behave as if they were immortal and as if society was eternal.","One of the evils of money is that it tempts us to look at it rather than at the things that it buys.","Surely the only sound foundation for a civilization is a sound state of mind.","No one is India.","Be soft, even if you stand to get squashed.","Death destroys a man, but the idea of death saves him.","I'm a holy man minus the holiness.","I am certainly an ought and not a must.","One marvels why the middle classes still insist on so much discomfort for their children at such expense to themselves.","I never could get on with representative individuals but people who existed on their own account and with whom it might therefore be possible to be friends.","Two cheers for Democracy; one because it admits variety, and two because it permits criticism.","Liking one person is an extra reason for liking another.","England has always been disinclined to accept human nature.","For our vanity is such that we hold our own characters immutable, and we are slow to acknowledge that they have changed, even for the better.","Letters have to pass two tests before they can be classed as good: they must express the personality both of the writer and of the recipient.","The woman who can't influence her husband to vote the way she wants ought to be ashamed of herself.","But nothing in India is identifiable, the mere asking of a question causes it to disappear or to merge in something else.","The work of art assumes the existence of the perfect spectator, and is indifferent to the fact that no such person exists.","Either life entails courage, or it ceases to be life."],"E. O. Wilson":["Nature holds the key to our aesthetic, intellectual, cognitive and even spiritual satisfaction.","You are capable of more than you know. Choose a goal that seems right for you and strive to be the best, however hard the path. Aim high. Behave honorably. Prepare to be alone at times, and to endure failure. Persist! The world needs all you can give.","If all mankind were to disappear, the world would regenerate back to the rich state of equilibrium that existed ten thousand years ago. If insects were to vanish, the environment would collapse into chaos.","When you have seen one ant, one bird, one tree, you have not seen them all.","We are drowning in information, while starving for wisdom. The world henceforth will be run by synthesizers, people able to put together the right information at the right time, think critically about it, and make important choices wisely.","We should preserve every scrap of biodiversity as priceless while we learn to use it and come to understand what it means to humanity.","Ants have the most complicated social organization on earth next to humans.","If those committed to the quest fail, they will be forgiven. When lost, they will find another way. The moral imperative of humanism is the endeavor alone, whether successful or not, provided the effort is honorable and failure memorable.","Destroying rainforest for economic gain is like burning a Renaissance painting to cook a meal.","There is no better high than discovery.","Our brain is mapping the world. Often that map is distorted, but it's a map with constant immediate sensory input.","I'm very much a Christian in ideals and ethics, especially in terms of belief in fairness, a deep set obligation to others, and the virtues of charity, tolerance and generosity that we associate with traditional Christian teaching.","Because the living environment is what really sustains us.","Political ideology can corrupt the mind, and science.","A very Faustian choice is upon us: whether to accept our corrosive and risky behavior as the unavoidable price of population and economic growth, or to take stock of ourselves and search for a new environmental ethic.","It's always been a great survival value for people to believe they belong to a superior tribe. That's just in human relationships.","Every kid has a bug period... I never grew out of mine.","The education of women is the best way to save the environment.","Religious belief itself is an adaptation that has evolved because we're hard-wired to form tribalistic religions.","In 2010, my two Harvard mathematician colleagues and I dismantled kin-selection theory, which was the reigning theory of the origin of altruism at the time.","One thing I did was grow up as an ardent naturalist. I never grew out of my bug period.","Change will come slowly, across generations, because old beliefs die hard even when demonstrably false.","I had in mind a message, although I hope it doesn't intrude too badly, persuading Americans, and especially Southerners, of the critical importance of land and our vanishing natural environment and wildlife.","The one process now going on that will take millions of years to correct is the loss of genetic and species diversity by the destruction of natural habitats. This is the folly our descendants are least likely to forgive us.","If we were to wipe out insects alone on this planet, the rest of life and humanity with it would mostly disappear from the land. Within a few months.","Ants are the dominant insects of the world, and they've had a great impact on habitats almost all over the land surface of the world for more than 50-million years.","I've found that good dialogue tells you not only what people are saying or how they're communicating but it tells you a great deal - by dialect and tone, content and circumstance - about the quality of the character.","Companies that are willing to share, to withhold in order to further the growth of the company, willing to try to get a better atmosphere through a demonstration of democratic principles, fairness and cooperation, a better product, those will win in the end.","Ants make up two-thirds of the biomass of all the insects. There are millions of species of organisms and we know almost nothing about them.","Every major religion today is a winner in the Darwinian struggle waged among cultures, and none ever flourished by tolerating its rivals.","In many environments, take away the ants and there would be partial collapses in many of the land ecosystems.","Blind faith, no matter how passionately expressed, will not suffice. Science for its part will test relentlessly every assumption about the human condition.","An individual ant, even though it has a brain about a millionth of a size of a human being's, can learn a maze; the kind we use is a simple rat maze in a laboratory. They can learn it about one-half as fast as a rat.","Perhaps the time has come to cease calling it the 'environmentalist' view, as though it were a lobbying effort outside the mainstream of human activity, and to start calling it the real-world view.","For me, the peculiar qualities of faith are a logical outcome of this level of biological organization.","When you get into the whole field of exploring, probably 90 percent of the kinds of organisms, plants, animals and especially microorganisms and tiny invertebrate animals are unknown. Then you realize that we live on a relatively unexplored plan.","Well, let me tell you, ants are the dominant insects. They make up as much as a quarter of the biomass of all insects in the world. They are the principal predators. They're the cemetery workers.","The human mind evolved to believe in the gods. It did not evolve to believe in biology.","It's obvious that the key problem facing humanity in the coming century is how to bring a better quality of life - for 8 billion or more people - without wrecking the environment entirely in the attempt.","Once I feel I'm right, I have enjoyed provoking.","Of course, there is no reconciliation between the theory of evolution by natural selection and the traditional religious view of the origin of the human mind.","The ant world is a tumult, a noisy world of pheromones being passed back and forth.","People respect nonfiction but they read novels.","Real biologists who actually do the research will tell you that they almost never find a phenomenon, no matter how odd or irrelevant it looks when they first see it, that doesn't prove to serve a function. The outcome itself may be due to small accidents of evolution.","Jehovah had nothing to say to Moses and the others about the care of the planet. He had plenty to say about tribal loyalty and conquest.","The essence of humanity's spiritual dilemma is that we evolved genetically to accept one truth and discovered another. Is there a way to erase the dilemma, to resolve the contradictions between the transcendentalist and the empiricist world views?","The historical circumstance of interest is that the tropical rain forests have persisted over broad parts of the continents since their origins as stronghold of the flowering plants 150 million years ago.","Even as empiricism is winning the mind, transcendentalism continues to win the heart.","There doesn't seem to be any other way of creating the next green revolution without GMOs.","The human juggernaut is permanently eroding Earth's ancient biosphere.","What we need is an electronic encyclopedia of life, with one page for each species. On each page is given everything known about that species.","But once the ants and termites jumped the high barrier that prevents the vast variety of evolving animal groups from becoming fully social, they dominated the world.","The biological evolutionary perception of life and of human qualities is radically different from that of traditional religion, whether it's Southern Baptist or Islam or any religion that believes in a supernatural supervalance over humanity.","So in my freshman year at the University of Alabama, learning the literature on evolution, what was known about it biologically, just gradually transformed me by taking me out of literalism and increasingly into a more secular, scientific view of the world.","The world depends on fungi, because they are major players in the cycling of materials and energy around the world.","Ants are the leading removers of dead creatures on the land. And the rest of life is substantially dependent upon them.","All three of the Abrahamic religions were born and nurtured in arid, disturbed environments.","We have decommissioned natural selection and must now look deep within ourselves and decide what we wish to become.","Science and religion are the two most powerful forces in the world. Having them at odds... is not productive.","It's the technique, I think, of writing a novel that is difficult for a nonfiction writer.","If history and science have taught us anything, it is that passion and desire are not the same as truth.","I had reached a point in my career in which I was ready to try something new in my writing, and the idea of a novel has always been in the back of my mind.","I doubt that most people with short-term thinking love the natural world enough to save it.","It's like having astronomy without knowing where the stars are.","Sometimes a concept is baffling not because it is profound but because it is wrong.","True character arises from a deeper well than religion.","Without a trace of irony I can say I have been blessed with brilliant enemies. I owe them a great debt, because they redoubled my energies and drove me in new directions.","Theology made no provision for evolution. The biblical authors had missed the most important revelation of all! Could it be that they were not really privy to the thoughts of God?","People need a sacred narrative. They must have a sense of larger purpose, in one form or another, however intellectualized. They will find a way to keep ancestral spirits alive.","To the extent that philosophical positions both confuse us and close doors to further inquiry, they are likely to be wrong.","By any reasonable measure of achievement, the faith of the Enlightenment thinkers in science was justified.","America in particular imposes an horrendous burden on the world. We have this wonderful standard of living but it comes at enormous cost.","The two major challenges for the 21st century are to improve the economic situation of the majority and save as much of the planet as we can.","The variety of genes on the planet in viruses exceeds, or is likely to exceed, that in all of the rest of life combined.","Ideas emerge when a part of the real or imagined world is studied for its own sake.","It's always been a dream of mine, of exploring the living world, of classifying all the species and finding out what makes up the biosphere.","Individual versus group selection results in a mix of altruism and selfishness, of virtue and sin, among the members of a society.","We ought to recognize that religious strife is not the consequence of differences among people. It's about conflicts between creation stories.","I see no way out of the problems that organized religion and tribalism create other than humans just becoming more honest and fully aware of themselves.","I was a senior in high school when I decided I wanted to work on ants as a career. I just fell in love with them, and have never regretted it.","What's been gratifying is to live long enough to see molecular biology and evolutionary biology growing toward each other and uniting in research efforts.","I grew up as a Southern Baptist with strict adherence to the Bible, which I read as a youngster.","In addition I wanted to write a Southern novel, because I'm a Southerner.","Religious beliefs evolved by group-selection, tribe competing against tribe, and the illogic of religions is not a weakness but their essential strength.","Competing is intense among humans, and within a group, selfish individuals always win. But in contests between groups, groups of altruists always beat groups of selfish individuals.","In my heart, I'm an Alabaman who went up north to work.","We don't need to clear the 4 to 6 percent of the Earth's surface remaining in tropical rain forests, with most of the animal and plant species living there.","The work on ants has profoundly affected the way I think about humans.","I tend to believe that religious dogma is a consequence of evolution.","I thought perhaps it should be recognized that religious people, including fundamentalists, are quite intelligent, many of them are highly educated, and they should be treated with complete respect.","'The Creation' presents an argument for saving biological diversity on Earth. Most of the book is for as broad an audience as possible.","But I feel music has a very important role in ritual activity, and that being able to join in musical activity, along with dancing, could have been necessary at a very early stage of human culture.","Secular humanists can sit around and talk about their love of humanity, but it doesn't stack up against a two-millennium-old funeral high mass.","In some ways, I had a traditional 'old South' upbringing, meaning that I spent some time in a military school, and acquired an inoculum of the military ethic that is still with me today: honor, duty, loyalty."],"E. P. Thompson":["I have become a prisoner of the peace movement. But you can't say that the termination is coming and then say that you are going back to your own garden to dig.","I think you will find scientists that think like you in Germany and Britain, and you will find politicians that think like Weinberger. I think the most bellicose ruling group in the Western world at the moment is the British.","I don't care tuppence whether I'm forced into a leadership position or not. I'd much sooner not.","For two decades the state has been taking liberties, and these liberties were once ours.","I am convinced that we are in a terminal process.","I will hear no talk that there are no intermediate-range weapons on the NATO side.","There are no European voices at Geneva, there are no European voices at START.","Could I interrupt here, because there is an alternative explanation, which you are particularly well placed to examine. You know the argument that it is the alchemists in the laboratories who invent the sweet new kits.","The missiles come first, and the justifications come second.","You know as a scientist that both were developed completely independently of each other in the laboratories. And only afterward were the political situations contrived out of which they could be justified.","I think that the U.S. does have this very much more open attitude, and I admire it very much and I think it's very important to the world. But the information and the discussion sometimes come too late, after the effective decision has been made.","The readings of Soviet society are as many as the experts you speak to. In my view, it's a society that is overdue for measures of democratization and organization.","The talk about balance, nuclear balance, seems to me to be metaphysical and doesn't seem to be real at all."],"E. Stanley Jones":["The conscious mind determines the actions, the unconscious mind determines the reactions; and the reactions are just as important as the actions.","Our actions are the results of our intentions and our intelligence.","If the Holy Spirit can take over the subconscious with our consent and cooperation, then we have almighty Power working at the basis of our lives, then we can do anything we ought to do, go anywhere we ought to go, and be anything we ought to be.","At the cross God wrapped his heart in flesh and blood and let it be nailed to the cross for our redemption.","Continuing a Lenten series on prayer: Prayer is co-operation with God. It is the purest exercise of the faculties God has given us - an exercise that links these faculties with the Maker to work out the intentions He had in mind in their creation.","Prayer is aligning ourselves with the purposes of God.","We grow small trying to be great.","Prayer is commission. Out of the quietness with God, power is generated that turns the spiritual machinery of the world. When you pray, you begin to feel the sense of being sent, that the divine compulsion is upon you.","To pass from estrangement from God to be a son of God is the basic fact of conversion. That altered relationship with God gives you an altered relationship with yourself, with your brother man, with nature, with the universe.","In conversion you are not attached primarily to an order, nor to an institution, nor a movement, nor a set of beliefs, nor a code of action - you are attached primarily to a Person, and secondarily to these other things.","Character is supreme in life, hence Jesus stood supreme in the supreme thing - so supreme that, when we think of the ideal, we do not add virtue to virtue, but think of Jesus Christ, so that the standard of human life is no longer a code but a character.","Some have said that the power of a Redeemer would depend upon two things: first, upon the richness of the self that was given; and second, upon the depths of the giving. Friend and foe alike are agreed on the question of the character of Jesus Christ.","Being born in a Christian home does not make you a Christian.","Victorious living does not mean freedom from temptation, nor does it mean freedom from mistakes.","Whatever our creed, we stand with admiration before the sublime character of Jesus.","You cease to move into yourself, away from others. You give up your antagonism. You begin to move toward others in love. God moved toward you in gracious, outgoing love, and you move toward others in that same outgoing love.","God, to redeem us at the deepest portion of our nature - the urge to love and be loved - must reveal His nature in an incredible and impossible way. He must reveal it at a cross.","Here he tells us that the new birth is first of all 'not of blood'. You don't get it through the blood stream, through heredity. Your parents can give you much, but they cannot give you this.","In the ordinary church, it is suppressed by respectability, by a desire to appear better than we really are.","Life is supplied with a basic adequacy.","Our intentions may be very good, but, because the intelligence is limited, the action may turn out to be a mistake - a mistake, but not necessarily a sin, for sin comes out of a wrong intention.","Prayer is commitment. We don't merely co-operate with God with certain things held back within. We, the total person, co-operate. This means that co-operation equals committment.","Prayer means that the total you is praying. Your whole being reaches out to God, and God reaches down to you.","The action carries a sense of incompleteness and frustration, but not of guilt. Victorious living does not mean perfect living in the sense of living without flaw, but it does mean adequate living, and that can be consistent with many mistakes.","We are personalities in the making, limited, and grappling with things too high for us. Obviously we, at very best, will make many mistakes, but these mistakes need not be sins.","When the depths are upheld by the Holy Spirit, then the reaction is Christian.","When we think of the ideal, we do not add virtue to virtue, but think of Jesus Christ, so that the standard of human life is no longer a code, but a character."],"E. T. A. Hoffmann":["Once you are dancing with the devil, the prettiest capers won't help you.","How prone poor Humanity is to dam up the minutest remnants of its freedom, and build an artificial roof to prevent it looking up to the clear blue sky.","Think of the wonderful circles in which our whole being moves and from which we cannot escape no matter how we try. The circler circles in these circles.","Not a single man on earth knows from his own experience the how and where of his birth, only from tradition, which is often very uncertain.","It is useless to contend with the irresistible power of Time, which goes on continually creating by a process of constant destruction.","It is nearly always the most improbable things that really come to pass.","Is it not in the most absolute simplicity that real genius plies its pinions the most wonderfully?","Boys should not play with weapons more dangerous than they understand."],"E. T. Bell":["The mistakes and unresolved difficulties of the past in mathematics have always been the opportunities of its future.","'Obvious' is the most dangerous word in mathematics.","Guided only by their feeling for symmetry, simplicity, and generality, and an indefinable sense of the fitness of things, creative mathematicians now, as in the past, are inspired by the art of mathematics rather than by any prospect of ultimate usefulness.","Euclid taught me that without assumptions there is no proof. Therefore, in any argument, examine the assumptions.","Fashion as King is sometimes a very stupid ruler.","I have always hated machinery, and the only machine I ever understood was a wheelbarrow, and that but imperfectly.","If indeed, as Hilbert asserted, mathematics is a meaningless game played with meaningless marks on paper, the only mathematical experience to which we can refer is the making of marks on paper.","It is the perennial youthfulness of mathematics itself which marks it off with a disconcerting immortality from the other sciences.","Out of fifty mathematical papers presented in brief at such a meeting, it is a rare mathematician indeed who really understands what more than half a dozen are about.","Science makes no pretension to eternal truth or absolute truth.","The longer mathematics lives the more abstract - and therefore, possibly also the more practical - it becomes.","The pursuit of pretty formulas and neat theorems can no doubt quickly degenerate into a silly vice, but so can the quest for austere generalities which are so very general indeed that they are incapable of application to any particular.","Time makes fools of us all. Our only comfort is that greater shall come after us."],"E. V. Lucas":["Nothing is so boring as having to keep up a deception.","One of the most adventurous things left us is to go to bed. For no one can lay a hand on our dreams.","There is no diplomacy like candor.","There can be no defence like elaborate courtesy.","There are two words for everything.","Americans are people who prefer the Continent to their own country, but refuse to learn its languages.","I have noticed that the people who are late are often so much jollier than the people who have to wait for them.","The French never allow a distinguished son of France to lack a statue.","The art of life is to show your hand.","You may lose by it now and then, but it will be a loss well gained if you do.","Nothing is wasted."],"E. W.

Think up something appropriate and do it.","Instead of loving your enemies - treat your friends a little better.","The sounder your argument, the more satisfaction you get out of it.","If there were no schools to take the children away from home part of the time, the insane asylums would be filled with mothers.","Living up to ideals is like doing everyday work with your Sunday clothes on.","What people say behind your back is your standing in the community.","No woman ever falls in love with a man unless she has a better opinion of him than he deserves.","When you are in trouble, people who call to sympathize are really looking for the particulars.","There is always a type of man who says he loves his fellow men, and expects to make a living at it.","Men have as exaggerated an idea of their rights as women have of their wrongs.","If a man has money, it is usually a sign, too, that he knows how to take care of it; don't imagine his money is easy to get simply because he has plenty of it.","Many a man is saved from being a thief by finding everything locked up.","None of us can boast about the morality of our ancestors. The record does not show that Adam and Eve were ever married.","Common sense is compelled to make its way without the enthusiasm of anyone.","Don't abuse your friends and expect them to consider it criticism.","It may be a cold, clammy thing to say, but those that treat friendship the same as any other selfishness seem to get the most out of it.","A modest man is usually admired, if people ever hear of him.","The worst feeling in the world is the homesickness that comes over a man occasionally when he is at home.","The modest person is usually admired, if people ever hear of them.","Everyone suffers wrongs for which there is no remedy.","When men are not regretting that life is so short, they are doing something to kill time.","All of the troubles that some people have in life is that which they married into.","When a man has no reason to trust himself, he trusts in luck.","People are always neglecting something they can do in trying to do something they can't do.","Americans detest all lies except lies spoken in public or printed lies.","A theory is no more like a fact than a photograph is like a person.","For every quarrel a man and wife have before others, they have a hundred when alone.","The little trouble in the world that is not due to love is due to friendship.","The average man's judgment is so poor, he runs a risk every time he uses it.","A woman is as old as she looks before breakfast.","If a woman doesn't chase a man a little, she doesn't love him.","Half the time men think they are talking business, they are wasting time.","The underdog often starts the fight, and occasionally the upper dog deserves to win.","A woman who can't forgive should never have more than a nodding acquaintance with a man.","When a man is trying to sell you something, don't imagine that he is polite all the time.","Marriage is a good deal like a circus: there is not as much in it as is represented in the advertising.","The man who can keep a secret may be wise, but he is not half as wise as the man with no secrets to keep.","The feeling of sleepiness when you are not in bed, and can't get there, is the meanest feeling in the world.","If your faith is opposed to experience, to human learning and investigation, it is not worth the breath used in giving it expression.","Every successful person I have heard of has done the best he could with the conditions as he found them, and not waited until next year for better."],"E.

The Government haven't used the powers which they have for the benefit of the country.","We cannot afford idleness, waste or inefficiency.","Mr. Churchill is proud of Britain's stand alone, after France had fallen and before America entered the War.","I shall strive not to be guilty of adding any fuel to the flames of hatred and passion which, if continued to be fed, promise to burn up whatever is left by the war of decent human feeling in Europe.","If there is to be any hope of prosperity for this country it is by reversing that policy which made us simply the kitchen garden for supplying the British with cheap food.","By keeping the annuities, we could build up a national industry every years as big as the Shannon Scheme.","We hope that the plain people - the labourers and small farmers - will take this opportunity of coming together and working out the National programme.","Here, in Cork district, you have in combination all the dangers which war can inflict.","If war comes upon us, it will come as a thief in the night.","Since this war began our sympathy has gone out to all the suffering people who have been dragged into it. Further hundreds of millions have become involved since I spoke at Limerick fortnight ago.","The part which American friendship played in helping us to win the freedom we enjoy in this part of Ireland has been gratefully recognized and acknowledged by our people.","God has been pleased to save us during the years of war that have already passed.

It is one of the reasons many of us opposed that action against Iraq.","Our community is like many around the country that have, as the gentleman from New York referenced, sophisticated planning and zoning regulations. These are elements that are developed as a result of local community pressure to balance interests.","The Corporation for Public Broadcasting distributes an annual appropriation that we provide in accordance with a statutory formula, the vast majority of which goes directly to public radio and television stations.","We can no longer afford the war in Iraq. Our financial costs have already passed a third of a trillion dollars; the lifetime costs for this war, in both human and economic terms, will be borne by Americans for generations to come.","We won the war, but we are losing the occupation and reconstruction of Iraq. It is past time for a new approach, one that relies on accountability, responsibility, and phasing down the scope of our military commitment.","While the United States has largely been missing in action from the diplomatic game, the European Union and Iran have been making progress at developing a formula that would lead to the suspension of Iran's nuclear enrichment program and the start of serious negotiations."],"Earl Browder":["Because capitalist society has expanded the productive forces so enormously, the social conditions under which it arose lag behind and become fetters holding back the further growth of productive forces.","Marxism is an interpretation of history which explains the progress of society as a product of the expansion of the forces of production of the material means of life, that is, the development of economy.","Socialism is nothing more nor less than the social, political and ideological system which breaks the fetters upon economic growth created under capitalism and opens the way to a new period of economic and social expansion on a much larger scale.","The stage of the development of the productive forces determines the political and ideological superstructure of society which are crystallized into a system of social organization.","I have opposed the Communist cold war line ever since, both by public utterance and by private help to trade unionists breaking free from the Communist influence.","But I made no efforts to organize my supporters to hold on to the apparatus. Consequently I was soon expelled and my followers, who did not change coats overnight, quietly left or were expelled from the party.","I knew I could not maintain that leadership in open struggle against Moscow influence. Only two Communist leaders in history ever succeeded in doing this - Tito and Mao Tse-tung.","Marxism conceives of the new system of socialism as the necessary outcome of all previous history made possible and necessary only by that previous history.","The American Communists had thrived as champions of domestic reform.","The social system grows rigid but the productive forces continue to expand, and conflict ensues between the forces of production and the social conditions of production.","This radical transformation of world power relationships reflects primarily in the case of both the USA and the USSR the growth of the productive forces.","What remains constant for me, during the last 15 years, has been the conviction that the cold war was a calamity for the entire world, and that it can be justified by no consideration of theory, nor by any supposed national interest."],"Earl Butz":["Sometimes my quotes may be too colorful.","While he was president, it was popular to be a Nixon hater.","I was a stubborn cuss, and I made some mistakes.","The difference was you worked for Nixon, and with Ford.","Teaching was the most pleasant thing I did.","No, I try not to be a negative thinker.","Nixon was kind of a loner, he had a cold personality.","I understood public relations and always maintained a high profile.","I made lots of talks and challenged lots of people.","I challenged things that needed to be challenged at Purdue.","Ford was warm and friendly.

We do get together in Houston now and then.","I had two things I could do: I could run over you, and I could put a good stiff arm on you. That was about it.","I have a wife and two boys. One is 18 and the other is 14. The 18-year old is getting ready for college next year and he made a decision to run track. He runs a lot like Michael Johnson.","Somebody will always break your records. It is how you live that counts.","Everything in life has a price on it - there ain't a damn thing free in America, and football has got a price on it.","I talk to student-athletes. I try to get them to remember that they're not just athletes, but student-athletes. You need to get an education, keep your hands clean and try to represent the university.","When I was a kid and got in trouble, I'd always say, Mom, I'm in trouble. Well, Mom, I'm in trouble.","I learned from different guys I played with, too. The key was probably three people: The good Lord, the offensive linemen I played with and great fullbacks that could block very well.","After watching films of Jim Brown, I noticed that he never ran out of bounds. He always ran North and South and that's what I turned my style into. I was a North and South runner.","Coming up as a kid, I played middle linebacker and I was very bow-legged, and I wanted to be like the legendary Dick Butkus.","Emmitt Smith is a great running back. One of the things I like about him along with Edgerrin James is that neither one of them 'show out' when they run a touchdown.","First of all, I'm so glad that the city of Houston has a football team again. They have such great fans. I'm really happy for the people of Houston because they deserve a football team.","I always knew that I wanted to do something in business and I prepared myself for that.","I have a company called Earl Campbell Foods. I got into the meat business in 1991.","I think one game we played the Oakland Raiders and Jack Tatum and I had an accident on the one-yard line. The only thing that Jack Tatum didn't do was wrap me up so I backed into the endzone backwards.","I try to get them to remember that they're not just athletes, but student-athletes.","It really started cooking when I moved to Houston. I bought a house and got my own barbeque pit.","My running style was kind of just head-on, because I couldn't dance.","Our company sells about five to six million pounds of sausage a year. We sell it retail and to restaurants. We've got all kinds of products.","Pittsburgh was a great team. Coach Noll, Joe Greene, Jack Lambert, L.C. Greenwood and all those guys did a great job. That's the team that kept us from winning two Super Bowls. It was a great rivalry.","Sometimes I pay for it, With the way I walk now, the things I did to my body wasn't supposed to be done. At 48 years old, it is saying, 'Hey, Earl, remember what you did to me?'.","There are two things panic patients hate to do. They hate to take medication - and they hate to go to doctors.

I just sing songs.","I'm a writer, so whatever gymnastics jump through my head, I write about it.","I'm a person who is always trying to write in a different vein.","I like to write a lot of satire.","If everything gets too serious for me on the album, I get kinda bored.

Be quick, but don't hurry.","Maybe someone will step up, but they don't have anyone right now.","Guys have to look up to somebody. Everybody needs to have their own role and somebody has to be the star.","When people ask me what I miss most about the game, it's being in the locker room and getting to know the guys. Back in those days, we had roommates. We had to talk basketball and that was a great way to understand the game itself and form those lasting relationships.","Jamal Crawford reminds me the most of myself, the way he goes to the basket. But they need leadership.","One of my other nicknames was Thomas Edison, because I invented so many moves.","I think that any time you're able to get a guy like Carmelo Anthony to be on your team, you're going to be a step up.","Basketball for me has always been a matter of rhythm - what you do bouncing the ball, how you bounce the ball, how you run, how you receive the ball to be in rhythm.","The game of basketball is one thing, but the image of the game is another thing.","I have been involved in music since 1972 when I started managing two artists from The Jimi Hendrix Band. My family has been involved in music for years, so it's kind of in my blood. I just wish I could sing!","I started playing baseball and soccer. Those were my sports on the streets and in school when I was growing up. I didn't even start playing basketball until I was 14.","Baltimore was like a small town when I got there - the Colts, the Orioles, guys like Frank Robinson, we all knew and respected each other. Everyone would cross paths at one point at Lenny Moore's Sportsman's Lounge, trading stories and having some fun."],"Earl Nightingale":["Learn to enjoy every minute of your life. Be happy now. Don't wait for something outside of yourself to make you happy in the future. Think how really precious is the time you have to spend, whether it's at work or with your family. Every minute should be enjoyed and savored.","All you need is the plan, the road map, and the courage to press on to your destination.","People with goals succeed because they know where they're going.","Our attitude towards others determines their attitude towards us.","Whatever we plant in our subconscious mind and nourish with repetition and emotion will one day become a reality.","The biggest mistake that you can make is to believe that you are working for somebody else. Job security is gone. The driving force of a career must come from the individual. Remember: Jobs are owned by the company, you own your career!","A great attitude does much more than turn on the lights in our worlds; it seems to magically connect us to all sorts of serendipitous opportunities that were somehow absent before the change.","Don't let the fear of the time it will take to accomplish something stand in the way of your doing it. The time will pass anyway; we might just as well put that passing time to the best possible use.","We can let circumstances rule us, or we can take charge and rule our lives from within.","Always keep that happy attitude. Pretend that you are holding a beautiful fragrant bouquet.","Your problem is to bridge the gap which exists between where you are now and the goal you intend to reach.","Creativity is a natural extension of our enthusiasm.","We are at our very best, and we are happiest, when we are fully engaged in work we enjoy on the journey toward the goal we've established for ourselves. It gives meaning to our time off and comfort to our sleep. It makes everything else in life so wonderful, so worthwhile.","We will receive not what we idly wish for but what we justly earn. Our rewards will always be in exact proportion to our service.","The mind moves in the direction of our currently dominant thoughts.","Success is the progressive realization of a worthy goal or ideal.","Picture yourself in your minds eye as having already achieved this goal. See yourself doing the things you'll be doing when you've reached your goal.","You'll find boredom where there is the absence of a good idea.","We all walk in the dark and each of us must learn to turn on his or her own light.","Our environment, the world in which we live and work, is a mirror of our attitudes and expectations.","Your world is a living expression of how you are using and have used your mind.","We tend to live up to our expectations.","People are where they are because that is exactly where they really want to be - whether they will admit that or not.","Everything begins with an idea.","Excellence always sells.","All you have to do is know where you're going. The answers will come to you of their own accord.","You are, at this moment, standing, right in the middle of your own 'acres of diamonds.'","Wherever there is danger, there lurks opportunity; whenever there is opportunity, there lurks danger. The two are inseparable. They go together.","Whenever we're afraid, it's because we don't know enough. If we understood enough, we would never be afraid.","Get into a line that you will find to be a deep personal interest, something you really enjoy spending twelve to fifteen hours a day working at, and the rest of the time thinking about.","What's going on in the inside shows on the outside.","Any person who contributes to prosperity must prosper in turn.","Ideas are elusive, slippery things. Best to keep a pad of paper and a pencil at your bedside, so you can stab them during the night before they get away.","The big thing is that you know what you want.","Everything that's really worthwhile in life comes to us.","You can measure opportunity with the same yardstick that measures the risk involved. They go together.","Executive ability is deciding quickly and getting somebody else to do the work.","Everything in the world we want to do or get done, we must do with and through people.","The more intensely we feel about an idea or a goal, the more assuredly the idea, buried deep in our subconscious, will direct us along the path to its fulfillment."],"Earl Scruggs":["I don't think you'll ever get enough picking.","She was a great lady. We raised three boys, were together as long as she lived, and now she's passed on.","He used to have a tent show, a little tent show, and I thought I was going to get a job working one year on the tent show, but he closed it down and I never got to go out there, but anyway, he had a sax and played drums.","I don't like to travel as much as I have in the past, but it's good for my soul to get to pick, especially with these good musicians and these guys that play so well.","I enjoy doing new tunes. It gives me a little bit to perk up, to pay a little bit more attention.","I know she would want me to still do what I'm doing, because she kept me going a lot of times when I'd almost lose interest in getting out on the road.","I like drums, really, if they're under control.","I worked with a guy, I can't think of his name, him and his wife, and one of them had a saxophone and the other played drums. It wasn't a regular job but I did a few gigs around home with them.","That was one of the best, exciting things for me to play with them. They were very young and eager to go. I'd been playing with a band that was mostly old folks that had been together so long we couldn't do anything to excite each other.","You know you can get gaudy with something, and they didn't do that. To me, I think it's very tasteful, well done, with the silver and gold and the engraving. I think it's very tasteful."],"Earl Sweatshirt":["At the end of the day, I'm not some evil guy.","I think rap music is rap music. I mean, are there heavy writing aspects of it? Absolutely. In a sense, is it poetry? Yeah. I've heard that so much, growing up in a house with poetry. But I think people like to use that as a shortcut for who's good and who's not. It's like the word 'lyrical' - 'lyrical' is the worst word in the entire world.","It takes me a long time to write, and I trust myself, so I write very sparsely, so when I do, I know it's good, you know what I mean? Rather than writing a whole bunch and having to sort out what's good and what's not.","Everyone's like sheep on social media; like, one person starts making noise, and everyone's like, 'Hey, yeah!' and then you got a whole bunch of people making noise at you.","Sometimes videos make a bad song very tight.","All rappers are princesses like me.","Odd Future's like a network as opposed to like a rap group.","My friends have to remind me that it's OK to own the fact that you're good at something. I think it'll just come with getting older.","Twitter is a real addiction, like the color of it, the process of it.","It just happens to be that people like to associate poetry and rap music. I think that idea is kind of corny.","It would be ridiculous to say I don't want to sell records, but I trust my taste.","Rapping is the only time I'm serious.","People think artists like 50 Cent don't have charisma, but it's just a different kind of charisma, a bully charisma, which is kinda frowned upon.","At first, I was just trying to sound like DOOM and Eminem, and then I dug out my own voice, I guess.","Lil B opened up the floodgates for Odd Future, and now rap has a huge Internet culture.","Whatever I think the song sounds like is what I'll name it. It's a feeling thing; it's not logical at all."],"Earl Warren":["In civilized life, law floats in a sea of ethics.","The police must obey the law while enforcing the law.","To separate children from others of similar age and qualifications solely because of their race generates a feeling of inferiority as to their status in the community that may affect their hearts and minds in a way unlikely ever to be undone.","Ben Franklin may have discovered electricity- but it is the man who invented the meter who made the money.","Prior to any questioning, the person must be warned that he has a right to remain silent, that any statement he does make may be used as evidence against him and that he has a right to the presence of an attorney, either retained or appointed.","The most tragic paradox of our time is to be found in the failure of nation-states to recognize the imperatives of internationalism.","Before this distinguished assembly and the world, the bells today proclaim the joyous tidings of the completion of this quietly soaring tower.","There is no requirement that police stop a person who enters a police station and states that he wishes to confess a crime or a person who calls the police to offer a confession because volunteered statements of any kind are not barred by the 5th Amendment.","We conclude that in the field of public education the doctrine of 'separate but equal' has no place.","Many people consider the things government does for them to be social progress but they regard the things government does for others as socialism.","I feel that the greatest reward for doing is the opportunity to do more.","It is the spirit and not the form of law that keeps justice alive.","To get what you want, STOP doing what isn't working.","I always turn to the sports pages first, which records people's accomplishments. The front page has nothing but man's failures.","In these days, it is doubtful that any child may reasonably be expected to succeed in life if he is denied the opportunity of an education.","Everything I did in my life that was worthwhile, I caught hell for.","Life and liberty can be as much endangered from illegal methods used to convict those thought to be criminals as from the actual criminals themselves.","In mid-life the man wants to see how irresistible he still is to younger women. How they turn their hearts to stone and more or less commit a murder of their marriage I just don't know, but they do.","If it is a mistake of the head and not the heart don't worry about it, that's the way we learn.","The censor's sword pierces deeply into the heart of free expression.","The old Court you and I served so long will not be worthy of its traditions if Nixon can twist, turn and fashion If Nixon gets away with that, then Nixon makes the law as he goes along - not the Congress nor the courts.","You sit up there, and you see the whole gamut of human nature. Even if the case being argued involves only a little fellow and $50, it involves justice. That's what is important.","Separate educational facilities are inherently unequal.","If Nixon is not forced to turn over tapes of his conversations with the ring of men who were conversing on their violations of the law, then liberty will soon be dead in this nation.","Legislatures represent people, not acres or trees.","We may not know the whole story in our lifetime.","All provisions of federal, state or local law requiring or permitting discrimination in public education must yield.","I hate banks.

Momentum is the next day's starting pitcher.","Pitching keeps you in the games. Home runs win the game.","When you play for one run, that's usually all you get. I have nothing against the bunt in its place, but most of the time, that place is in the bottom of a long-forgotten closet.","A manager has to convince his hitters that they have to get on base for the next guy and that no player can do it by himself. Sometimes that isn't easy. In the playoffs, you can get into trouble because everybody wants to be a hero.","Nobody likes to hear it, because it's dull, but the reason you win or lose is darn near always the same - pitching.","No one's gonna give a damn in July if you lost a game in March.","You can't sit on a lead and run a few plays into the line and just kill the clock. You've got to throw the ball over the damn plate and five the other man his chance. That's why baseball is the greatest game of them all.","There ain't no genius here. Strategy in baseball is overrated. People say, 'That Weaver, he plays for the long ball too much.' You bet I do. Hit 'em out. Then I got no worry about somebody lousing up a bunt, I got no worry about the hit and run - and that's really overrated - I got no worry about base-running errors. And I can't screw it up myself.","The key to winning baseball games is pitching, fundamentals, and three run homers.","I used to be a pretty good hit-and-run man when I played in the minors. I handled the bat well and could hit the ball to the right side of the infield. Nevertheless, I know that you often give the opposition an out on the hit-and-run play.","A manager's job is simple. For one hundred sixty-two games you try not to screw up all that smart stuff your organization did last December.","In baseball, you can't kill the clock. You've got to give the other man his chance. That's why this is the greatest game.","The Orioles made me. I didn't make the Orioles.","Don't worry, the fans don't start booing until July.","A manager gets in the Hall of Fame by what his players have done for him.","If an umpire misses a called third strike and the other side ends up scoring because of it, I'm not going to forget it. If there are runners on second and third and two out, and if the umpire has just given the hitter an extra strike and the next pitch goes into the hole and both runs score, I've got to say something to the guy.","I wanted no part of losing. Why play if you can't beat the other guys more often than they beat you?","The job of arguing with the umpire belongs to the manager, because it won't hurt the team if he gets thrown out of the game.","The key step for an infielder is the first one, to the left or right, but before the ball is hit.","There are only three outs an inning, and they should be treasured. Give one away, and you're making everything harder for yourself.","Most of the umpires, it's amazing: 98 percent of them will not hold a grudge. I always felt a couple of them did. I never wanted to argue with an umpire in my life.","People always make a lot about how I don't carry grudges. That's my religious upbringing. I went nine years without missing Sunday school. Lutheran. I can't live with hatred inside of me. That's what I learned. I ain't scared of dying, either.","You win pennants in the off season when you build your teams with trades and free agents.","This ain't a football game, we do this every day.","I really don't like confrontations. One of the reasons I'm retiring is that I'm tired of hurting people's feelings.","A winning player is nothing more than a player on a winning team. A losing player is a guy who played on a losing team that year.","A manager should stay as far away as possible from his players. I don't know if I said ten words to Frank Robinson while he played for me.","Coaches are an integral part of any manager's team, especially if they are good pinochle players.","I think the National League has better biorhythms in July.","I think there should be bad blood between all clubs.","The only thing that matters is what happens on the little hump out in the middle of the field.","I became an optimist when I discovered that I wasn't going to win any more games by being anything else.","I had a successful career: not necessarily a Hall of Fame career, but a successful one.","Your most precious possessions on offense are your twenty-seven outs.","In my mind, the home run is paramount because it means instant runs.","The guy who says, 'I love the challenge of managing,' is one step from being out of a job.","Playing baseball is fun. If I could play, I'd never retire. But managing is work. It's constant decisions of whose feelings you want to hurt all the time.","To keep your job, you fire others or bench them or trade them. You have to do the thinking for 25 guys, and you can't be too close to any of them.","You must remember that anyone under 30 - especially a ballplayer - is an adolescent. I never got close to being an adult until I was 32. Even though I was married and had a son at 20, I was a kid at 32, living at home with my parents. Sure, I was a manager then. That doesn't mean you're grown up.","Until you're the person that other people fall back on, until you're the one that's leaned on, not the person doing the leaning, you're not an adult.","I don't want to spend my whole life watching the sun go down behind the left field bleachers.","I stand by my belief that individual performances are the most important part of baseball.","Don't play for one run unless you know that run will win a ballgame.","The key step for an infielder is the first one... but before the ball is hit.","The only thing I'd ever wanted in my life was to be a major-league ballplayer, but I had to admit to myself that I wasn't good enough. It broke my heart.","A manager wins games in the winter when he picks his team.","The easiest way around the bases is with one swing of the bat.","Bad ballplayers make good managers.","Judging ballplayers and turning in reports, giving my opinion of who will get to the big leagues and who will not... I think my baseball judgment was really good.","If you want to steal a base, steal a base. Don't make the hitter swing at a bad pitch trying to protect the runner.","The worst thing about being on the road is all you want to do when you get home is to stay home, but as soon as you get back, all the wife wants to do is go out because she's been stuck home all the time you've been stuck on the road.","What else does a manager do but push buttons? He doesn't hit, he doesn't run, he doesn't throw, and he doesn't catch the ball. A manager has twenty-five players, or twenty-five buttons, and he selects which one he'll use, or push, that day. The manager who presses the right buttons most often is the one who wins the most games."],"Earl Wilson":["A vacation is what you take when you can no longer take what you've been taking.","Science may never come up with a better office communication system than the coffee break.","You may not be able to read a doctor's handwriting and prescription, but you'll notice his bills are neatly typewritten.","One way to get high blood pressure is to go mountain climbing over molehills.","Ever notice that the whisper of temptation can be heard farther than the loudest call to duty.","Snow and adolescence are the only problems that disappear if you ignore them long enough.","Benjamin Franklin may have discovered electricity, but it was the man who invented the meter who made the money.","Gossip is when you hear something you like about someone you don't.","Poise: the ability to be ill at ease inconspicuously.","Always remember, money isn't everything - but also remember to make a lot of it before talking such fool nonsense.","Success is simply a matter of luck.

Don't make yourself stressed out over nonsensical things like material things.","People in general are used to seeing me as the naughty girl because that's what they've always cast me as.","I've always said to my men friends, If you really care for me, darling, you will give me territory. Give me land, give me land.","Whenever I walk out on a stage, I'm begging for affection.","When the people who are responsible for our country ask you a direct question, I expect them to accept a direct answer, not to be blackballed because you are telling the truth.","I've always been multi-cultural myself. I'm not black and I'm not white and I'm not pink and I'm not green. Eartha Kitt has no color, and that is how barriers are broken.","You don't move just because you want to go from this point to that point - the body has to be using the words as well as you vocally use the words.","My house was bugged. They couldn't find any information on me being a subversive because I happen to love America; I just don't like some of the things the government is doing.","If you're looking for immediate rewards, you're only looking for the money.","Aging has a wonderful beauty and we should have respect for that.","I stayed on my own path and did not follow the herd. I made a way for myself.","I love to tease men with my legs.","Just because you are different does not mean that you have to be rejected.","This is where you see the truth of entertainment, because it is not edited. You see it on stage as it is happening. Even if we fall down or forget our words, it's a part of live entertainment.","Eartha Mae is very shy. She's scared to be seen, scared of rejection and even afraid of affection. Relationships can be rather uncomfortable for her. But, as Eartha Kitt, it's fine. I can accept and reject any time I want to. Do I ever reject? Not really. Although people think I do!","Dr. Einstein was not successful in school, but he found something in the air from his own imagination and his own brain power, and look what he did.","You don't have to hit anybody on the head to be sexy.","I am the original 'Material Girl.'","I have to keep testing myself.","A lot can be said with just a look, or the way the body moves. Each song is a different character. So each song takes on a different movement of the body. And the body has to go with the subject and the attitude that you have toward that subject.","I'm a dirt person. I trust the dirt. I don't trust diamonds and gold.","I was given away. If your mother gives you away, you think everybody who comes into your life is going to give you away.","Having my animals or my children with me exorcises that feeling of not being wanted.","I never take anything for granted. I may slip any minute.","When we want to have our own style of living, it is nobody's business but ours. What we do in private is our private business.","Jewelry, to me, is a pain in the derriere, because you have to be watching it all the time.","I love men and I like to get their attention.","The audience has always been my best director.","Generally the whole entertainment business now is bland.","I have a great need for affection from an audience. I don't know whether this is because I had such a tough life when I was a child.","I don't carry myself as a black person but as a woman that belongs to everybody. After all, it's the general public that made me - not any one particular group. So I don't think of myself as belonging to any particular group and never have.","Let's take care of the necessities first: give people jobs, and find a way to get us out of poverty.","I do think that same gender partners should be able to be married. Why not? If you share a life together than who in the world should have anything to say about it?","The public has become my fairy godmother.","I punish myself more than anybody else does if I am stupid about my actions, and I suffer, really suffer.","I used to teach dance lessons.","We're not thought of in terms of color because we are entertainers. We are there to entertain you not because we are black, white, pink, or green or gay or straight or because we are Catholic or Protestant.","Live theater to me is much more free than the movies or television.","Orson Welles was one of these people who was defying everything the doctors told him he wasn't supposed to be doing. He was really enjoying himself when he was eating what he wanted to eat.","I was a street dancer.","I don't wear my political feelings on my sleeve. However, if I'm asked, I will answer honestly.","I am the last of the Mohicans, the creme de la creme of cabaret.","I wouldn't bother to describe me. I'm Eartha Kitt.","Even as a child, I found a way to survive.","I fight for other people better than I fight for myself.","Maybe subconsciously I feel I was meant to work hard for a living.","I am a mother and I know the feeling of having a baby come out of my gut.","I used to love it when I walked down the street and construction workers would whistle.","I was considered an ugly duckling.","I don't think I ever really got interested in theater.","I was an illegitimate, well, I still am an illegitimate child.","I had almost three acres of land in Beverly Hills. And I had a big atrium of chickens because I love that feeling of being in the country and living from the soil.","I never identified with anybody. I have always been very sensitive about my color, because everybody called me 'yellow gal.' I was caught in between both sides - nobody wanted me. I love that my audience is there, but I always feel as though I have to fend for myself.","I think it's fun to look at people with big diamonds. I see them in my audience all the time, with the fur coat, a woman whose hand is always out front, or the two fingers are on the cheek to show her diamond. I don't have anything against that.","In the '50s, critics used to say I had a 'dangerous' act."],"Eason Jordan":["Withholding information that would get innocent people killed was the right thing to do, not a journalistic sin.","It's a war zone. Terrible things happen."],"Eavan Boland":["Poetry begins where language starts: in the shadows and accidents of one person's life.","When I was young, I struggled with authorship: with everything the word meant and failed to mean. Irish poetry was heavy with custom. Sometimes at night, when I tried to write, a ghost hand seemed to hold mine. Where could my life, my language fit in?","I was Irish; I was a woman. Yet night after night, bent over the table, I wrote in forms explored and sealed by English men hundreds of years before. I saw no contradiction.","I know now that I began writing in a country where the word 'woman' and the word 'poet' were almost magnetically opposed. One word was used to invoke collective nurture, the other to sketch out self-reflective individualism. Both states were necessary - that much the culture conceded - but they were oil and water and could not be mixed.","Our present will become the past of other men and women. We depend on them to remember it with the complexity with which it was suffered. As others, once, depended on us.","I still believe many poets begin in fear and hope: fear that the poetic past will turn out to be a monologue rather than a conversation. And hope that their voice can be heard as that past turns into a future.","I had grown up as an Irish poet in a country where the distance between vision and imagination was not quite as wide as in some other countries.","I didn't know how to weigh ideas about poetry. Nothing in the life I lived as a student - and later as wife and mother at the suburban edge of Dublin - suggested I had the wherewithal to do so. But I did have a unit of measurement. It was the measure of my own life.","I was a foggy, erratic teenager: a fifth child, the last in the queue for conversation or attention.","During my twenties and thirties, my interest in the political poem increased as my apparent access to it declined. I sensed resistances around me. I was married; I lived in a suburb; I had small children.","There is nothing settled about a poet's identity. The becoming doesn't stop because the being has been achieved. They proceed together, attached in ways that are hard to be exact about.","New voices in an old art - and women poets have been that for much more than a century - do not diminish the art through the category. They enrich it. They renew it with common quandaries of craft and innovation. The category simply allows the quandaries to be seen more clearly.","I would come to understand there is no poem separable from its source. I began to see that poems are not just an individual florescence. They are also a vast root system growing down into ideas and understandings. Almost unbidden, they tap into the history and evolution of art and language.","In those years of the Fifties, in London and New York, I lived, without knowing it, in a time when the profoundest changes were happening: when a radical alteration was getting ready to happen in the way a society saw young girls. And, as a consequence, in the way they saw themselves.","I had studied Irish history. I had read speeches from the dock. I had tried to fuse the vivid past of my nation with the lost spaces of my childhood. I had learned the battles, the ballads, the defeats. It never occurred to me that eventually the power and insistence of a national tradition would offer me only a new way of not belonging.","I began to write in an enclosed, self-confident literary culture. The poet's life stood in a burnished light in the Ireland of that time. Poets were still poor, had little sponsored work, and could not depend on a sympathetic reaction to their poetry. But the idea of the poet was honored.","At the age of seventeen, I left school. I went to university, and I wrote my first attempts at poetry in a room in a flat at the edge of the city.","The nineteenth century, especially the second half of it, was a time of restatement in Ireland. After the famine, after the failed rebellions of the Forties and Sixties, the cultural and political desires for self-determination began to shape each other in a series of riffs on independence and identity.","In my thirties I found myself, to use a colloquial fiction, in a suburban house at the foothills of the Dublin mountains. Married and with two little daughters, I led a life which would have been recognizable to any woman who had led it and to many others who had not.","One of the things women poets have been engaged in - among the other things they've been doing - is revising parts of the poetic self. Re-examining notions of the authority within the poem, and of the poem.","As far as I was concerned, it was the absence of women in the poetic tradition which allowed women in the poems to be simplified. The voice of a woman poet would, I was sure, have precluded such distortion. It did not exist.","The twentieth century had produced a literature in Ireland that kept a tense distance from the sources of faith - and for good reason. Irish writing had suffered a terrible censorship in the twentieth century.","I had started writing as a poet in a closed, post-Revival, claustrophobic world, where the shadows of the national upheaval and the intense effort - the intense self-conscious effort - to make a literary movement were still evident. Now we lived a life as writers that was more cosmopolitan, more open, that had more travel and exchange.","It is certainly true that writers take a stance at some variance from organized religion. This has not always been true. But since the romantic movement - and I'm referring now exclusively to poetry - the emphasis has been on the individual imagination defined against, rather than in terms of, any orthodoxy.","There is a recurring temptation for any nation, and for any writer who operates within its field of force, to make an ornament of the past: to turn the losses to victories and to restate humiliations as triumphs.","If a poet does not tell the truth about time, his or her work will not survive it. Past or present, there is a human dimension to time, human voices within it, and human griefs ordained by it."],"Eazy-E":["The kids from the streets don't want preaching or messages. They want what they can identify with. They want to hear about the reality of their situation, not fairy tales. They don't care if it's ugly; they just want reality.","I'll let the people decide what they think is good taste.","If you want to get your point across, you gotta cuss.","If we could, we'd change a lot of things. But the only thing that's going to really change things is money and time. And time might just make it worse, too.","Who gave it that title, gangsta rap? It's reality rap. It's about what's really going on.","Movies don't make people act a fool. People act a fool because they want to act a fool.","Cussing ain't for everybody.","I bet there ain't anybody in South Africa wearing a button saying 'Free Compton' or 'California.' They don't give a damn about us, so why should we give a damn about them?","What we're showing may not be your reality, but it's ours.","Not all cops are bad, but this kind of harassment has been going on for years in the ghetto.","I just feel I've got thousands and thousands of young fans that have to learn about what's real when it comes to AIDS.","We're not making records for the fun of it; we're in it to make money.","I'm not religious, but wrong or right, that's me.","I put Compton on the map.","Why do you think the fans like us - why they prefer our street raps over all that phony stuff out there? Because we're telling the real story of what it's like living in places like Compton. We're giving them reality. We're like reporters. We give them the truth.","Compton is my city.","People where we come from hear so many lies that the truth stands out like a sore thumb.","Eazy-E is going to remain Eazy-E. But I will not portray Compton as a bad city.","I'm not a registered Republican or Democrat. I don't even vote.","The black police in Compton are worse than the white police.","We're not into politics at all. We're just saying what other people are afraid to say.","I have seven children by six different mothers. Maybe success was too good to me.","I don't want to be in somebody else's movie, and then they make all the money. I've gotten offers to do the movies, but I won't sell myself short and be in somebody else's movie, like 'Boyz N the Hood.' I don't think I woulda done that.","I go to correctional facilities and talk to kids there. They have little kids in there who are, like, 12 years old, stealing cars and stuff like that.","What the cops did to Rodney King was wrong, and the officers who beat him should be sent straight to prison."],"Eben Alexander":["Our spirit is not dependent on the brain or body. It is eternal, and no one has one sentence worth of hard evidence that it isn't.","As a neurosurgeon, I did not believe in the phenomenon of near-death experiences.","I grew up in a scientific world, the son of a neurosurgeon.","I understand what happens to the brain when people are near death, and I had always believed there were good scientific explanations for the heavenly out-of-body journeys described by those who narrowly escaped death.","I'm not the first person to have discovered evidence that consciousness exists beyond the body. Brief, wonderful glimpses of this realm are as old as human history.","There is no scientific explanation for the fact that while my body lay in coma, my mind - my conscious, inner self - was alive and well."],"Eberhard Arnold":["Only those who look with the eyes of children can lose themselves in the object of their wonder.","Every child is a thought in the mind of God, and our task is to recognize this thought and help it toward completion."],"Eberhard Weber":["There are always some doubts when you do a new album though. You wonder whether you succeeded or not, especially when you waited as long as I did for this one - seven years. You're never really sure if it will be a nice record or not.","As a result, I had to get my own playground which was my band Colours. This band lasted for about eight years and then the air was out of it and it was time to finish.","At the time, I didn't know that bass would not be enough for me. I'm not a bass player because bass is always a background instrument even to this very day.","I am a classical music lover - not necessarily the contemporary stuff, but the old stuff.","I like to create the music I hear in my interior. As a conductor, you have the ability to squeeze the sounds and interpretation you asked for from 50 to 80 people.","I played cello in my high school orchestra.","I realized pretty soon that I have to do more than just play bass in the background way. So, I developed a kind of playing which only a handful of musicians accepted.","I was afraid the other musicians might want to present themselves too much, though I see in the coverage I've received of the album that the musicians got wonderful reviews for their contributions and abilities. I think the four musicians played freely within my limits.","If there is a good musical reason, I think it might draw more attention and sell, though it is not guaranteed. To make a record without a musical reason, you have to either be a pop star who sells automatically or just be lucky.","In 1972, I got my first electric bass and started playing the kind of instrument I play now. I found that the majority of musicians couldn't bear that. They are not used to listening to the bass because they think the bass is in the background to support them.","It is probably very necessary to present your ego at some point.","It's better to finish at the peak or soon after it, than to wait until the audience notices a decline.","On the other hand, I'm very tolerant as well. I expect that everybody can play what they want. I'm only not tolerant when it comes to myself and what is presented on my album that I have to listen to for the rest of my life.","On the other hand, when I give it closer thought, I realize I'm not enough of a dictator to conduct an orchestra because it requires a pretty awful person. When you read these biographies of famous conductors, they are all awful people who fail in their private relationships.","Orchestra had a little brass ensemble on two tracks as well, but the rest was me. I knew I couldn't continue in this direction, even if people liked it, because I can only duplicate myself.","Orchestras are not used to playing the kind of stuff jazz musicians like to play. It requires a lot of rehearsal and recording time, so it's much easier to do on a synth or sampler. So, we came up with that idea.","The problem is that I don't want to add another record to the world that is not necessary to be published, except to make some business. There has to be a musical reason.","The way to compose for me is to have lots of time.","When I started to pick up the bass, it was purely by random chance.","When I think back now to the recording sessions, there is more improvisation than one hears. It's an ideal combination of arrangements and improvisation. Only a few people are able to listen and say what is composed and what is improvised. It's a unit.","Whenever I release a record, it's my record. It's not a selfish thought. I may work all year 'round for other people. So, finally, when I come out with my own album, it should be me with the creative help of other musicians."],"Ebon Moss-Bachrach":["As an actor, you have to give up all control to the director. He's the boss and has all the power. I'm a control freak, so that's really hard for me. Then when you see a film later, it can be infuriating, really disappointing. I've been very lucky, though, and so many of my early experiences were great.","I can't see how I'd learn to be a better actor from reading reviews.","In college, I took an acting class as a lark. I was surprised by how much it interested me. It seemed like something I could do my whole life and always try to get better at.","With a horror movie, you don't want to anticipate where things are going to go.","As an actor, you have to give up all control to the director. He's the boss, and has all the power. I'm a control freak, so that's really hard for me."],"Eckhard Pfeiffer":["We've seen the power of the PC, and we've seen that it's unstoppable.","Today is either the beginning of the end, or the end of the beginning. Today we are making history.","The goal, as Compaq has stated all along in its history, is to support an open industry standard.","No one has ever been able to stop the process and evolution of technology, not even I.B.M. That is going to continue. Those who grab it and move ahead with it will determine the future in this industry.","We are reinventing ourselves as a company. Compaq is taking ownership of its customer relationships and accountability of our customer's needs.","I think the PC will continue to be around for a long, long time to come. We see a new range of products evolving around the PC, but it's not going away.","I admit that the direct model has done a lot for Dell. That's the only thing the company has ever really accomplished.","I see Intershop as a leader in the E-commerce digital economy and believe the company has truly long-term potential.","Retire? I will never retire.","I turned Compaq from a small company with troubles into a computer powerhouse. We can do the same at Intershop.","I am a very thorough person.","Sometimes it's more difficult to achieve a 10% cost reduction than it is to tell people they have to achieve 50%. Small incremental steps block your view of doing something fundamentally different.","I like the challenge of growing small companies into big global companies."],"Eckhart Tolle":["To know yourself as the Being underneath the thinker, the stillness underneath the mental noise, the love and joy underneath the pain, is freedom, salvation, enlightenment.","Life is an adventure, it's not a package tour.","The power for creating a better future is contained in the present moment: You create a good future by creating a good present.","Discontent, blaming, complaining, self-pity cannot serve as a foundation for a good future, no matter how much effort you make.","In the stillness of your presence, you can feel your own formless and timeless reality as the unmanifested life that animates your physical form. You can then feel the same life deep within every other human and every other creature. You look beyond the veil of form and separation. This is the realization of oneness. This is love.","Don't wait to be successful at some future point. Have a successful relationship with the present moment and be fully present in whatever you are doing. That is success.","It is through gratitude for the present moment that the spiritual dimension of life opens up.","Always say 'yes' to the present moment... Surrender to what is. Say 'yes' to life - and see how life starts suddenly to start working for you rather than against you.","When the dog looks at you, the dog is not thinking what kind of a person you are. The dog is not judging you.","Boredom, anger, sadness, or fear are not 'yours,' not personal. They are conditions of the human mind. They come and go. Nothing that comes and goes is you.","In the egoic state, your sense of self, your identity, is derived from your thinking mind - in other words, what your mind tells you about yourself: the storyline of you, the memories, the expectations, all the thoughts that go through your head continuously and the emotions that reflect those thoughts. All those things make up your sense of self.","There is a fine balance between honoring the past and losing yourself in it. For example, you can acknowledge and learn from mistakes you made, and then move on and refocus on the now. It is called forgiving yourself.","Being at ease with not knowing is crucial for answers to come to you.","Realize deeply that the present moment is all you ever have. Make the Now the primary focus of your life.","Wherever you are, be there totally. If you find your here and now intolerable and it makes you unhappy, you have three options: remove yourself from the situation, change it, or accept it totally. If you want to take responsibility for your life, you must choose one of those three options, and you must choose now. Then accept the consequences.","Acceptance looks like a passive state, but in reality it brings something entirely new into this world. That peace, a subtle energy vibration, is consciousness.","The personal ego already has a strong element of dysfunction, but the collective ego is, frequently, even more dysfunctional, to the point of absolute insanity.","People tend to dwell more on negative things than on good things. So the mind then becomes obsessed with negative things, with judgments, guilt and anxiety produced by thoughts about the future and so on.","I don't believe in an outside agent that creates the world, then walks away. But I feel very strongly there is an intelligence at work in every flower, in every blade of grass, in every cell of my body. And it is that intelligence that, I wouldn't say created the universe. It is creating the universe. It's an ongoing process.","When people get taken over by the ego to such an extent, there is nothing else in their mind except the ego. They can no longer feel or sense their humanity - what they share with other human beings, or even with other life forms on the planet. They are so identified with concepts in their minds that other human beings become concepts as well.","If small things have the power to disturb you, then who you think you are is exactly that: small.","To realize that you are not your thoughts is when you begin to awaken spiritually.","To complain is always nonacceptance of what is. It invariably carries an unconscious negative charge. When you complain, you make yourself into a victim. When you speak out, you are in your power. So change the situation by taking action or by speaking out if necessary or possible; leave the situation or accept it. All else is madness.","Your entire life only happens in this moment. The present moment is life itself. Yet, people live as if the opposite were true and treat the present moment as a stepping stone to the next moment - a means to an end.","Power over others is weakness disguised as strength.","People don't realize that now is all there ever is; there is no past or future except as memory or anticipation in your mind.","The answer is, who you are cannot be defined through thinking or mental labels or definitions, because it's beyond that. It is the very sense of being, or presence, that is there when you become conscious of the present moment. In essence, you and what we call the present moment are, at the deepest level, one.","Because of its phantom nature, and despite elaborate defense mechanisms, the ego is very vulnerable and insecure, and it sees itself as constantly under threat. This, by the way, is the case even if the ego is outwardly very confident.","You are the universe, you aren't in the universe.","Memories are thoughts that arise. They're not realities. Only when you believe that they are real, then they have the power over you. But when you realize it's just another thought arising about the past, then you can have a spacious relationship with that thought. The thought no longer has you in its grip.","Prejudice of any kind implies that you are identified with the thinking mind. It means you don't see the other human being anymore, but only your own concept of that human being. To reduce the aliveness of another human being to a concept is already a form of violence.","Thinking is a wonderful tool if it's applied. Thinking, however, can not become the master. Thinking is a very bad master. If you're dominated by thinking then your life becomes very restricted.","Most humans are never fully present in the now, because unconsciously they believe that the next moment must be more important than this one. But then you miss your whole life, which is never not now.","What a liberation to realize that the 'voice in my head' is not who I am. 'Who am I, then?' The one who sees that.","The mind is a superb instrument if used rightly. Used wrongly, however, it becomes very destructive. To put it more accurately... you usually don't use it at all. It uses you.","People look to time in expectation that it will eventually make them happy, but you cannot find true happiness by looking toward the future.","I'm grateful for always this moment, the now, no matter what form it takes.","If you are not living this moment, you are not really living.","You can always cope with the present moment, but you cannot cope with something that is only a mind projection - you cannot cope with the future.","Fear seems to have many causes. Fear of loss, fear of failure, fear of being hurt, and so on, but ultimately all fear is the ego's fear of death, of annihilation. To the ego, death is always just around the corner. In this mind-identified state, fear of death affects every aspect of your life.","The real truths of life are never entirely new to you or to anybody because there is a level deep down within you where you already know all the things, all those spiritual truths that you read or hear, and then recognize them. I say 'recognize' because you're not... it's not new.","Most people treat the present moment as if it were an obstacle that they need to overcome. Since the present moment is life itself, it is an insane way to live.","When you take your attention into the present moment, a certain alertness arises. You become more conscious of what's around you, but also, strangely, a sense of presence that is both within and without.","To me the ego is the habitual and compulsive thought processes that go through everybody's mind continuously. External things like possessions or memories or failures or successes or achievements. Your personal history.","There is such a thing as old emotional pain living inside you. It is an accumulation of painful life experience that was not fully faced and accepted in the moment it arose. It leaves behind an energy form of emotional pain.","Love is a state of being.","Religion and ritual can be vehicles for entering stillness. It says in Psalm 46:10, 'Be still, and know that I am God.' But they are still just vehicles. The Buddha called his teaching a raft: You don't need to carry it around with you after you've crossed the river.","Some people awaken spiritually without ever coming into contact with any meditation technique or any spiritual teaching. They may awaken simply because they can't stand the suffering anymore.","If danger arises in the present moment, there may be an emotion. There may even be pain. But that's a challenge, not a problem. For a problem to exist, you need time and repetitive mind activity.","Any action is often better than no action, especially if you have been stuck in an unhappy situation for a long time. If it is a mistake, at least you learn something, in which case it's no longer a mistake. If you remain stuck, you learn nothing.","When you get into your car, shut the door and be there for just half a minute. Breathe, feel the energy inside your body, look around at the sky, the trees. The mind might tell you, 'I don't have time.' But that's the mind talking to you. Even the busiest person has time for 30 seconds of space.","Love is a state of Being. Your love is not outside; it is deep within you. You can never lose it, and it cannot leave you. It is not dependent on some other body, some external form.","Is fear preventing you from taking action? Acknowledge the fear, watch it, take your attention into it, be fully present with it. Doing so cuts the link between the fear and your thinking. Don't let the fear rise up into your mind. Use the power of the Now. Fear cannot prevail against it.","For many people who are so lost in their minds, so much involved in their thought processes, the only moments they have when they are not trapped in that is when they are relating to their animal, their pet.","That is the real spiritual awakening, when something emerges from within you that is deeper than who you thought you were. So, the person is still there, but one could almost say that something more powerful shines through the person.","The only thing you ever have is now.","Thoughts are fine when you don't confuse them with who you are, and then thoughts are not a problem. Thinking is a wonderful tool to create things in this world. It only becomes problematic and a source of suffering when you confuse thinking with who you are.","Even the most seemingly unpleasant situations - if you become aligned with it, something good will emerge from that.","When you wash your hands, when you make a cup of coffee, when you're waiting for the elevator - instead of indulging in thinking, these are all opportunities for being there as a still, alert presence.","The more you live in the present moment, the more the fear of death disappears.","We should purify our innate well of contentment - what a wonderful expression - and then external things will be in harmony with us.","So many people have this idea: I want to achieve something great or be somebody great. And they neglect the step that leads to greatness. They don't honor this step at this moment because they have this idea of some future moment where they are going to be great.","The soul is your innermost being. The presence that you are beyond form. The consciousness that you are beyond form, that is the soul. That is who you are in essence.","You are not a problem that needs solving.","Narrow your life down to this moment. Your life situation may be full of problems - most life situations are - but find out if you have a problem at this moment. Do you have a problem now?","Your love is not outside; it is deep within you. You can never lose it, and it cannot leave you. It is not dependent on some other body, some external form.","Thought can be so seductive and hypnotic that it absorbs your attention totally, so you become your thoughts.","Many people identify their sense of self with the problems they have, or think they have.","You can have religion with spirituality. You can also have religion without spirituality.","Dogmas are collective conceptual prisons. And the strange thing is that people love their prison cells because they give them a sense of security and a false sense of 'I know.' Nothing has inflicted more suffering on humanity than its dogmas.","In the West, as well as some other parts of the world, the personal sense of ego tends to predominate, whereas in other areas, there is a more collective sense of ego. This collective ego emphasizes the 'we' rather than the 'I.'","Was Jesus the son of God? Yes. But so are you. You just haven't realized it yet.","Many people in this world are still so identified with every thought that arises in their head. There is not the slightest space of awareness there.","I sometimes ask people, 'Can you be aware of your own presence? Not the thoughts that you're having, not the emotions that you're having, but the very presence of your very being?' You become aware of your own presence by sensing the entire energy field in your body that is alive. And that is the totality of your presence.","Thinking fragments reality - it cuts it up into conceptual bits and pieces.","If there are people you haven't forgiven, you're not going to really awaken. You have to let go.","If the structures of the human mind remain unchanged, we will always end up re-creating the same world, the same evils, the same dysfunction.","If you live only in one culture for the first 20 years of your life, you become conditioned without knowing it.","There's not some idea I'm going to create a work that's going to change everybody's consciousness.","I believe that Jesus realized his oneness with God and he showed, what he attempted to do was show the way to all of us, how to realize our own onenes with God also, so he's a precursor.","The 'soul' is one of the words you can use to talk about your innermost being, the essence of who you are.","Jesus said, 'The Kingdom of Heaven is within you.' I think if he lived nowadays, instead of 'kingdom,' he would have said, 'dimension.' And 'heaven' refers to a sense of vastness or spaciousness.","Often, little situations trigger enormous reactions. Be there, present for it. Your partner will find it easier to see it in you, and you will find it easier to see it in them."],"Ed Asner":["I regard myself as a beautiful musical instrument, and my role is to contribute that instrument to scripts worthy of it.","Raising kids is part joy and part guerrilla warfare.","It's like an athlete. He has a string of hot years, and then he fades into nothingness. The actor doesn't necessarily fade into nothingness. After his hot years, he fades into a different category.","Some of my earliest political feelings were based on the anti-Japanese bubblegum cards I got. There were also Spanish Civil War bubblegum cards. Awful.","I loved getting to Chagrin Falls, being by the falls; what a cute place it is.","I pray that this council, which will probably be too late to save Iraq, will do what it can, which will be immeasurably strong in what it does in trying to save our democracy.","They're sheep. They like Bush enough to credit him with saving the nation after 9/11. Three thousand people get killed, and everybody thinks they're next on the list. The president comes along, and he's got his six-guns strapped on, and people think he's going to save them.","I've never stopped loving cartoons. I loved cartoons as a kid. I can still look at them and enjoy them.","To tell you the truth, I hadn't seen any Pixar until I went to see 'Wall-E,' and I watched it and I was shocked to see how adult it was, with the setting in our lives, both present and future, and how they dealt with it... And then quite relieved to find that the one I was working on, 'Up,' how adult it was.","Never thought acting was something you could make a living at. It wasn't until I was in college, and got a lead in a play, that I began to realize I might just be able to blunder into this profession.","I got some news for you. One, there is no Jesus. Two, there is no God. Three, mind your own business and everything works out.","I don't know who made the Earth. I woke up one morning, and it's here. I make the best of it.","My first job was with an auto plant, Kansas City - they treated you like slaves. From there I went back to Chicago, worked in steel mills, drove a cab, stuff like that.","There's never been a time in history, no matter what the public thinks, when actors have been paid more than they should be.","Never stand still. Only stand still enough to learn, and once you stop learning in that stance, move off. Always keep yourself engaged, in theater, in whatever job you can get. If you can't get an acting job, then go backstage. Or take tickets. But be around actors because that is where you will primarily learn.","I don't believe in God, though I'm not prepared to call myself an atheist either. You know the old phrase: 'There are no atheists in foxholes.' I've never been in a foxhole, and if I ever find myself in a foxhole, I'll let you know if I believe in God or not.","I went into acting as psychotherapy, and it's still a work in progress.","They say making laws is like making sausages. You shouldn't watch. It's the same for acting, especially for the actor who works unconsciously.","Where the work goes, I go. Wherever adulation occurs, that's where you'll find me.","I was a newspaper editor in high school, and I truly thought of journalism as a career. I loved it.","The older I've gotten, the more the need to exert comedy no matter how tragic a character I may be portraying because they are essentials for presenting truth.","You don't work with Cloris Leachman, you experience her.","I can do lovers. I can do Sir Galahad types. I'm not going to limit myself in voice-overs to irascible old men.","I'm not sought after. I never get enough work. It's the history of my career. There just isn't anything to turn down, let me put it that way.","To my knowledge, there is no blacklist. But there is a mindset, even among liberal producers, that says 'He may be difficult, so let's avoid him.'","Always keep yourself engaged, in theater, in whatever job you can get.","If you can't get an acting job, then go backstage. Or take tickets.","I am not a method actor, though I studied for a year with Lee Strasburg.","When I was working my way up, it seemed to me that only Westerns and 'Star Treks' or sci-fi movies could afford to get away with presenting the problems - like prejudice and desegregation, for instance - that we face in our everyday lives.","In a way, 'WALL-E' had some of the same disturbing elements that 'Up' does.","I love acting."],"Ed Balls":["My mobile phone battery runs out all the time because all the messages come straight to me.","For the first time I'm free to be myself.","You could get a cheer by saying: 'Let's withdraw from Afghanistan', but I don't think that's where the public's at. It wouldn't be responsible.","It was a mistake. On the information we had, we shouldn't have prosecuted the war. We shouldn't have changed our argument from international law to regime change in a non-transparent way. It was an error for which we as a country paid a heavy price, and for which many people paid with their lives.","Saddam Hussein was a horrible man, and I am pleased he is no longer running Iraq. But the war was wrong.","I set myself one task, which was to get Labour on to the front foot, back in the game, making the weather on the economy, and that's going to take me a year.","I'm a very loyal person and I allowed myself to be defined as somebody who was doing Gordon's bidding. I should have fought back harder to define myself at an earlier stage.","I think three or four years ago, people would have said my biggest weakness was that sometimes I was awkward on television, with my stammer, but I think they'd say that much less now.","We have come to the edge of the abyss and now it is time for a bold step forward. There is a political view that the tougher you are, the more credible you are.","In 1925, when Britain went back to the gold standard, that was supported by the Conservative Party, the Labour Party, the Bank of England, the civil service, the CBI, the TUC, the Times, the Economist; that consensus was very strong.","The thing about politics is to plan 10 years ahead, and assume every year is your last.","I would love to go on 'MasterChef'. But while I really like cooking, I'm doubtful anyone would ever want to pay for what I'd cooked.","I don't think I've ever sent a text to Gordon Brown because I'm confident that he would absolutely have no idea how to receive it. He barely managed to master WordPerfect 4.1."],"Ed Begley, Jr.":["We run around so much - with the best intentions: I want to save the rain forest. I've gotta clean up the oceans. I've gotta save the dolphins. All worthy efforts, but if you're not centered and you don't have the serenity in your life you need to accomplish that task, you're not going to do a very good job.","The environmental crisis is all a result of rushing.","If you're not buying recycled products, you're not really recycling.","People don't want to give up their SUVs. They don't want to turn the thermostat down in the winter and up in the summer.","I was a typical Valley teen, in smoggy Van Nuys.","I've been in movies with Meryl Streep, Jack Nicholson - but I was on 'The Simpsons,' and finally, in the eyes of my children, I was a star.","I ride my bike for transportation a great deal - occasionally I ride it for fun. But I also have a generator bike that's hooked up to my solar battery pack, so if I ride 15 minutes hard on my bike, that's enough energy to toast toast, or power my computer.","For decades, community colleges have been the backbone of American workforce training. Because they are nimble and closely attuned to local community needs, they are inherently positioned to be influential leaders of the movement for a sustainable economy.","As someone who has grown up living in Southern California, I know all too well about the costs and scarcities of water.","The film 'Tapped' illustrates quite clearly how we've been getting 'soaked' for years by the bottled water industry.","I've lived a slower and less expensive life going off the grid, and I'm happier because of it.","I'm a strong proponent of green tech for anyone who can afford it, having spent the last 40 years working toward achieving a smaller and smaller eco-impact for myself.","Los Angeles is a city known as much for it's sun as for its stars and it's dirty air.","California has always led the way on environmental protection and always reaped the benefits, pioneering everything from catalytic convertors on cars to stationary source reduction.","I can trace my environmentally-friendly lifestyle back to my childhood. My father was a conservative Republican that liked to 'conserve'.","I bought my first electric car in 1970. Its top speed was 15 mph and it had just a 15 mile range - it was essentially a golf cart with a windshield wiper and a horn.","I started composting in 1970 by taking my food scraps out behind where I lived and burying them in a hole next to the railroad tracks - and green things started to grow there!","My father also encouraged my love of nature. He urged me to become a Cub Scout, and later a Boy Scout, and I found I really liked being outdoors.","My favorite form of transportation is walking. I live in a neighborhood where you can walk to restaurants, banks, and shops.","People are overwhelmed looking up at the Mount Everest of environmental challenges that we face. But you put one foot in front of the other and you recognize that not everyone is Sir Edmund Hillary.","I'm not a wealthy person because I was never a star. I was a working actor and a supporting actor.","When I was single, I was down to $100 of power a year.","One of the regular intervals of meditation in my life, believe it or not, is in my car.","It takes less land to grow a pound of broccoli than it does a pound of beef. Less land to grow a pound of grain than a pound of beef. Less water, less energy.","By 1990 I went back to no gasoline; I was just riding around on my bike, taking the bus. I had a tiny little electric car that didn't go very far or very fast. People thought I'd lost my mind. Even my own family thought I'd lost my mind.","For my own health, I thought it was better to eat a plant based diet. I'm going to be 60 soon and I have boundless energy and I feel really good, so I'm all for it."],"Ed Belfour":["When one guy undermines the other, it only causes trouble, and the team isn't successful. It's very important for both of us to accept our role and help the team. One guy can get hot, and if that's Alex, I'll support him and help any way I can.","One minute you're a slug and the next minute you're a hero, so you don't know what to think.","There are a lot more shots coming at the net and guys are just shooting it at the net because they have more time and pucks are going in off legs and feet and shoulders and heads, so you might have to play out a little further on the shot and hope it hits you.","Sometimes you can press a little bit and you're trying to do too much and you're trying too hard. You want to win so bad and you want to help the team so badly that you end up trying too much instead of letting the play come to you.","My whole career I'm used to playing a lot of games.","It's always discouraging when you don't have things go your way. They are frustrated just like the rest of us.","It takes two guys on a team to do very well in the end and be successful.","I've been real fortunate to be on a lot of great teams.","I think everybody has to be better, right from me out. Everybody has to step up their games for us to be successful here. I've been lucky to be on some good teams over the years and that's what it takes, everybody contributing night after night.","I love proving people wrong.","I just have a lot of respect for Terry and his family. He played without a mask, and his life was tragically ended. And it just means a lot to me to be up there with him and the other greats that have played that long.","I have been dealing with back problems since 1995 when I was with the Blackhawks, and I've only missed part of one season because of it. That was last season in Toronto.","I hate to lose. Sometimes, I let my emotions get out of control.","Sometimes I can be misunderstood. I'm really competitive.","I've learned not to be as maniacal as I used to be.","Winning the Stanley Cup in '99 was a dream come true. I'll never forget it.","I'm competitive. I'd love another chance to be part of a Stanley Cup championship team. That'd be awesome."],"Ed Bradley":["Be prepared, work hard, and hope for a little luck. Recognize that the harder you work and the better prepared you are, the more luck you might have.","I had a lot of fun in Cambodia, much more so in Cambodia than Vietnam.","The Paris peace talks kept a roof over my head and food on the table and clothes on my back because if something was said going in or coming out, I had the rent for the month.","I'd watch my father get up at 5 o'clock and go down to the Eastern Market in Detroit to do the shopping for his restaurant, and get that business going and then go out on his vending machine business.","My mother worked in factories, worked as a domestic, worked in a restaurant, always had a second job.","There was no one around me who didn't work hard.","You can work hard to sharpen your talent, to get better at whatever it is that you do, and I think that's what it comes back to.","And I always found that the harder I worked, the better my luck was, because I was prepared for that.","I will not go into a story unprepared. I will do my homework, and that's something I learned at an early age.","I taught sixth grade for three and a half years.","But you know, I always said that no one else on my block was on the radio, and it was fun.","I knew that God put me on this earth to be on the radio.","I did anything that would get me on the air.","And I realized that there was no sports reporter, so I started covering sporting events.","I had no experience with broadcasting basketball games, so I took a tape recorder and went to a playground where there was a summer league, and I stood up in the top of the stands and I called the game.","I would listen to how they told the story, to what elements they used, to how it sounded, and that's who I patterned myself after, the people who were on CBS News.","So I just got on the phone and the engineer just patched me in and I did reports. I'd get a community leader and bring him to the phone, call up the station and do an interview over the phone with the guy.","Then I learned how to do wraparounds and things like that. I had no experience.","The only thing I'd ever done with news was to read copy sitting at the microphone in the studio.","I had never been out covering a story, but boy, was that fun.","I stayed three weeks in Paris, fell in love with the city, and decided that I was born to live in Paris.","I made the decision to come back to New York, quit my job and move to Paris.","I always felt more emotionally attached to Cambodia than I did to Vietnam.","That's when I hit the ground. So in the instant that that round landed and blew me in the air, I had those separate and distinct thoughts. The guy who was standing right next to where I had been standing had a hole in his back I could put my fist into.","My uncle was a hero, Lewis Roundtree. He was not even related to me really, but he was always called my uncle. He was like a father to me. I was closer to him than I was my father.","Professionally, I remember Cronkite as a kid growing up, and more so for me, the importance of Cronkite was not him sitting there at the anchor desk, but him out there doing things.","Probably my mother. She was a very compassionate woman, and always kept me on my feet. And I think part of it is just the way you are, the way you're raised. And she had the responsibility for raising me.","You know, I think I still have a sense that no matter what you do, no matter what you achieve, no matter how much success you have, no matter how much money you have, relationships are important.","The people in your life are important. Meaningful relationships with those people are very important."],"Ed Case":["I believe that the fact and the reality of homosexuality and heterosexuality and of opposite and same-gender unions should be taught in our public schools without a value judgement system also being offered.","My own personal, moral, spiritual, religious, etc. beliefs don't oppose same-gender marriage.","I oppose a constitutional amendment against gay marriage.","I support allowing homosexuals to serve openly in our military and eliminating the 'don't ask, don't tell' policy.","The sentiments in Hawaii about Washington's failure of leadership are no different than the rest of the country.","Hawaiians want change, and if the Democrats don't offer change, Hawaiians are going to vote for the Republican who offers change.","I know I can serve Hawaii and our country well in the U.S. Senate, know we can mount a solid statewide campaign, know we have a good chance of prevailing."],"Ed Catmull":["Look at the computer industry. I've watched a lot of companies come and go, some that were right at the pinnacle of their success.","When I was young, it was television that was taking off, and so you had people worried that people were spending too much time watching television.","I can't look at 'WALL-E' or 'Finding Nemo' or 'Up' and look at in the same way as people outside of the company would look at it. Each one of them had angst.","The need to challenge the status quo is just more obvious when you're failing than when you're succeeding. But it's no less urgent.","We have to evolve, we have to change, and in order to do that, we have to initiate the change.","I apply the term 'creativity' broadly... it's problem solving. We are all faced with problems, and we have to address them and think of something new, and that's where creativity comes in.","At Pixar, we believe strongly that filmmakers should develop ideas they are passionate about. This may sound like a no-brainer, but in fact in Hollywood, the big movie studios have whole departments devoted to acquiring and developing projects that will only later be paired with a director-for-hire.","Encourage people to mingle, meet, and communicate.","A hallmark of a healthy creative culture is that its people feel free to share ideas, opinions, and criticisms. Our decision-making is better when we draw on the collective knowledge and unvarnished opinions of the group.","Candor is the key to collaborating effectively. Lack of candor leads to dysfunctional environments.","It doesn't even matter how successful a movie like 'Up' is: you'll never sell a lot of toy walkers. But that's the way we spread out the risk.","Everything's interconnected. That's the way life is.","What happened in the early days of Disney is that Walt Disney used all of the new technologies as they came out. When matting came out, they adopted it. They adopted sound and color and xerography. Walt did that. And then, when he died, people began to think that this is just about making films, so they stopped bringing in new technologies.","I started off life at Pixar with interesting technical problems. But as time has moved on, I found that the social and management problem was far more complex and interesting.","The problem is some of our riskier films just don't make as much money. But if you only make films that will just be commercially successful, then you can also sink yourself as a studio.","Believe me, sequels are just as hard to make as original films.","We encourage our people to build their ideas from scratch, and we give them the resources - and, crucially, the candid feedback - that are required to transform the first wisps of a story into a truly compelling film.","It is not the manager's job to prevent risks. It is the manager's job to make it safe to take them.","It is only by trying new things that we can hope to create products that are original. Don't just say those words; act like you believe them.","We'll fund a project even if I'm skeptical because I'd rather be proven wrong by somebody on the inside than by somebody on the outside.","I don't think most of our films should be realistic, but you want that as an artistic possibility. Then, the artist can take the realism of the world and push it in ways that we can connect with.","Lucasfilm has always had an openness to technology.","One reason for keeping Disney animation separate from Pixar was that by solving their own problems when they finished a film, Disney could say, 'Nobody bailed us out; we did it.' And it's a very important social thing for them to do that.","I know that with most companies that have a lot of success, it tends to throw you off, and you can become more conservative. One of our questions is, How do we keep from being pulled into conservatism because we're afraid of not being successful again?","For me, one of the great tragedies is the conclusion studios have drawn about traditional animation. I believe that 2D animation could be just as vital as it ever was. I think the problem has been with the stories.","If you see a bad live action film, what are the conclusions you draw? Typically, it is that they made a bunch of mistakes, a bad script, wrong casting. You get into 2D, and you get a few films that are not strong films. And what is the conclusion? That it's 2D? I beg to differ. It's a convenient excuse, but it's just wrong.","Are the Simpsons cool? They are, and that is crude 2D animation.","If you put out 20 films, you hope that a number are successful. It's like human reproduction versus frog reproduction. Frogs produce thousands and hope a few succeed. Humans don't produce many babies but put a lot of energy into them, which is kind of where we are. They still don't always succeed, but you try a lot harder.","Every one of our films, when we start off, they suck... our job is to take it from something that sucks to something that doesn't suck. That's the hard part.","The trick is, in everything we do, there are things we love. And sometimes the things we love get us stuck. And it's only if we let go of some of those things that we free the movie up to become greater.","When it comes to producing breakthroughs, both technological and artistic, Pixar's track record is unique. In the early 1990s, we were known as the leading technological pioneer in the field of computer animation.","Pixar is a community in the true sense of the word. We think that lasting relationships matter, and we share some basic beliefs: Talent is rare.","After Pixar's 2006 merger with the Walt Disney Company, its CEO, Bob Iger, asked me, chief creative officer John Lasseter, and other Pixar senior managers to help him revive Disney Animation Studios. The success of our efforts prompted me to share my thinking on how to build a sustainable creative organization.","A movie contains literally tens of thousands of ideas. They're in the form of every sentence; in the performance of each line; in the design of characters, sets, and backgrounds; in the locations of the camera; in the colors, the lighting, the pacing.","Outsourcing, in and of itself, isn't responsible for the erosion of America's high tech infrastructure. The short-term thinking that led to a lot of bad outsourcing decisions is the root cause. And short-term thinking isn't a problem confined to the executive suite. It's a problem in Washington and in our society as a whole.","We need business leaders who have a respect for technical issues even if they don't have technical backgrounds. In a lot of U.S. industries, including cars and even computers, many managers don't think of technology as a core competency, and this attitude leads them to farm out technical issues.","Technical understanding should be a core competency of any company.","With every one of our films, we try to touch emotions, but we don't try to touch the same emotions each time.","If something works, you shouldn't do it again. We want to do something that is new, original - something where there's a good chance of failure.","I actually feel awkward being at the center of attention.","I love solving the problems of having groups work together and removing barriers. But to actually turn around and be in the center of that is an awkward place to be.","We have a whole industry which is gigantic: games. Games is very successful. It's its own art form, though, and it's not the same as a linear narrative.","Linear narrative is an artfully-directed telling of a story, where the lighting and the sound is all for a very clear purpose. You're not just wandering around in the world.","Virtual reality's been around for 40 years. People have been talking about storytelling in that world for all these years, and there have been experiments around of people trying to do that, and always excited about it.","The Pixar name means more than any other name. It's very important to us to keep that name at a high level.","I did like 'Despicable Me.' I thought it was quite good.","I liked the first 'Kung Fu Panda.'","I worked closely with Steve Jobs for twenty-six years. To this day, for all that has been written about him, I don't believe that any of it comes close to capturing the man I knew.","When I was in high school in the early 1960s, I wanted to be an animator and even took art classes. But by the time I was in college, I realized I couldn't draw well enough.","In the early 1970s, I headed to graduate school at the University of Utah and joined the pioneering program in computer graphics because I realized that's where I could combine my interests in art and computer science.","Sometimes a leap of faith doesn't pan out.","Programmers are very creative people. And animators are problem solvers, just as programmers are.","As I look back on my career, I had a goal, which was to build the first feature computer-animated film.","If you're a director presenting a new idea, and the person who can judge whether or not it goes ahead is in the room, that makes you somewhat defensive.","One term that's used in this industry a lot is this notion of 'feeding the beast.' You've got all of these people whose livelihoods are dependent on it. There are enormous pressures to keep material going into it, and the pressures to feed it are not irrational. They're the basis of your business.","When companies are successful or not successful, they almost immediately jump to the wrong conclusions about how they got there or why they got there.","At heart, we believe that the films that work well are the films that do touch people emotionally.","When I see a film, I'll remember that there was a time when it wasn't working, and there was some pain and angst in order to get it to work.","The skill of a good creative leader is being comfortable with blowing up an idea and knowing it will get better.","Creative ideas aren't like Jenga blocks, where they fall apart and you've got to start from scratch, though it can feel that way.","We need to remember we're always a lot more wrong than we think.","One of Pixar's key mechanisms is the Braintrust, which we rely on to push us toward excellence and to root out mediocrity. It is our primary delivery system for straight talk.","The Braintrust developed organically out of the rare working relationship among the five men who led and edited the production of 'Toy Story' - John Lasseter, Andrew Stanton, Pete Docter, Lee Unkrich, and Joe Ranft.","Communication needs to be between anybody at any time, which means it needs to happen out of the structure and out of order.","I've really thought a lot about why other companies fail or succeed. I had to be a student of failure and find out why things went off the rails. I did that at a fairly deep level, and it's still something I do.","The desire to avoid meltdowns actually is one of the things that screws up live-action films.","In life,you're going to have risk, so you have to say, 'My attitude going forward is how to I fix the problem.' And it's not trying to cling onto the past. When I look around, most problems happen because people are trying to cling onto the past.","My best advice came by examples. A supportive environment at home, school, and grad school. Support at the New York Institute of Technology, then George Lucas, Steve Jobs, and Bob Iger. The examples meant that I should support other people, even when things aren't going well. It will pay off."],"Ed Emberley":["I am an old geezer: a grandpa kind of a guy. I was born October 19, 1931.

And then three days later, I'll just forget about it, and I'll be onto something else."],"Ed Gillespie":["On the other side, I do believe that the rhetoric we are seeing from the Democrats today is unprecedented, is a new low in presidential politics and goes beyond political discourse and amounts to political hate speech.","When you look at where the Democratic field is going relative to foreign policy, they are increasingly moving away from a policy of pre-emptive self-defense that the president has adopted since September 11.","So I think that our foreign policy, the president's strong and principled leadership when it comes to the war against terror and foreign policy is going to be an asset.","I accept people for who they are and love them. That doesn't mean I have to agree or that I have to turn my back on the tenets of my faith and reject the tenets of my faith when it comes to homosexuality.","I don't think we're as divided as many in the elite would have us believe.","If Ralph Nader runs, President Bush is going to be re-elected, and if Ralph Nader doesn't run, President Bush is going to be re-elected. We're going to run on the president's strong and principled leadership and his positive agenda for a second term.","I do not believe the American people are going to confuse hatred for passion.","People like passion in politics.","They do believe that if we do not wage this war against terror in places like Baghdad and Kabul, we are more likely to have it waged in Baltimore and Kansas.","We are seeing at the Republican National Committee a phenomenon that is worth noting this week; maybe today, maybe tomorrow, maybe Wednesday, we will have a million first time donors since the president took office.","And so it was interesting for me to find myself very enamored of a Republican president, but Ronald Reagan was someone I thought captured the spirit of America.","The fact is that we as a party at the Republican National Committee registered 3.4 million new voters in the past two years and brought them into the political process. The president won by 3.5 million votes.","The highest percentage of African Americans own their own homes today than ever in our nation's history.","Well, I think the Republican Party is the more populist party.","I think one of the problems the Democrats have today is that they are an elitist party.","I don't believe we're the party of big business.","I believe we're the party of small business.","We are in favor of greater free markets.","Politics swings like a pendulum.","Our party may have swung too far right at various times.","The Democratic Party is getting very angry, and that came through clearly in this election.","One is that President Clinton, in his first two years of his term, did not govern as he had campaigned.","But I think there was a sense amongst the House Republicans especially that we didn't just want to be opposed to Bill Clinton; that we wanted to tell the country what we were for and to brand ourselves in a more positive manner.","Even as a partisan Republican, I'm not sure a 40-year run is healthy for either party.","Frankly, I thought we would have lost the House by now.","Well, my wife, Cathy Gillespie, worked for Joe Barton, who was running for Congress in 1984.","I don't want to be disrespectful of the president of the United States, but as a political person, one of the things I appreciated about this president, in the past year especially, is he is a fantastic candidate.","George W. Bush is not only a great president; he was a great candidate.","I think Karl Rove saw that in George W. Bush early on and understood the impact that he could have on Texas politics and probably on national politics.","Texas is now a cornerstone of the electoral college for Republicans.","If you're a governor of a big state, people sense your presence a little bit, even your fellow governors.","When you were a volunteer for the Bush-Cheney campaign, you came in the morning; you had a supervisor who gave you a list of calls to make and a time to do it in.","I'm a dedicated Republican and a proud party man.","I'm an American first, and I think that's how most people are."],"Ed Greenwood":["Like great teams in sports and business endeavors, if there's a chemistry among the participants, and they truly enjoy fellowship together, everybody wants to be there, stay involved, and just have fun together.","Over the years, Forgotten Realms and gaming have taken me all over the world and made me all sorts of new friends.","I want to work with my friends because Canadian genre publishing is a really small pool.","It's a trifle hard to surprise yourself with a story you've written.","I am thrilled to get the chance to write comics - and to tell Forgotten Realms tales, to boot!","I like humor: the sort of gentle humor that points out human foibles.","I'm going to try to tell stories and let each tale skate its own way into dark or light territory as the needs of the story steer me.","I will raise a book to Brian Thomsen.","When, who, and what things happen to becomes meaningful, then what happens starts to matter, and play can evoke strong emotions, fierce and ongoing urges to succeed, and a desire to leave a mark, drive meaningful change, or build lasting institutions."],"Ed Harris":["I love this country very much, and I'm proud to live here, but I think our current administration is extreme. These are not merely conservative people, these are extreme right-wing people.","I was born in 1950, so there were tons of Westerns on TV by the time I was 6, 7, 8 years old. In terms of television, 'Maverick' and 'Have Gun - Will Travel.' But filmically, classics like 'High Noon' and 'The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance' - that's one of my favorite films.","You can't betray yourself too often, or you become somebody else.","If I started worrying about how my constituents are going to react to every move I make, I wouldn't be able to do my job here. I'll do what I think is right and explain it later.","Pollock said several times that he couldn't separate himself from his art. Not knowing much about modern art when I began to read about him, I was much more his persona - his struggles as a human being - that was interesting to me.","A lot of films come out before they're finished.","For The Truman Show, I worked for a few weeks, do my gig, then I was done.","I am not one of these guys who works job after job after job.","I chose films made by people I wanted to work with, about subject matter I thought was intriguing.","I feel like my place in this industry is still progressing.","I had some really dear friends who died from AIDS-one in particular. His family wasn't around and he didn't have many friends. I spent a lot of time with him in his later days.","I have a tight family group that's really important to me. I don't want to work all the time.","I like to act with people that know what they're doing.","I listen to National Public Radio, which, to me at least, presents the most rounded view of things.","I made career decisions that came from the part of me who wanted to shun the limelight.","I think most people that are looked upon as doing something daring don't necessarily think of it that way-they do what they have to do.","I was concerned about filling my life up with something important to me. To me, it was just necessary.","I'm not an activist per se, but I have strong feelings about things. People can jump on celebrities for being ill-informed or naive, but I've got a right to say what I believe.","I've always wanted to work with Paul Newman. I had a couple opportunities in the past, and I didn't take advantage of it, so it was really fun to be working with him.","If I'm daring at all, I guess it would be emotionally. I try to keep things interesting for myself and to do things that challenge me.","In the past 10 years, I've looked at life as this Pollock stuff. And now I'm almost in the post Pollock phase.","It's hard to see a film that's been made from a book that you really loved because it's such a different experience.","One of the first things I learned about acting was, the only person you compete against is yourself.","Seeing what happens when you rip yourself open is what your job is all about.","There's always a reaction based on fear. People assume if you're criticizing a decision to go to war, then you're saying something against the soldiers-which is not the case.","When Bush first got elected, the very first time there was talk of going to war with Iraq, the mainstream media gave his position total credibility. I didn't get it then, and I don't get it now.","When I decided to direct, never having done that before, is something I'm very proud of.","You get three hours' sleep and then you start all over again. Relentless. Pre-production was almost harder than filming. I was all over the city every day. It was really exhausting.","You look at a guy like Lance Armstrong, and you have to be inspired. I sat next to Kirk Douglas the other day, and he's inspiring for fighting through his stroke.","You can mostly forget ethnic or religious differences. The competition for a bigger share of the oil proceeds is behind much of the fighting.","I bought the rights to this book, 'The Ploughmen,' by a Montana writer named Kim Zupan, and I've written the screenplay, and I really feel pretty strong about it. It's really hauntingly beautiful. It's got some suspense and great drama, but it's a real character thing.","I haven't directed a film since 'Appaloosa,' and I've been looking for something because I love the directing thing.","I actually have a decent singing voice, and I've never been able to sing onscreen. I'd love to do a musical.","I think most families have a few secrets or some strange aspect to their history. We're all fascinated by family dynamics, but I'd much rather sit in an audience and watch someone else's problems!","If I've been an architect of my own career in any fashion, one thing that I've attempted to do is not get typecast, in order to be able to play all different kind of characters. I think I've done a pretty good job of that over the years.","I enjoy acting, and I appreciate people who have passion about what they're doing and have a vision about the film they're trying to make.","Most of the best writing, the most creative writing, the most interesting, the most out-of-the-box kind of stuff, is being done on cable, you know, and on the computer. I mean, whatever it is, Amazon or Netflix or something. Because they're just willing to take chances, you know, and there's a market for it.","There's, what, 300 films at the Telluride or Toronto or something. How many are those people gonna see? How many of those are actually gonna be in a theater, you know? You know, as an actor, I mean, I learned a long time ago that the fulfillment in this business is the doing of it because you can't rely on anything coming out.","I have some property. We have a few acres, so I like working on it, whether it's cutting stuff down, cleaning stuff up, building steps, or working with concrete, you know, brickwork.","I feel fine about getting older because I'm in good shape. I'm 64 and I feel good.","I feel pretty comfortable with who I am. After a while, if you're not, it's like, what are you hoping for?"],"Ed Helms":["You take a vacation to a place like Thailand and you're ready for the excitement of something new and foreign. But when you're working 14-hour days, all you want is something familiar to ground you. And there's just nothing there.","I feel like I'm worried about my later years in life because I feel like I'm using up so much good karma right now. There's going to be some sort of karmic backlash somewhere down the road.","April is tax month. If you are having trouble filing your taxes, then you should hire an accountant. They'll give you the same advice that they've given hundreds of corporations - taxes are for douche bags.","When you're playing a fictional character reacting to the real world, it's incredibly difficult and confusing and kind of messes with your values a bit.","First there was the New Hampshire primary, and we had nearly a year leading up to it. And now, look! Three primaries in one weekend! How many of these things are they going to have?","My friend and I sang an a cappella rendition of Extreme's 'More Than Words' at one of our football pep rallies in a desperate attempt to look cool. For a while, I wore pink Converse All Stars because I thought it made me seem daring and irreverent.","I had envisioned doing comedy since childhood. For sure.","I try to explain to people that you get the roles that are right when they're right. If you have a nerd character but you're kind of a cool guy, you're probably not going to get the nerd part. The nerd is going to get the nerd part. You know, someone like me.","I'm kind of embarrassed by how quickly I adjusted to L.A. I really love it. It's so pleasant.","It's incredibly fun to play someone that you don't like. It exorcises your own demons in a way. It's cathartic. We all have things that we don't like about ourselves, little things. And I get to amplify those things and put them out there. It's fun and it has a cleansing effect.","This may come as a surprise, given the nature of my job, but I am very guarded and contemplative. I'm not a naturally boisterous person.","I'm a very jaded and cynical person.","Vulnerability is huge. I love to see that in characters. It's something I feel like a lot of my comedic heroes have always done.","I happen to think singing is hilarious, especially when it pops out at the wrong time.","When you're in New York City or Los Angeles, even if you're not dealing with show business, there's still this sense that it's the center of the universe. And I think that's a really dangerous, limiting mindset.","I like being from a city that is not entrenched in show business. When you're in New York City or Los Angeles, even if you're not dealing with show business, there's still this sense that it's the center of the universe."],"Ed Koch":["You punch me, I punch back. I do not believe it's good for one's self-respect to be a punching bag.","Stereotypes lose their power when the world is found to be more complex than the stereotype would suggest. When we learn that individuals do not fit the group stereotype, then it begins to fall apart.","The fireworks begin today. Each diploma is a lighted match. Each one of you is a fuse.","If you agree with me on 9 out of 12 issues, vote for me. If you agree with me on 12 out of 12 issues, see a psychiatrist.","Citizens, thank you for all your birthday wishes. I am 88 years old today and still lucky to live in the greatest city in the world.","The knife of corruption endangered the life of New York City. The scalpel of the law is making us well again.","I think I have a very good reputation amongst the gay population and among the whole country because I stood up on the issue of gay rights. It is not easy to stand up on that issue when you are single and male in New York City. I did it anyway.","In action be primitive; in foresight, a strategist.","It happens that I'm heterosexual, but I don't care about that. I do care about protecting the rights of 10 percent of our population who are homosexual and who don't have the ability to protect their rights.","The person who is bent on killing you will follow you wherever you are.","I was born at the age of twelve on a Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer lot.","God gave me a very good hand to play over my 88 years. I have no regrets.","Deals are my art form. Other people paint beautifully on canvas or write wonderful poetry. I like making deals, preferably big deals. That's how I get my kicks.","I'm just a simple Jewish boy from the Bronx.","In a neighborhood, as in life, a clean bandage is much, much better than a raw or festering wound.","I'm not the type to get ulcers. I give them.","If you don't like the President, it costs you 90 bucks to fly to Washington to picket. If you don't like the governor, it costs you 60 bucks to fly to Albany to picket. If you don't like me - 90 cents.","We're in the hands of the state legislature and God, but at the moment, the state legislature has more to say than God.","If you seek violence, we will seek to put you in jail.","You don't have to love them. You just have to respect their rights.","If they don't want to pay for it, they can stop drinking it.","The best way to lose weight is to close your mouth - something very difficult for a politician. Or watch your food - just watch it, don't eat it.","Water, water, everywhere, Atlantic and Pacific. But New York City's got them beat, Our aqua is terrific!","I know many writers who first dictate passages, then polish what they have dictated. I speak, then I polish - occasionally I do windows.","When all are wrong, everyone is right.","If I traveled to the end of the rainbow as Dame Fortune did intend, Murphy would be there to tell me the pot's at the other end.","The art of creation is older than the art of killing.","The mere process of growing old together will make the slightest acquaintance seem a bosom friend.","Maybe he just looks good compared to the bores he's running against.","Clinton has more important things to worry about. He not only risks being destroyed historically, like Afghanistan's Buddha statues; he also could end up going to jail.","There was always a love-hate relationship with New York in the rest of the country, but I made them feel more love than hate.","I said, to be a New Yorker you have to live here for six months, and if at the end of the six months you find you walk faster, talk faster, think faster, you're a New Yorker.","Tone can be as important as text.","The Republicans are coming - make nice.","Have you ever lived in the suburbs? It's sterile. It's nothing. It's wasting your life.","People get tired of you. So they decided to throw me out. And so help me God, as the numbers were coming in, I said to myself, 'I'm free at last.'","Twelve years ago, if someone attacked me, I wouldn't let them get away with it. I'd take them on. I now perceive my job to include allowing people to vent their rage.","It's a lot more fun being a critic than being the one criticized.","My brain is good, but my body is deteriorating. I probably have another two or three years. Or I can pass tomorrow, but it doesn't make a difference to me.","No, I am not a homosexual. If I were a homosexual, I would hope I would have the courage to say so. What's cruel is that you are forcing me to say I am not a homosexual. This means you are putting homosexuals down. I don't want to do that.","How'm I doing?","There's a nastiness out there that wants to harm me with words. These are my enemies - the ideologues, the populists, the columnists who don't like the fact that I take them on toe-to-toe. What I try to do is tell the truth. It's not the coin of the realm in politics.","I injured myself politically when I took on Jesse Jackson' in the 1988 presidential campaign. I was too strident. I didn't recognize the emotional tie that he had with all black voters.","You want me to tell me the truth or do you want me to stroke you?","I changed the city of New York. I gave people back their morale.","I enjoyed my stay in the Congress. Most people do not. And too many people who have been elected really don't understand the nature of government.","If I were running against Chuck Schumer. I would take every one of his Sunday press releases - and there are 52 for as many years as he's been there - and I would ask, 'How many of the things he said he was proposing became law?' I doubt many.","There's enormous energy required to carry grudges - enormous energy! And I'm getting too old to expend my energy that way, cause I think every person has a limited amount of energy. So I have given up all grudges.","When I came in, the city was on the edge of bankruptcy. I'm proud of what I did. I built the foundation that mayors after me built upon - particularly Bloomberg. But the foundation was essential because if it hadn't occurred, we would have been another Detroit.","I was drafted into the Army when I was 19 and came out at age 22. Most people that I knew didn't think they'd come home alive. I didn't think I would either, so I was happy when I did.","I'm confident President Obama will continue his unambiguous commitment to the Jewish state in his second term.","The very fact that I became mayor in 1977 conveys how you can't figure out what the people will do. Nobody thought I would be elected. When I entered I got four percent of the vote in the first poll, four percent.","I was not afraid of the press or the militants. It was uncomfortable, but I was not afraid. With respect to the press, I knew I knew more than they knew about city matters. With respect to the militants, I understood it. I mean, everybody believed in those days that they were being screwed, you know, that somebody was getting ahead of them.","Whenever I leave Manhattan, I get the bends!","To learn something new every day is still exciting!","I never doubted that I would be a good mayor. I never did.","Jews have always thought that having someone elevated with his head above the grass was not good for the Jews. I never felt that way. I believe that you have to stand up.","I love being the mayor. I want to be the mayor forever.","I'm coming to the end of my life. I do reflect on what I've done for the 85 years that I have been given so far. And I'm proud of what I've done.","I have a social life. But I don't discuss it.","I don't believe that in our society that we should have guns.","I like to think that I'm one of the few people in public life who write their own material. I write every word. And I really enjoy writing - especially my political commentary.","I'm sure that people who elected me, some of them thought I was gay, some of them thought I wasn't gay, and most of them didn't care.","When I was first elected I got 50% of the vote in '77 in the general election. In '81 I got 75%. In '85, I got 78%. No mayor has ever gotten that high a vote. So it was not an issue. Except for people who were very hostile to me. They thought they would injure me.","I probably enjoy campaigning more than most other people in public office because I like people and I enjoy going out there and telling people what I've done.","If you listen to Giuliani, it's like nobody did anything to improve the city except him. I'm not part of the history. Bloomberg's not part of the history. It's like, he did it. He's the only one. That's why he's a little crazy.","I think that every Saturday, we ought to say, 'My father's a Jew, my mother was a Jew, and I'm a Jew,' with great pride."],"Ed Kowalczyk":["As a songwriter and a singer in a successful rock band, I have had the good fortune of being surrounded by incredible musicians, lots of wonderful production on both record and onstage, and plenty of volume!","Open Wings - Broken Strings is an opportunity for you to get to the heart of your favorite artists and their songs in a unique and compelling way. Stripped down, intimate and acoustic, you'll hear the strings on the guitar vibrate and buzz, the vocal chords hum and pulsate as the songs you love come to life like you never knew they could.","I was into all of the Pennsylvania teams at some point in my childhood. I would flip back and forth between the Pirates and the Phillies, and I was always a Steelers fan but not much of an Eagles fan. Then I became kind of a band nerd in school, and I went the music route.","I was buddies with Dennis Rodman back in the day; actually, I am still buddies with him, and so I have gone to a lot of games and always enjoyed it.","I am an Alanis Morissette fan. I think that she has a fantastic voice, and I would love to sing with her someday.","I would have to recommend the chorus of 'Lightning Crashes' for just about everyone that needs a little something, a little comeback.","I have never been able to separate - nor have I wanted to - my personal love and desire for truth, passion, and understanding from my lyrics.","I've always been into asking the big questions; I'm the last guy out the door at closing time cuz I was sittin' around 'til the wee hours with the other ones who were asking the same things.","The message of 'The Distance To Here' is no secret. It is a message of love and an invitation to myself and to those who want to come along to ask the big questions and not feel uncool doing it.","The place we go as a band is a sort of samadhi, intensely emotional and not bound by self-thinking. And lyrically, one of the goals is to suggest that something is going on beyond what you can see.","We've never been satisfied with just making 'me' music. What we're doing is trying to go to a place of some reverence.","We've been slighted in the press for being heartfelt.","Critics are critics: their job is to find things wrong with people.","If I were to sit around and think about all the things that were said about Live, I'd never get anything done.","I have always been cursed or blessed with this inability to hide behind anything and to just say exactly what I am experiencing.","It really has become the singular motivation in my life - to surrender to the art and to the free expression of what I may be experiencing in my life spiritually. It is really hard in the face of people who don't get it, but what do you do?","We really want the whole world to know about Live and to experience us.","Our success just flies in the face of critics or people who would rather that we just failed... because we didn't fit into the style of the times or our lyrics were too upfront or too earnest or whatever.","Life takes turns. There are forks in the road.","We never really write 'love' love songs. There's always something twisted about them. But as far as love songs, women just became way more important to us after we turned 21, as a band in general. Kind of broke up our boyhood solidarity as we started branching out into babes.","When you're 19, girlfriends are girlfriends. Then you start thinking about the rest of your life and stuff. I don't know; something happens with your glands. Your alimony gland.","We've always been a band that questions things.","I think the message of the Live/Counting Crows tour is that, aside from what's going on trendwise, if you dig a little, you can always find something to inspire you.","Practicing love is a difficult thing to do. It's much easier to get angry.","Music is a spiritual event and a means to realize freedom.","Individuals have to find a place to experience a profundity of feeling, and art is a means to that.","Lots of human-rights tragedies deserve concerts, but there's something extra with Tibet. It's a spiritual culture, a country rooted in humility and compassion. And among artists, there's a lot of Buddhists, people who want an alternative to basic Christianity, which doesn't offer much.","What I think shines through for us is that we have a real respect for the music and a real reverence.","I feel proud to be a part of rock n' roll and the whole tradition of rock n' roll.","Ever since we started, we've been trying to give people music that is pop music where you could just get into the melody and get into the performance of the band and be quite satisfied.","With every kid, there has just been a deepening of my humanity, because there's no more of a feet-on-the-ground moment than having a child.","I hit this point - I guess you'd say an end of a chapter - where I felt like I kind of did everything. I wasn't interested in music. It was a really strange feeling, and needless to say, it freaked me out a little bit. I really started to go inward and say, 'Hey, what is this about?'","We don't want Offspring-itis, Green Day-itis: you know, that thing where bands are all over the place at once, getting everything at once - major airplay on radio, major airplay on MTV.","We've never been a band that gets up on stage and says, 'OK, we're going to play our entire new album.' Of course we want to introduce new music, but we also want to play the songs people want to sing along with.","I think that every band, whether they admit it or not, is going out there to succeed. I've always worn that on my sleeve.","We came from a small town where there was no music scene or no other bands, and we decided to put ours together and go for it.","Life is full of inspiration, far more than I'll ever get to write about.","I've never had trouble finding inspiration for new songs, no matter what I'm doing.","I kind of spooked myself about getting older. It's not that bad really.","When we were starting out as a band, I was addicted to college radio.","I grew up in an area that was the typical city that was a racially divided and economically segregated place. And it had a big influence on me.","We've never been your traditional rock-pop band. Lyrically, I've always had more of an interest in spirituality and that kind of thing.","I remember people telling me that at 5 1/2 minutes long, 'Lightning Crashes' would never be a hit song.","I took a page out of the U2 book. They've always had a universal approach. Nobody doubts they're Christian, but there's an open door for everybody in any faith to consume the music at any level.","I think 'cool' is overrated.","To make music that means something, you kind of have to drop the cool. You have to be prepared and willing to be uncool.","All of my favorite artists who inspired me were never afraid to be uncool and never afraid to wear their hearts on their sleeves - no matter how much flak they took for it.","From the very beginning, we were all a hundred and ten percent about the music, from the very early days when we could barely play our instruments, and we were just covering other people's songs when we were in high school.","Those first big concerts we played as 'Throwing Copper' started to really reach people worldwide - I think we played our first big arena show at the George Estate basketball arena down in Atlanta. I remember showing up and standing on stage and just being like, 'I can't believe this is going to be full of people. This is huge.'","It's always so rewarding, gratifying to me, as an artist and a writer, to see how this music gets more important for a lot of people as time goes by. And it's not just nostalgia. It's a feeling of it's really relevant to their lives, even though it's 20 or 25 years old or more.","I've found lyrics in songs that always center me.","One of the lyrics from Bono that always sticks with me is 'Where the Streets Have No Name.' Just the name of the song, that sort of oneness, and there isn't any division in yourself, and your just at peace and fired up at the same time.","I love Peter Gabriel, and I've come so close to working with him a few times. We were on a movie soundtrack together, but we didn't actually write together.","When I was a kid, my aunt coached me a little bit for choir, and what she taught me actually stuck with me. She basically taught me to sing from my diaphragm and not from my throat.","All my favorite artists were pretty serious in the sense that their music was something I could sink my teeth into, from Peter Gabriel to U2 to these artists that made me want to read the lyrics and dig into it.","We take the art seriously. We take communicating it seriously. And maybe we took ourselves a little too seriously in the beginning. Sometimes I watch the videos, and I think, 'Yeah, you could've relaxed a lot in the 'I Alone' video,' you know?","Anarchy would be a world that nobody felt responsible for, that nobody felt any sort of love for. When there's real intelligence happening, when there's real love happening, there's a sense of responsibility: Hey, we've got to take care of this place and each other.","I consider our music a catalyst, something that might spark a thought or a question.","Until you solve problems like fear individually, resolve why individuals feel the need to believe in whatever, there's really no point in organizations, in things that turn the world into a concept rather than an individual fact.","When you accept the way things are, there's really no other way to operate than the way you've been conditioned to. You live in America: you're free to vote, you go vote, and you continue to see the problems of being a nationalistic society. You don't really know what to do because you're conditioned to feel that's just the way things are.","I really don't do concept stuff very well. If I'm sitting thinking about what kind of song I want to write, within a few minutes, I'm kind of bored. It's just a personal thing for me.","Arenas, to me, and especially sheds, are really great venues. You get that sea of humanity, but everybody can still see it and hear it. And that's really important to us.","I've never allowed my specific personal practice or belief to be overtly integrated to the music. Because that's crossing the line into, 'We want you to think this.' And that's not what we're about.","I always thought it odoriferous for people to go about trying to pummel others with their ideas.","If there is a doctrine, a message behind Live, it's just that wordless intensity that doesn't necessarily have to mean anything.","The way you perform really depends on the way you live your life. It's not two separate things.","Music, in its clearest and simplest form, can be a catalyst to thought, but that's about it.","You're living in a fantasy to think that music can actually change something.","Part of being an artist is that you want to express yourself to as many people as possible. But you don't want to exclude anyone.","With 'Mental Jewelry,' we put a lot of pressure on ourselves to get something happening. I think we lost some of the personality in the music. 'Throwing Copper''s mission was to begin to get some of that back.","There's a lot of spirituality and hope in our music that I think people are catching on to. It's not punk, it's not Green Day, not Offspring, not Soundgarden, not Stone Temple Pilots, not all of the other bands that are coming out.","The Web has incredible potential for an artist who keeps in touch with millions of people.","It's something I've always been passionate about - which is the power of rock and roll itself. I'm a walking example of its power, 'cause I was totally altered in the seminal years of Live by bands like U2 and R.E.M., U2 in particular.","I'll never forget the first concert I basically went to. Actually, Sonny and Cher was my first concert, but U2 was my first real concert. I was 17 and saw them at JFK Stadium and had really crappy seats.","I believe that rock and roll can really make a huge impact on people's lives.","You look at a song like 'Lightning Crashes,' and it's just so universal."],"Ed Lee":["At the end of the day, tech workers are not robots: they feel, they think, they have values.","I used to brag that I can hold up any eviction - even if the landlord had legal rights, I could hold it up for a year.","What I learned with tech companies is I gotta give people room to experiment, and also to make what might later on be a mistake. This is the attitude I want to build within San Francisco - give some time to the tech community.","I have made 'start, grow and stay' a big part of my administration."],"Ed Markey":["We must vote for hope, vote for life, vote for a brighter future for all of our loved ones.","Education is not only a ladder of opportunity, but it is also an investment in our future.","Although children are only 24 percent of the population, they're 100 percent of our future and we cannot afford to provide any child with a substandard education.","The war against terrorism is a war against those who engage in torture.","We can no longer tolerate losing one more innocent child or putting one more firefighter at risk in a fire that could have been prevented at the cost of pennies by making a couple simple changes to the construction of a cigarette.","The Brown decision promised that every child, regardless of the color of his or her skin, would have unequivocal access to quality education and an equal opportunity to pursue his/her dreams.","The photographs of Iraqi prisoners being subjected to degrading and humiliating treatment by their captors, and the reports of acts of sexual abuse, physical abuse, and other acts of maltreatment shock the conscience.","The falsification of scientific data or analysis is always a serious matter.","It is common knowledge that smoking is considered one of the nation's leading causes of preventable death, but it's less widely known that cigarettes are also the leading cause of fatal fires.","The Republican Party is bringing out here onto the floor of Congress an all-out assault on the protection of the rights of people who work in the fields of our country, in the factories of our country, in the offices of our country.","However, while we should certainly celebrate the demise of overt official racism, we must also critically examine where we are at this historical moment, recognize the many challenges ahead and reaffirm our commitment to making Brown v. Board a reality.","The segregated schools of today are arguably no more equal than the segregated schools of the past.","Our nation's security, economy, and place on the world stage depends on the success our educational system.","Last year in a historic move, the state of New York passed the very first cigarette fire safety standard.","The Christians had a better chance against the lions than the American consumer has against the OPEC cartel.","In Uzbekistan, hundreds of protesters were recently killed under the corrupt regime of President Karimov in what human rights groups are calling a massacre.","Just this week, Syria broke off all relations with the United States military and the CIA.","Hope is the most important four-letter word in the language.","Well, as you know, General Motors does not make hybrids. Ford only made 4,000 hybrids last year.","You have to wait six months to purchase a fuel efficient automobile made from overseas.","People really feel that, when they go to the gas pump now, that the oil cartel is holding them by the legs and tipping them upside down and shaking money out of their pockets.","The problem is, is that President Bush and the Republican leadership in the Congress have resisted attempts to increase dramatically our fuel economy standards over the last five years.","Scientists at MIT and engineering schools all across America say that they could improve the fuel economy standards for the existing set of vehicles by 10 miles per gallon using existing technology, without compromising safety or comfort at all.","That's the premise of the Saudi Arabians. He's holding the president's hand with one. In the other hand, he's got his hand in the pocket of American consumers.","Detroit is saying that the hydrogen vehicle is the vehicle of the future. But it's 15 years from now.","If we fight our enemy using the same inhumane and morally bankrupt techniques that we are trying to stop, we will simply become what we have beheld.","We know that al Qaeda is seeking radioactive materials and technology to launch a devastating attack, and that hundreds of radioactive sources have been lost or stolen in the U.S. and around the world.","First responders will be on the frontlines if there is a terrorist attack in our communities, and we must provide them with the tools they need to do their difficult jobs."],"Ed McMahon":["Honesty is the most single most important factor having a direct bearing on the final success of an individual, corporation, or product.","It's really kind of hard to be a suburb of nothing. If you don't have a downtown, you really don't have anything. It's hard to build a community around parking lots and subdivisions.","Johnny once described our relationship by saying we were as close as two people could be without being married.","There is no planning. On the night it is really great, it's euphoria and if it is not so great there is always tomorrow night. That was his attitude.","There was a time... when people didn't go out of their house on Tuesday night at eight o'clock because Milton Berle was on.","Like Venice, Italy, New Orleans is a cultural treasure. And everyone who lived in the city should be allowed to come back. But that doesn't mean that they all should live in exactly the same spot that they lived before.","Golf courses sell real estate and that's why they're built.","The majority of people who buy homes in golf course communities don't play golf. Golf is way down at the bottom in terms of total numbers and growth.","All Americans need a sense of place. That's what makes our physical surroundings worth caring about.","You can grow without destroying the things that you love."],"Ed Miliband":["While there's capitalism, there'll be socialism, because there is always a response to injustice.","My beliefs will run through everything I do. My beliefs, my values are my anchor and when people try to drag me, as I know they will, it is to that sense of right and wrong, that sense of who I am and what I believe, to which I will always hold.","Yes, look, social class is definitely an issue in Britain, it is definitely an issue and I think that most people across the country would sympathise with the idea that there are lots of people with talent and ability all across this country who want to make more of themselves and part of the responsibility of government is to make that happen.","I don't believe in God personally but I have great respect for those people who do and different people have different religious views in this country.","We do not have to accept the world as we find it. And we have a responsibility to leave our world a better place and never walk by on the other side of injustice.","And think of how we challenged the idea of a male dominated Parliament with All-Women shortlists and made the cause of gender equality central to our government. We were right to do so.","The new generation of Labour is different. Different attitudes, different ideas, different ways of doing politics.","It's really important to say this. Often the faith schools were founded before the state provided education. I want good education in this country so I'm not going to slag off faith schools. I think that it's important that people of different backgrounds and different faiths go to school together and many faith schools do that.","Well you can be the son of a Marxist and not necessarily be a Marxist in all your views.","Look, there is a sort of old view about class which is a very simplistic view that we have got the working class, the middle class and the upper class, I think it is more complicated than that.","Let the message go out - a new generation has taken charge of Labour which is optimistic about our country, optimistic about our world, optimistic about the power of politics. We are optimistic and together we will change Britain.","Freedom and opportunity are precious gifts and the purpose of our politics is to expand them, for all our people.","I suppose not everyone has a dad who wrote a book saying he didn't believe in the Parliamentary road to socialism.","The most important lesson of New Labour is this: Every time we made progress we did it by challenging the conventional wisdom.","I come from a generation that suffered school lessons in portacabins and crumbling hospitals. I tell you one thing, for the eighteen years they were in power the Tories did nothing to fix the roof when the sun was shining.","Think of how we challenged the impression that we taxed for its own sake and that we were hostile to business. We were right to change.","Let's start to have a grown up debate in this country about who we are and where we want to go and what kind of country we want to build.","We began as restless and radical. Remember the spirit of 1997, but by the end of our time in office we had lost our way.","The great thing is that whether we have faith or not, we are by and large very tolerant of people, whatever their particular view.","I want to move to a world of no nuclear weapons but I want to do that through multilateral disarmament so that we all disarm together.","A company is not accountable just to its owners, but to its workers and its customers."],"Ed O'Brien":["It is fantastic to be found in a foreign country.","We are a weird bunch, we are very disparate.","We're not spokespeople, we're musicians.","We're not aware of fame itself, we're not that kind of band.","I don't read the press, I don't watch endless music TV.","I'm thrilled we've got a new single out, as singles were the way I first got into music as a child.","But for the first time, we haven't made a huge leap forward in sound from our last album. Fans who own Kid A should be able to get their heads around it.","We don't hate the media, it's just that when there's too much of it we get bored, but it happens to every human being. I don't think we even hated the media by the time that movie was made. We were just tired.","Of the 25 songs we've recorded there were 24 that we wanted to have on an album. That wouldn't have worked. So when one of our wise managers suggested the idea of considering two different album, it cleared the way for us.","The thing is, it really did take us too long to get these recordings done. We've had our rough times in the studio in the past, but after four weeks most of the material would have been recorded. This time it seemed like it just goes on and on.","There is always some universal proportion, but along with that there are some places where special things happen. Ireland, for example. I've always felt it's interesting to play there. Maybe they just drink more than anybody else.","Everyone who's serious about what they're doing must be in constant motion forward.","Not in the mornings, I'm always so tired in the morning.","It's really weird to be playing chords again. Haven't played chords for a long time. I realised I haven't played chord changes since OK Computer and stuff like that.","At the end of OK Computer we were playing big, big arenas and it wasn't right. You can do those things occasionally but at the time it didn't feel right.","What is so refreshing playing with Neil Finn and all his friends is these people think exactly the same - regular people doing their thing and separating the music from the business.","For a band like us tracklisting is a massive, massive task.","We are different people - you get a different take on the band whoever you speak to. Somehow, at the end of it, it goes through the filtering process and out comes the Radiohead thing.","So we are not doing the traditional album, tour, album, tour, album, tour anymore. We're going to tour when we want to, regardless of whether we've got a record out.","What had disappointed me at the time of the last tour, was to go on a worldwide tour, we were at some incredible places and we couldn't enjoy it, hadn't the time.","I think that's what helped us: confidence, respect, the desire to work hard.","Bowie is a musician, but he works like a painter. Thom always thought that we should aspire to that.","There was this discussion to know how long the human ear was really receptive to the music. A 74 minute CD is too long. We thought about making two CDs, 35 minutes each... But the songs need to breathe.","But we will play 6, 7 new songs each evening, approximately a third in the concert. I think it's a good balance. It will be very interesting to see the public's reaction. But i think when we'll play the very first new piece, we will be scared."],"Ed O'Neill":["I knew I was a good stage actor but I had no idea about movies. And I wasn't a Paul Newman type of guy. That's why I thought the stage is just right for me.","My goal was never to win awards. Mine was let me get to a place where I don't have to work. I don't have to do anything I don't want to.","All this flying around got on my nerves. But then I gave the script to Cathy to get her opinion. When she started to laugh, it was like 'That's it!'. I went to LA and I got the part.","Back then I said to myself 'screw football.' Actually I just took part in this camp as there was nothing better for me to do. They also didn't draft me because they thought I was too wild and undisciplined.","I think I 'turn off' women. I've a kind of a weird personality. Women may think that I'm a mess.","I took a plane from New York City to Los Angeles for an audition. I met all the people. After that, I was told to have another audition, but I didn't want to go there again.","I was very slender and small. All my friends were on the team, so I had to make it too. I was a very aggressive player. I wanted to be one of the best, but I just ended up as one of the good ones.","I went to Ohio University studying arts and history, and playing football. But I was only interested in girls, my pals and sports. I only did the minimum for school.","I'd loved to wear jeans and t-shirts, but everybody was in the peace movement back then. And that was my ploy. I had to be careful not to say things like 'I like meat.' Actually I just wanted to drink beer and to screw.","In the summer we graduated we flipped out completely, drinking beer, cruising in our cars and beating up each other. It was a crazy summer. That's when I started to be interested in girls.","Security was another reason. You never know what can happen to you when you earn a lot of money.","That's a big deal for kids, when they come into the kitchen and the teacher is drinking coffee with mom. They react differently on the next day when you say: 'Sit down and shut-up!'","When I read the pilot 'for Married with Children', it just reminded me of my Uncle Joe... just a self-deprecating kind of guy. He'd come home from work, and the wife would maybe say 'I ran over the dog this morning in the driveway'. And he would say 'Fine, what's for dinner?","I prefer to underplay scenes rather than, you know, be big and drive them. And sometimes you have to do that, but I like the more natural styles.","I say I'm the best actor in America who's never done a movie.","I got into television, and I'm a television guy, so I've never really had a movie career.","I always found that drama, really good drama, has a lot of comedy in it.","I channel surf like probably most people.","I was in Africa once. I was in Kenya. I got off the plane, and I thought, 'Africa...' Some guy in a dashiki said, 'Mr. Bundy. Oh my God, it's you.'","In terms of comedians, I loved, growing up, Jonathan Winters, Sid Caesar, Jackie Gleason, Phil Silvers, Carol Burnett, all those people."],"Ed Oxenbould":["I love to watch low-budget indie artsy films, but I do also love the big blockbuster things. I would love to do that one day, do a Marvel film. That would be really great.","I listen to a lot of music, and I listen to some rap, and I do like listening to Biggie Smalls.","I never really grasped how big it was when I initially got 'Alexander'; I thought, 'Ooh, this is exciting,' but after I got home, I looked back and thought, 'That was an incredible experience.' I got to work with some massive names in Hollywood, and I learnt so much, and then it really kind of struck me how life-changing it was.","I have a real interest in baking. I'd love to go to culinary school. That's actually my plan: to graduate high school and go to culinary school.","I love reading; I really enjoy it. I read books quite fast, which kind of annoys me, but I like it at the same time because I can read a book in a day.","Baking is my pastime. I just love creating things. But it's not what I want to do for a living. Acting is what I want to do.","I love working in America!","I've had horrible days where you wake up with a zit, and you have to film, and it's terrible.","I have made this one dish, a salted caramel chocolate ganache tart. It's so rich. You can only have a few bites!","I don't watch any horror films. I get scared very easily.","My friends and I often film videos when we get together and hang out, and they're usually just silly situational videos just for our own amusement.","With every social media, there's hate and things like that."],"Ed Parker":["The intelligent man is one who has successfully fulfilled many accomplishments, and is yet willing to learn more.","Traditionalists often study what is taught, not what there is to create.","What we do want to see is reforms that are going to have a permanent effect on the budget deficit."],"Ed Pastor":["I will support legislation that benefits the American worker and prevents the outsourcing of American jobs.","Access to basic quality health care is one of the most important domestic issues facing our nation.","I will work to restore fiscal responsibility to our country's budget and to provide for a more robust economy.","Make health care a right, not a privilege.","Stopping Vieques bombing range good; sooner is better.","Obviously, it gave me a chance to see Barcelona. I won't deny that. But I also had a chance to see something in another country in terms of recycling and reusing nuclear material.","Health care should be affordable for everyone.","I will continue to support legislation that provides American families and Seniors affordable health care.","While prices of goods continue to rise, American worker's wages remain stagnant.","Funding and maintaining programs from Head Start to Pell Grants must be a high priority.","While I do not hesitate to applaud certain aspects of the resolution honoring the sacrifices of our courageous soldiers who are risking their lives in Iraq, I cannot be supportive of capitalizing on these very sacrifices for political gain.","Although I voted against the initial resolution approving the war in Iraq, I have consistently voted to support our troops with much-needed armor and supplies.","As a former high school teacher, I know that investing in education is one of the most important things we can do, not only for our children, but for the benefit of our whole community."],"Ed Rendell":["The Medicaid system currently steers people toward nursing home care. Far more people can be covered in community-based care programs for significantly less.","Well, the infrastructure part of the stimulus has worked. There's absolutely no question about it. We can demonstrate in Pennsylvania and other states around the union how it's produced good, paying jobs both on the construction sites and back in American factories. It has worked.","Is regulation per se bad? Is better regulation bad? I think better regulation is good for the business community, and I think that's something we should get together on.","I am a free spirit. I tell the truth, and I like to mix it up.","One of the things that people don't realize is that that natural beauty, those recreational forests, they have an economic development impact for the state as well.","Tourism is our second biggest industry in terms of the people it employs.","There are a tremendous amount of environmental issues that are on the table.","And the beautiful open spaces, the forests of Pennsylvania, the recreational uses that come from having these green open spaces and forests, they contribute dramatically to the level of our tourism, dramatically.","I think if we're going to have to landfill trash, and I think we basically have to, we might as well get the upside for it and dedicate that upside to improving the environment in so many different ways.","We are the second oldest state in the Union because too many of our young people are leaving Pennsylvania. They are leaving Pennsylvania behind for opportunities elsewhere.","Like working families all across the state, we must find a way to make government live within its means.","For my part, I make this pledge to all of you: The politics of division, of pitting east against west, urban versus rural, region against region, and people against people will have no place in my Administration.","Creating new jobs for Pennsylvanians continues to be my highest priority throughout the Commonwealth.","I think a moratorium probably is legal, and we should probably for a short period of time impose a moratorium so that we don't permit any additional landfill permits for the time being, so we don't exacerbate the problem.","But in the long run we're not going to be able to keep out of state trash away from Pennsylvania.","Number one I think we should impose a fee or a tax on the transportation of trash per mile.","And secondly, I would impose a significant state landfill tipping fee and use that tipping fee to fund the billion dollar bond issue that I want to create to produce the funds for all of the environmental challenges that we just went over.","Growing Greener doesn't produce money for farmland preservation or open space preservation.","If there was a way to discourage trash constitutionally, I would sure as heck take a hard look at it. I don't think there is. So I don't think there's a choice here.","And preserving our open spaces or having them there for recreational purposes is one of the things that contributes to the high level of quality of life that we offer in Pennsylvania, and that also translates into economic benefits.","We will not lose this election for lack of money.","I have said consistently both in my papers and in my speeches - which you heard in the primary campaign - that I will continue to phase out the Capital Stock and Franchise tax.","I'm interested in giving business an opportunity by improving the tax environment to invest and grow with Pennsylvania, to expand and put more money in capital investment and creating jobs.","We've been working our tail off and lead by that example.","If I lose, I lose. I'll do it on my terms.","I think Barack Obama has brought a new level of ethical standards to Washington. Has he changed some basic hard-knuckle politics? No. You need hard-knuckle politics to succeed.","I think politics today is all about false choices: You can have a robust energy economy and a challenged environment, or a great environment and no economy. That's a false choice. You can do both.","Look, natural gas, just like oil, is going to eventually go away. It's not renewable.","Natural gas is great for America in so many ways.","One of the reasons we don't have our deficit under control is because Republicans are wusses and won't tell their base a simple fact that everyone knows. We can't eliminate the deficit without raising some revenue... They're wusses.","George W. Bush always said and did what he believed and he let it rip.","Under the law, the government, whether it's state, local or federal, cannot give the Catholic Church or any religious institution money directly.","Most people are motivated by the economy. And if you've lost your job, lost your mortgage, lost your 401(k), you're angry. And if your brother-in-law has lost one of those you're angry still. And when you're angry you take it out on people who are in office. Which is natural.","I am a fiscal conservative.","I normally don't endorse in Democratic primaries.","I hate negative ads in general.","I think national issues play into gubernatorial races less than, obviously, in Senate and Congressional races. Much less. They tend to be more decided by personality, leadership qualities and by state or local issues. They still have some effect, no question about it, but not as much as Senate and Congressional races.","I've always sort of believed that the future takes care of itself.","I love the concept of community energy.","It used to be that Democrats and Republicans would disagree, but they could be social to each other. There were times during the year that we acted together in the good of the country.","If you have spent any time with Barack Obama, you know he's a funny guy. He's a good guy. He knows sports.","I think the president should be accessible, should answer questions that aren't pre-screened, but I think there should be a little bit of dignity to the presidency.","If I were president, I am not sure that I would offer Ed Rendell the job of chief of staff.","Would I be happy just practicing law? No. Would I be happy just doing TV and speeches? No. I want to do all of these things and be as active as I can... but my main goal is to have some degree of influence on the public discussion.","You know rule one for the vice president is make sure you never upstage the president, right? It's rule one."],"Ed Rollins":["I have been a practitioner of tough politics for many decades. There is little that amazes me and even less that shocks me.","The Republican Party, which John McCain led as our nominee in 2008, is going to become irrelevant if we become the party of intolerance and hate. The party founded by Abraham Lincoln was a party that fought slavery and intolerance at every level.","One of the reasons a strategist never sits in a stadium and gets caught up in the crowds - and never sits watching a debate in person - is because the vast majority of American voters watch these political events on television.","There's no smarter politician out there than Bill Clinton.","I think to a certain extent, Clinton may have expected as the senior president that Obama would've reached out to him and asked for his council; he's done that very little. So, I think the relationship has not been good over the years.","Everybody in this race is against Obama, okay? So saying you're against Obama, against Obamacare, all the rest, it's all fine, well and good, except it doesn't move you forward.","I became a Republican in the summer of 1972. I was involved in running President Nixon's re-election campaign in California and became part of his administration at the start of his second term.","When the Republicans controlled the House from 1994 -2006, Democrats like Nancy Pelosi, Barney Frank, Henry Waxman Charlie Rangel, John Conyers and Rahm Emanuel weren't saying we need to move right to win. They stuck to their philosophy. And they fought against Reagan and they fought against the Bushes. And eventually they did win.","I am not predicting here that Obama will fail like Jimmy Carter. What I am predicting is the Republican Party is not extinct and will after a period of time become a strong opposition party.","What we won't become is a 'Democratic Party lite!' We are a party that wants smaller government and lower taxes. Obama and the Democrats do not. We are a party that wants to encourage small business. We are a party that has a large constituent group that believes in a social agenda and we will not abandon them."],"Ed Royce":["The U.S. should support the Nigerian government to stay in Sierra Leone under the ECOMOG umbrella. The U.S. should also support other countries, including Ghana, in ECOMOG until stability is established.","Several of the energy companies want to do the right thing. It's a matter of leveling the playing field though for them and that's why corrective action here is necessary.","I am chairman of the Africa subcommittee in the House of Representatives.","Nigeria is the most populous country in Africa. If Nigeria succeeds at democratic governance it will be an anchor for all of West Africa. Africa needs a strong Nigeria.","The Nigerians have been very instrumental in preserving stability in Sierra Leone. They have done this at considerable cost in dollars and Nigerian lives. The US should encourage Nigeria to stay in Sierra Leone.","The reality is that al Qaeda has been trying to attack the United States since long before Iraq.","Al Qaeda is on the run, partly because the United States is in Afghanistan, pushing on al Qaeda, and working internationally to cut off the flow of funds to al Qaeda. They are having a difficult time. They failed in this endeavor.","I've always had a keen interest in the world. My father was in Patton's 3rd Army, and he helped liberate Dachau in the 7th Army.","Energy has become a national security issue and as technology continues to improve, there will be more debates like the one on Keystone.","A big part of the problem that we face today is that our children have been taught at schools that every idea is right, that no one should criticize others' positions, no matter how odious.","Let us not forget, the financial crisis had its roots in the decision by Congress to embark on a course of social justice to get everyone that wanted a home into one, regardless of whether or not they could afford it.","The Small Business Lending Fund was cleverly named by its authors last Congress. Since its implementation, however, it would appear a more appropriate name would be the Bailed Out Bank Refinancing Fund.","The ongoing dispute over the relocation of U.S. Marines on Okinawa should be quickly settled. This isn't just an issue for the U.S. and Japan. It has regional implications.","The Unites States used to use law enforcement to aggressively target North Korea illicit activities - counterfeiting U.S. currency, drug-running, counterfeit cigarettes and pharmaceuticals - until diplomacy gutted those efforts. The effort should be reinvigorated.","Up until the end of the Bush Administration, there was indifference to the North Korean suffering under Kim Jong-Il.","History is full of examples of regimes that were oppressing at home and aggressive abroad, and I can't think of too many liberal democracies engaging in counterfeiting, drug running, missile proliferation, and just about any other illegal activity you can think of as North Korea does.","The mantra from the Obama State Department is 'smart power' - the not-so-new idea that all elements of national power should be utilized to influence other countries.","I am fighting vigorously for less spending, less waste and limited government. I strongly believe that the more government grows, the less freedom Americans have."],"Ed Sheeran":["The main thing that you have to remember on this journey is, just be nice to everyone and always smile.","Be original; don't be scared of being bold!","I've always had really messy hair.","It was my love for the guitar that first got me into music and singing. Growing up, I was inspired by The Beatles and Bob Dylan. Damian Rice was a huge influence for me musically.","It was my love for the guitar that first got me into music and singing.","Music is a powerful tool in galvanizing people around an issue. There's no better way to get your point across than to put it in a beautiful song.","As far as songwriting, my inspirations came from love, life and death, and viewing other people's situations.","The more you write tunes, the better they will become. The more you do gigs, the better you will become.","But once you've made a song and you put it out there, you don't own it anymore. The public own it. It's their song. It might be their song that they wake up to, or their song they have a shower to, or their song that they drive home to or their song they cry to, scream to, have babies to, have weddings to - like, it isn't your song anymore.","Harry Potter is awesome.","There were a couple of things I needed to do while I was in New York. One was to have a pizza pie, one was to get a tattoo... and the other was to get a Yankees hat.","Try to find someone with a sense of humor. That's an important thing to have because when you get into an argument, one of the best ways to diffuse it is to be funny. You don't want to hide away from a point, because some points are serious, but you'd rather have a discussion that was a discussion, rather than an argument.","I've had years of teasing about my red hair, but I definitely think it toughened me up. If you're ginger, you end up pretty quick-witted.","Some of my tattoos are a bit silly, but I know where and what time I got them.","I don't think that there's much that sets me apart from other musicians, but I think there are definitely things that set me apart from other kinds of artists. I feel that musicians do it their own way, write their own songs and put on a great live shows.","I want to have a career that evolves as I go on.","In my eyes, there's no one better than Stevie Wonder. He's a top dude.","Country music is some of the best-written music in the world, so yeah, one day, I would keep my mind open to doing a country record.","I've never dated anyone in Hollywood - or anyone famous, for that matter. I don't know that I'm ever gonna write a song that you will know who it's about.","I don't really do that whole 'single life' thing. I'm kind of heads down and get things done.","I'd like to say that I'm a rock star, but I'm not - I'm honestly more of a relationship kind of guy. I'm a guy you could take home to meet your mum rather than a guy your mum wouldn't like.","I think I've been around for a while. But I still have to pay my dues.","If Adele's seen as boring, then I'm happy to be boring as well.","I'm quite arty. I didn't know whether to become an artist or musician but I realised I could paint with music. All my songs have colours.","My love songs are very personal and quite weird. They don't really have the big radio hit choruses because basically they're my therapy, stuff I have to get off my chest.","The public has heard the stereotypical love songs a million times, and they've heard the stereotypical life-or-death songs millions of times. It's good to mix it up a little bit.","'Kiss Me.' That's my 'Twilight' tune, a song you'd have on the 'Twilight' soundtrack.","Everyone still thinks I'm Scottish - that's totally wicked.","You can't call me a Twitter phenomenon or a YouTube one. These things are useful, but so's hard gigging. One year I did 311 shows. I did six in one night alone.","Nashville is wicked. It's like a proper music community, but it's also quintessentially American. You bump into people there with cowboy hats that spit in jars and call you 'boy.' I just love that.","I saw Damien Rice in Dublin when I was 13, and that inspired me to want to pursue being a songwriter... I practised relentlessly and started recording my own EPs. At 16, I moved to London and played any gigs I could, selling CDs from my rucksack to fund recording the next, and it snowballed from there.","If I can put on my album in a car or on my headphones and listen to the whole thing and love it, that's what I'm going to be happy putting out there.","I think I need to accept the fact that I am where I am today because fans have shared my music illegally and legally, but I wouldn't be here today without the Internet, so I can't speak out against it.","I think encouraging young people to twerk might be a bad thing. It's a stripper's move. If I had a daughter of nine, I wouldn't want her twerking.","Instead of writing songs for girls, I tend to write albums, which I guess is a bit weird.","I think the moment you start trying to please a fan base is when you start going downhill. I'm going to always, always write about what I want, even if it doesn't necessarily cater to most of them.","I personally don't think ginger men have a habit of being attractive. We have to make ourselves seem attractive by doing stuff.","I find the whole concept of women screaming at me so odd. It's very flattering, but I don't think I will ever consider myself to be a sex symbol.","Growing up, I was inspired by The Beatles and Bob Dylan. Damian Rice was a huge influence for me musically.","I do like my hair. It took a while to come around to the fact that it was quite a unique value point.","I've done some really weird gigs. The ones where no one turned up - they're probably not the interesting ones to talk about. I played some pretty random ones in L.A. I signed to play all-R&B nights or an all-comedy night where I'd be the only white person there. They were fun.","Whenever you have an ex, and they're like, 'I hope we can still be friends!' and you weren't friends before you started dating, then what do you go back to, really?","I'm a huge hip-hop fan from way back in the day.","I think the music I've created is quite odd, and people are going to start talking about that.","I've never really been a confident person, except from a musical standpoint. I had to push myself early on, but it got easier with each gig.","I think YouTube has destroyed the genre barrier. People can be into Justin Bieber and Eminem at the same time. It's a good thing.","The whole 'studly womaniser' thing, I mean, I quite enjoy the title - it's just not very accurate.","I was on some TV shows with Lady Gaga the other week, and you could see the difference in reaction between her fans and my fans outside. She comes out, and she looks like a star, and the reaction is just tears, crying, people going, 'Oh my God, Oh my God.' My fans are like: 'Alright, Ed.'","I get tweets every single day going, like, 'I'm so glad you weren't on 'The X Factor.'","I'd like to have kids and a wife, and you know, drop them off at school and like, do normal things rather that constantly being on tour. Because I'm young now and I haven't really got a social life. This is all I do. It's the best job in the world, but I'll get to the point where there's more to life than work.","I met Bill Clinton; he's a very nice guy. Yeah, Bill Clinton's cool.","Everyone knows almost everything about me. I make it very clear that I'm cool with people knowing all my personal life through my songs.","The best thing about being on the road in general is just playing every single night in front of people that are genuinely fans of your music.","My parents worked in the art world. They were really supportive of my music in that they allowed me to drop out of school and move out of our home, which not many parents would do.","I don't know if my songs fit in films.","I would love to get a Moonman! I'd put it next to my other awards. I don't have a cabinet right now; they're just kind of all around my flat, one next to the TV, one in the bedroom. So, I'd have to build a cabinet.","I've always been a massive fan of John Mayer. I think he's very talented.","The thing that I took away as an early fan from Bob Dylan was the storytelling aspects. He can tell some wicked stories."],"Ed Skrein":["I'm very passionate about the use of sports in young people's lives to build self-esteem and self-discipline and self-confidence. It's been a big thing for me.","You can be powerful without being loud and aggressive.","However we can spread love and progression, we've got to do it.","I was stabbed when I was 17. It was touch and go, and my lung collapsed, and I was in hospital for five days. It is part of my back story.","I like having my back against the wall and doing things I'm not supposed to be good at.","I like making art.","The only memory I have of playing the saxophone was in a school play. We put on 'Grease,' which is still one of my favorite movies. I played Danny, and I slid out on my knees and played a really out-of-tune 'Blue Moon.'","'Spawn' was my favorite growing up, but I loved 'X-Men' and the 'Hulk' too.","I studied fine arts, and color and composition was always my thing, but I've never been too wild with my fashion.","When I'm dressing down, it's simple: I want a good cut, no logos, and usually quite dark colors. My wardrobe is pretty much black, gray, and navy, with a little bit of white.","To me, everyone is equal.","I'm mad creative for acting.","Some of my favorite auditions have been with female directors.","A lot of time, I've had bosses who were women that were, like, described as battleaxes, and I loved 'em, man. We get on like houses on fire.","I always roll with the way things are, so as soon as one decision happens, you just realign and move on and make another decision.","I think, in any workplace environment, the atmosphere trickles down from the top.","My plan was to stay with 'Game of Thrones' for the long haul. That was always my plan. I would have loved to.","I never really look back. My journey has been unorthodox in many ways. All I do is count my blessings and try to be as present as I can, and I'm thankful for every step of this journey.","I couldn't do what I did in 'Deadpool' without 'Transporter,' categorically.","Real human emotion is always interesting.","When I was playing Ajax, he thinks he's a hero; he thinks he's saving people. He thinks he's helping Wade Wilson by turning him into Deadpool.","I've always been a Marvel fan, always been a 'Deadpool' fan.","When it's finished, I'll get the box set, and I'll have a 'Game of Thrones' month, and that'll be fantastic. That'll be really exciting.","I definitely didn't have any dreams of grandeur or dreams of becoming an action movie star.","I don't think I am an action movie star now; I've just done a couple of action movies! I'm just so respectful of the people that have come before me and the hard work they've put in.","We're always compared to somebody in all walks of life, aren't we?","I am a family man, and my most important role is a father to my son.","Even after premieres or events, some of the stars are like, 'Let's go out' and I just go back to the hotel room. I am the most boring person.","I just want to do something well and be a good person with a happy, healthy family."],"Ed Smith":["One of the prices that we pay for integration was the disintegration of the black community.","Segregation was a burden for many blacks, because the end of the civil war and the amendments added to the constitution elevated expectations beyond reality in some respects.","The Washington black community was able to succeed beyond his wildest dreams. I mean, we had our own newspapers, our own restaurants, our own theaters, our own small shops, our own clubs, our own Masonic lodges.","The black community now in many ways divided itself the way the larger white community divides itself, over class issues. And that race is no longer the bond that it once was. That's one of the prices you pay for progress.","Even during my youth, I can recall very few black people living on any kind of public assistance. People were working, doing some kind of job that was useful to the community.","When you were growing up in the 30s, 20s, of course the 40s, all black people at least in the Washington, D.C., area were required to live among themselves.","So I'm a young boy in the 1940s growing up, seeing Ralph Bunche on a regular basis, seeing Duke Ellington on a regular basis. We know that these people are famous. They're living in the same community as we live in. They go to the same stores and shops.","There's a way in which you can look at clothing as your outer skin. And because you were discriminated against because of your complexion, the way in which you could overcome that was through the way in which you presented yourself with your clothing.","I can think of no one that my grandparents knew, that told me stories and that I experienced myself, had any sense of social inferiority growing up in segregated Washington. None whatsoever.","Before Booker T. Washington, we have small business owners but we do not have a philosopher of black entrepreneurship, and that's what Washington was.","Many of the master chefs in the South, both the upper South as well as the deep South, were blacks and many of those people came here to Washington, D.C., and opened up establishments. Very, very few of them have survived. But they certainly were very prominent.","When you say that you are a race man, it means that you embrace the entire black community regardless of the hue, whether somebody is very light and could pass for possibly white or someone is very dark.","People should have the choice to be able to live where they want to live, go to school where they want to go to school, marry whoever they want to marry regardless of what their complexion is and so forth.","It seems every year, people make the resolution to exercise and lose weight and get in shape.","What is wrong with George Bush? What is his problem?"],"Ed Speleers":["I like going to see live bands. Live bands can be quite heavy, but I think it's very relaxing at the same time because you feel so happy and chilled-out.","I never went to stage school or anything like that. It was always plays, productions at school and things like that. The thing for me with acting was it was the only thing I could fully concentrate on. I loved playing sports. I didn't really love studying.","My job isn't about pursuing fame and then becoming an actor. It's about becoming an actor, and if fame follows suit, that's fine.","Education never really interested me, to be fair. I mean, education does interest me, but academic school study is a different thing. I can't quite grasp that.","I was a mixture of a country boy and a town boy, really. Chichester is a town on the coast of England, and I grew up all along that strip of coast that Chichester branches out into. Sometimes I was living in a house in the country, and sometimes I was living in a town.","There are so many great actors, but I really have a lot of respect for Johnny Depp. I've seen a lot of movies with him in it and, even if it's a film that wasn't as successful as you thought it would be, I've never seen him put in a bad performance. My favorite actors from history have to be Steve McQueen and James Dean.","I've wanted to be an actor for such a long time that I haven't had anything else in my thoughts. I think my family would have quite liked me to be a lawyer.","I think it's really important whilst you're a young actor to try as many new things as possible... to try and do something you haven't necessarily been seen doing before.","I'm a big fan of British cinema; I think we make some unbelievably brilliant films, but they can quite often have a dark feel.","The first drama thing I really got stuck into was 'A Midsummer Night's Dream.' I played Puck. That's when I said, 'I want to be an actor.'","I don't think I'm ugly, but I never thought I was that special."],"Ed Stoppard":["I love going to the Via Giulia, a beautiful old cobbled street, which has a bridge at one end behind the Palazzo Farnese. It has long creepers hanging from it, and is the most evocative, beautiful place to stand and enjoy the city.","It's no secret that I'm my dad's biggest fan.","It was inevitable at some point that I would bump into one of my father's plays. The reality of the situation is that I'm a jobbing actor, and any actor would give their eye-teeth to have one of those roles. It's a no-brainer! I'm pleased the stars have aligned around 'Arcadia.'","I wish people would be a bit more aware of how their actions affect everyone around them.","If I manage to get seven hours' sleep, I'm a pretty good parent.","I retreat to my cave in a very male fashion.","I tend to gravitate toward conflicted characters, and a character who is exploring chaos theory and population control and the difficulties of love and family is pretty rich.","The beauty of Rome is that you can wander into a pizzeria just about anywhere and get a real Italian pizza that's thankfully worlds away from the Super Supreme I used to order at Pizza Hut as a kid.","Vatican City is a bit overrated in my opinion - no offence to the Vatican.","I am always nervous when I'm auditioning for a part I really want.","In the life of any actor or actress, there is inevitably a time when they will be eligible to act in a Tom Stoppard play. He has written a lot, and they are revived often, and there are so many characters of different ages that it was more likely I'd end up in something of his than that I wouldn't.","'Upstairs Downstairs' somehow bestrode the different genres that had come before it to create a new drama entity. I suppose that's one of the reasons why it became so instantly popular.","I am a member of the London Library, and on almost every single job I do, there is some benefit to be had in going there and pulling two or three books off the shelves."],"Ed Sullivan":["If you do a good job for others, you heal yourself at the same time, because a dose of joy is a spiritual cure. It transcends all barriers.","Tell me, Connie, is your mother still dead?"],"Ed Townsend":["Democracy is not about one party dominating.","Teachability and trust always leads to total obedience.","If we are really going to learn from others, we must decide to fully obey.","In order to be discipled by others a person must have a trusting heart, one that listens even when it doesn't fully comprehend or see the end result."],"Ed Victor":["The whole purpose of life is to make yourself happy.","I've always lived a life where people have said, 'Look at him. Who does he think he is?' And who I think I am is someone living life to the brim."],"Ed Walsh":["I threw my best to every hitter I faced, and I found I had the strength to go all the way.","I remember when I wanted every pitch to be a strike.","Ball parks are smaller and baseballs are livelier. They've practically got pitchers wearing straitjackets. Bah! They still allow the knuckleball, and that is three times as hard to control."],"Ed Weeks":["I'm a very anxious, nervy kind of loser in many ways, and I get very stressed and a little tense.","When anybody goes to L.A. from London, there's always this slight sense of, 'What are you doing? Who do you think you are? It's never gonna happen.' It's the classic, good-natured British cynicism.","The first thing I ever saw Bradley Cooper in was 'Wedding Crashers.'","To those many millions of you unfamiliar with my work, I play a caddish British doctor in practice with Mindy Kaling on her excellent sitcom 'The Mindy Project.'","I am basically a citizen of the modern world, as we all are, praise the Lord and damn us all to hell.","Chris Messina is amazing, and he's so serious - he's, like, a proper actor! He's got craft! I love to watch him. But not in a creepy way.","We lived in Germany; my father was in the Army, and they figured I would have more consistency at boarding school. That kind of gives you a thick skin.","My life is just a series of mistakes and regrets of varying degrees.","What else does anyone have except for a collection of slightly painful memories?","I think lots of men are like that. We sort of get dressed by our girlfriends.","I've always been in love with the States. When I was a kid, we would take these long summer holidays in Texas, Nashville, and all over. I fell in love with the people, the food, even the smell. You don't necessarily get that in old Europe.","When you're young, oddly enough, you're more afraid, more conservative about what it is you have.","I never drove in England. I rode bicycles. So driving is terrifying.","When I was a kid, in a very white boarding school in England in the '90s, I had this sort of middle part that kids had - that sort of long, floppy hair. So I was always desperate to have long, floppy hair, and I would try and brush it and spray it, and it would just look like a Brillo pad!","Network TV is such a difficult, competitive landscape.","I get a lot of disbelief that my accent could actually be real, which seems strange.","My mom speaks English - she moved to England in the '70s, so she's fluent in English. We use to speak in Spanish when I was a kid all the time, me and my mom. But when I went to boarding school, I kind of lost it a little bit.","I think the accent is what a lot of people find attractive. If you take the accent away, I'm a very troll-like individual."],"Ed Westwick":["Be a good-looking corpse. Leave a good-looking tattoo.","I can get moody sometimes when I wake up after a nap - I'm like a four-year-old.","I'm all for being in love and whenever I like someone, I end up pretty much completely smitten.","Live fast, die young.","When I find someone who is worth it, I'll be nice and respect that person and put some time in.","I don't come from a famous family and don't have this detachment from everyday people and everyday life. I'm just doing my job and the attention that comes with it is part of the territory.","I think gardens are fantastic, and I'd love to draw and design and stuff like that. I love just planting flowers during the summer. There's something very humble about it, and natural and beautiful.","'Villain' is such a harsh word.","Music is my release.","To be respected as an actor it doesn't help to be seen out in the clubs.","This is my trademark: I rip my T-shirt. I'm into the whole showing-a-bit-of-chest-hair thing.","I've always connected with music. Life's not always what you see; it's what going on in your head. Music is what comes out of your subconscious.","It's always good to be around nice-looking people.","I wouldn't want a manicure. I'm a man's man!","I have two older brothers. I am the baby. We're all very, very close. We're great communicators, so we get along really well.","I'm a big fan of Elvis, man. I got 'Heartbreak Hotel' tattooed on my chest.","I grew up in a middle class English family just outside London. I wasn't surrounded by that speedy city lifestyle, it was a little mellower.","I was just doing bits and pieces of acting in the U.K. I'd been in the film 'Breaking and Entering' - Anthony Minghella gave me my start and I miss him dearly. Then I made the trip out to L.A., during one of their pilot seasons, which was when they were developing 'Gossip Girl,' and I auditioned, and things came together.","I've got a clear line between work and real life.","If people want to really know what's up with me then they can read one of my interviews.","Today there are paparazzi out, I'm doing a day of press, I'm in a hotel, I've just been on Radio 1. But when I'm in my day-to-day life people don't know who I am and I'm left to my own devices.","I can't stand watching myself on TV.","When I need to think of, like, a peaceful scene or something, I think of my back garden in summertime. And whenever I hear the lawnmower next door, I always think it's really peaceful.","I can pretty much live without fast food. I haven't eaten McDonald's in so long, but it's okay.","I bite my nails. I've been chewing on them for years. As long as you don't chew through flesh it's all right.","I've been writing a lot of poetry recently. It helps me think and work things out.","I feel like you just need to keep writing until the writing itself just begins to take shape.","I'm just happy to be doing a job that I love.","I love working in America, I love being part of the industry out here.","I'm an actor; I want to play roles, not a role."],"Ed Whitfield":["Ever since I've been in Congress, various groups on the business side, those entities that are creating jobs out there, have felt that the Clean Air Act is really - that there are all sorts of presumptions in favor of the environmentalists.","I'm not a big fan of a lot of government dollars going into research and development for private enterprises... and you're not going to see the House of Representatives, I'm certain, provide a lot of money for research and development for electric vehicles."],"Ed Wood":["Nobody will ever notice that. Filmmaking is not about the tiny details. It's about the big picture.","This story's gonna grab people. It's about this guy, he's crazy about this girl, but he likes to wear dresses. Should he tell her? Should he not tell her? He's torn, Georgie. This is drama.","Really? Worst film you ever saw. Well, my next one will be better. Hello. Hello.","One is always considered mad, when one discovers something that others cannot grasp.","What do you know? Haven't you heard of suspension of disbelief?","Why if I had half a chance, I could make an entire movie using this stock footage. The story opens on these mysterious explosions. Nobody knows what's causing them, but it's upsetting all the buffalo. So, the military are called in to solve the mystery.","Well, I started thinking about what you were saying about how your movies need to make a profit. Now, what is the one thing, if you put it in a movie, it'll be successful?","Yes, but if you take that crap and put a star in it, then you've got something.","It's not a monster movie. It's a supernatural thriller.","We are going to finish this picture just the way I want it... because you cannot compromise an artist's vision.","We shot ten minutes of the movie, and now we're looking for completion funds.","He's too short, he's too... tall, he's... just not going to work."],"Ed Wynn":["A bachelor is a man who never makes the same mistake once.","I've found a formula for avoiding these exaggerated fears of age; you take care of every day - let the calendar take care of the years.","Every radish I ever pulled up seemed to have a mortgage attached to it."],"Edan Lepucki":["My signature is like a squished spider.","It's funny: when I set out to create the world of 'California,' I didn't give the type of apocalypse much thought... I simply set my two characters, Cal and Frida, in a depleted world and moved through it intuitively.","I wish I wasn't so in love, wasn't so interested, in the Internet. I wish I spent less time online and more time outside and in my head. Writing requires solitude and deep, deep daydreaming, and the Internet just kills that - its lure is toward the external; it asks you to flit from place to place.","If you don't ponder the end of the world on a regular basis, I don't think you're really human.","Amazon has historically been a bully, and I don't shop there. But I love Goodreads. For the record.","I have a darker imagination than most people.","Oh how I wish I could be as obsessive as Carrie from 'Homeland' when I'm writing a book! That would save me a lot of trouble during the revision process.","I am always worried that over-planning and outlining will kill the magic of writing; most of the world I created in 'California' occurred via good old sexy sentence-making.","I love how easy it is to run my business, Writing Workshops Los Angeles, with the help of email and my website. I love that I don't have to use cuneiform, a quill, or a typewriter to write my novels - I love to write on my laptop!","Amazon is such a big player in publishing, but a lot of authors feel this connection to their publishing house and their editors who helped them get their books out there, so their loyalties tend to go that way.","I recognize that I'm probably the luckiest novelist in recent memory, because Sherman Alexie, a writer I greatly admire, raved about my book on 'The Colbert Report,' and then Mr. Colbert himself urged his viewers to buy it - on his show and on Twitter.","I still can't believe that I went on 'The Colbert Report' myself; for the appearance I wore a lot of makeup, my hair was curled like a poodle's, and I could barely breathe in my Spanx undergarments. But, hey - an authoress has to lean in, right?","Before my book, 'California,' came out, I had modest hopes for it. Or, let's put it this way - I had the same hopes that every literary fiction writer in America has: I wanted the novel to be well-received, critically. As for sales? I didn't want it to disappoint, but I didn't expect it to be a best-seller, either.","With 'California,' editors were reading it, and fast, and others were emailing my agent to request it. Ultimately, there were a few editors interested in the book, and it sold at auction about two weeks after the submission process started. I couldn't believe it!","I'm a mother of a three-year-old, but when I started 'California,' my son wasn't even a twinkle in my eye. Because the book took as long as it did, I wrote it before I was pregnant, while I was pregnant, and as a new mother - so I enjoyed a diversity of experiences while creating this world.","I'm always looking for complicated characters in fiction about whom I can feel a dozen feelings at once - in the space of a single paragraph, even."],"Edd Byrnes":["Happiness is an inside job.","It was hard to admit I had a problem when I still had money, property, prestige. How can I have a problem when I'm driving my new Mercedes, and it's paid for, and I have a house at Malibu?","When I was 18, I drove from New York to California to be a movie star. Not an actor, mind you, but a movie star. Have you ever heard of anything so silly?","I went to Yugoslavia to make a movie. People saw me there and asked me to do a movie in Germany. And that led to a movie in Italy. Before I knew it, I was in Europe for most of the next 10 years.","In the days when I was the big hero, the money wasn't much. Nobody made anything on television in those days.","I remember we would get young, aspiring actors to come on '77 Sunset Strip' - I remember George Kennedy was one of those - and they would do a big guest star part, a lead, and they'd be paid maybe $850.","The divorce was the toughest thing in my life. It still hurts.","I don't envy young actors.","Madeleine Albright introduced herself to me. I talked to Henry Kissinger and Barbara Walters. And I asked Peter Jennings to write a note of encouragement to my son, Logan, a news anchor at the ABC affiliate in Palm Springs."],"Edd Roush":["Some batters, and good ones too, scoff at the whole theory of place hitting, calling it a myth. They are wrong, however.","Place hitting is, in a sense, glorified bunting. I only take a half swing at the ball, and the weight of the bat rather than my swing is what drives it."],"Eddi Reader":["I decided to build a studio in my house. We built it in my basement kitchen. I had the drummer up by the fish tank. I was in the toilet singing. The bass player was out by the shelves in the living room, and the guitarist was on the couch by the telly.","I have never had a man give me money. I've always been the provider. I have always been the one who went out and earned, and I've never felt unequal in that way.","A couple of taxi drivers have asked me if we can survive financially as an independent nation. I say, how come we are more stupid than Denmark or Finland or Sweden? They've all got the same amount of people. Are we all going to down tools? Is everybody in Scotland going to stop working?","I've been a massive obsessive about jazz singers all my life.","I've often felt I've been born out of my time, and when I started Fairground Attraction in the 1980s, I wanted to be a 1940s jazz singer.","Miley Cyrus is about making money. Amanda Palmer is about making art.","'Vagabond' is about owning where I come from, understanding the real power music had to transport myself with, whether that's busking in Europe or getting number ones.","I can speak French, understand Gaelic and know my history. That's the training music has given me.","Why should Scotland be stopped from suggesting to the English people that we join a new union under new terms? Let's not try to dominate one another. Let's be a collection, like being in the pub with a kitty. When we vote in Scotland, we vote one way, but the other country votes another way and we always end up with what they vote for.","I'm just an ordinary, walking-down-the-street, mother of two children who sings for her supper.","People are people, and I get a bit annoyed that the music business only focuses in on the big metropolises. I find that people that don't live in big cities are just as likely to enjoy music as people that do live in big cities.","I'm not really clear what the whole deal is with flags. I like my flag, but I wouldn't die for it. There's issues of identity, of course. That's going to always come in. I, for example, don't want to be called a 'North Britisher.' I want to be Scottish."],"Eddie Albert":["I don't really care how I am remembered as long as I bring happiness and joy to people.","And so I missed those best years and I find it difficult for me, in groups, to be comfortable.","You can forgive yourself a great deal.","I don't think I'm proud of anything in acting.","I was not really as good as I should have been.","I always thought I was a singer, but I really am not.","What's the most important thing in the world? It's love, and I look at that as an energy, not a sentiment.","If I wasn't Eddie Albert's son, I'd be someone else's. It gave me a chance to do a lot of traveling, but mostly I'm glad I'm his son because he's such a good man.","I always knew I would act. It was just a matter of time.","Usually in features, I'm the lead. I consider the director the captain, but I consider myself the first mate, and it's up to me to keep in contact with the heart of the crew.","Courage is just fear plus prayers plus understanding."],"Eddie Alvarez":["I think bullying in general is for cowards.","I don't have a nickname. But, hey, they can call me what they want - The Silent Assassin, The Underground King. In Japan, they call me American Knuckle Star. Call me what you want.","I'm a little unconventional; I do things a little differently.","There's a part of martial arts where we need humility and respect.","I'm old school, man. I think, if you want to be the best, then beat the best guys.","There's not a single strike that good preparation can't negate.","It's MMA - anything can happen. You can throw a punch from one knee, a punch from anywhere.","I boxed. I did track and field; I did basketball, football, any sport I was able to sign up for.","The right thing to do is just ask what you can give, and then let things manifest in the time they're supposed to.","Having your worst nightmares kind of come true is truly liberating.","Me? I'm no sob story. I get paid well, and I live comfortably.","My biggest fear as a fighter is to be knocked out in front of millions of people. But after it actually happened, there's this calmness about you that says everything is OK.","I'm proud of both sides, and they are both really well known to be fighting heritages, so I tell everyone all the time - they say, 'What are you'? - I say I'm Irish. I'm Puerto Rican. I guess I was born to fight.","The fighters and the fights are what makes UFC great.","I never prepare according to how I feel for a fight. I always prepare to be a better me.","I never take a round off or a run off or a push-up off; that's just not in me.","I was never the most technical; I was never the best at one aspect at this sport, but what I was always good as was negating people's strengths and putting them in terrible situations where they're uncomfortable.","It's hard when you win the title to not think, 'I'm here. Now what do I do?'","When I joined UFC, I said I want to be involved in fights where millions of fans are watching, biting their fingernails, thinking, 'What the heck is going to go on here?'","Conor McGregor - this guy is so offensive minded and never on the defense that whenever you put him on the defense, he gets so flustered and so upset.","I'm a whole lot more than just Spanish or Irish or whatever, but definitely, it's given me help. It's given me a push, and I'm very proud of my Spanish heritage.","I've got the fighting Irish, and Puerto Ricans are some of the best fighters in the world. I'm proud of who I am, but it doesn't define me as a person.","I don't like going to 155; I do it because everyone else does.","We got four-ounce gloves here. It's not hard to knock someone out.","If you're not successful at a certain weight, it rarely has anything to do with gaining or losing 10 pounds. It's something inside of you that you need to fix in order to win. It rarely has anything to do with cutting 10 pounds.","Although I'm shorter, all of my weight I carry in my back and my butt. That's where most of my weight is.","Fighting in general, but especially when I was younger, was tough to deal with because there are so many external things going on that want to control you that most people have no clue about.","I don't need to be told what I am or what I should do or if I beat this guy it means I'm good or if I lose to that guy it means I'm bad. I'm at peace with myself, and I know what I do every day in my training will speak for itself, and success will be a byproduct.","There's a lot of guys in the UFC who are good at one thing, and they get matched up stylistically well.","I've been fighting the best guys, so I would like a gimme fight.","In this sport, the good thing about the UFC and MMA in general is a lot of it's based on perception.","If I can put the right guy with the right mouthpiece in front of the right opponents, we can build a champion, but he doesn't really have to beat the best guys; we just have to give him the right matchups.","You win a world title, you beat the best guys in the world, and a lot of these fans are kind of misconstrued about who are the best fighters in the world.","I'll beat a bunch of good guys, and then I'll get a ton of fans come up to me and go, 'Do you think you can beat Conor McGregor?' And I'm like, 'Oh my God. You guys are disillusioned.' They think because this man's popular he's good.","The fights for me are always about what you cannot see, the intangibles. It's about what's inside - what really is inside.","I won my first 10 fights by knockout. The money was getting larger at the same time.","Out of nowhere, they made an interim belt and had Lee fight Ferguson. This is very odd for me; what went on there? You know. I don't know what went on there.","I had to fight Donald Cerrone, Anthony Pettis, Gil Melendez, Rafael Dos Anjos. I had to fight these guys in order to prove myself in order to get a title shot.","I know what I can do at 155.","I've knocked a ton of guys out. I know the power I have and the advantages I have against the best in the world.","I rarely think that when a guy loses a fight, it's a weight issue. You can either fight, or you can't.","I don't want to go that route where I'm going into fights dehydrated. I used to fight at 170 pounds. I was 10-0 at 170 with eight knockouts. I'm not going to listen to somebody from the outside tell me what weight I should be fighting at.","Where most kids play stickball and hockey, I'd walk down the streets with two sets of boxing gloves and knock on my friend's door and see if he wanted to box. There were boxing gyms on every corner.","I enjoy fights the most once them nerves go away and you settle into the fight. That's when you can have your fun and be creative and just kind of be yourself.","I'm my own biggest critic, so no matter what was being said in the media or being said by fans, I feel the worst when I disappoint myself.","I want to fight Gilbert Melendez.","The idea is to go out there and win in a dominant fashion. That changes people's minds, the way they're thinking about me, and lets people know I'm here to contend for a title.","It's a fist fight - the idea is to go out there and impose my will.","Fighting, for me, is not a career - it's an opportunity. I'm going to take full advantage of it and do it as long as I can. As long as my body lets me and I'm healthy enough to do it naturally, I'll do it.","With MTV2, every fighter is exposed to millions of people, and they won't have to take a monster pay cut to do so.","I want the best guys the promotion has to offer, put them in front of me, and I'll beat them.","I beat Gilbert Melendez, and he got two shots at the title.","I want to fight only dangerous guys. Whenever I've done that in my career, I've stepped up and risen to the challenge.","These kinds of fights, these big fights that get everyone talking and interested, these are the fights I want.","I want to prove the naysayers wrong. They're everywhere. And to be honest with you, they're all I see, and they're what motivates me.","I have a tremendous support from a lot of the Underground fans. They believe in me, they want to see me do well, and they're behind me. But there are a lot of people out there who don't believe it, and so I want to separate perception and reality. I want to be able to do that.","When I say 'fighter,' I am thinking about how you deal with adversity, how you deal with being in bad situations.","The truth is, a large majority of the market, I'd guess 80 percent, doesn't know anything more than what they are sold.","I think sports is a quest to find out what really is - not what perceptions are.","The business aspect of this sport is a contradiction to what it's really about, and that's knowing something for what it is and not just what it looks like.","I will fight whoever the UFC wants me to fight.","I will do whatever the UFC tells me to do, but there's not a doubt in my mind that I can be champion.","I want an opportunity to fight the best in the world and make millions of dollars doing it.","I think when it comes to re-signing with an organisation, there's no real compromise if you're trying to move on.","I like to be with my back against the wall in dangerous situations.","I really didn't want to enter the UFC in a fight that nobody really cared about or where people thought I was just going to whoop some guy.","The more dangerous the opponent, the better fight I've fought. It always made me move in ways I'd never moved before.","If your worst fear can come true, and everything can still be OK, then there's really not much to fear at all.","I would love, love, love to watch Conor McGregor fight Floyd Mayweather.","Typically, I would say that I'm not defined by one loss and I'm not defined by one win. But I'd be lying if I told you I didn't harp on the loss at Madison Square Garden.","I started this fight career with one objective. When I step inside a ring or an octagon, it is to beat the guy in front of me.","Regardless of the magnitude, the crowd, or the pay-per-view sales, the goal is to beat the guy in front of me.","I'm not here if Bill Hunter never forced my hand in wrestling. It was a pivotal point in my life.","From wrestling, I learned that I was capable of much more than I thought I was.","I think it's important to say that I am genuinely thankful for the time at Bellator.","The most comical thing for me, even when I watch movies, is the guy who's so crazy confident about himself, with the mink jacket - to me, that is so funny. I wish I could be like that. As a fighter, I wish I could do that, so I could make people laugh. But I can't; it's not my style.","I've said it from the very beginning: Fighting the best guys in the world doesn't pay as good as the circus. I want to join the circus. I'm trying to get that circus money.","As far as Nurmagomedov, I just don't get how you become the No. 1 contender without actually fighting guys who are ranked in the top 10. It kind of baffles me."],"Eddie Bernice Johnson":["The health effects of air pollution imperil human lives. This fact is well-documented.","There is not an issue that a woman cannot bring a perspective to.","I try hard to convince them it's important - but there's a history of discomfort with minorities voting in some parts of this country, so most especially the older people have to get accustomed to it.","Our second phase was to develop a school curriculum that teaches tolerance, respect for differences, conflict resolution, anger management, and other attributes of peace.","Generally speaking, historically in this country, the care of a child has been thought of as female business.","Well, I happen to believe all business is female business.","All issues are women's issues - and there are several that are just women's business.","Dallas was a Black and White society at that time; it didn't have the diversity it has now.","This was the first time a woman in Dallas had won public office of any kind - even women questioned whether or not I was qualified, whether or not I could take it.","During the election, I had three male opponents and we went into a runoff. The front runner for the men was a native of Dallas who had run at large before, but I had a higher profile than him from my community service.","I came up in a family oriented towards the sick, so I always felt an obligation for doing something.","Right after 9/11 there was a magazine with a cover of kids, mostly 12-14 year-olds, who were being trained for military combat. I thought that this had just gone too far.","Within a month I announced I was going to start this initiative: A World of Women for World Peace.","I said we needed to organize women around the world to push peace.","Our first phase was inviting all the women Ambassadors who were here from other countries and trying to get in touch with all the peace centers around the country in order to focus on increasing the volume and activity toward peace.","There are still traces of discrimination against race and gender, but it's a lot different than when I started out. It just comes quietly, slowly, sometimes so quietly that you don't realize it until you start looking back.","When you have this many losses, you don't have a following.","It takes ground activity to stimulate that Black vote.","We're going to have to look very seriously at what we're doing right or wrong because we just keep losing.","I'm not the only one who feels the sting of continually losing.","We have to think about the future and what it is we want to accomplish from this party.","As lawmakers, we must assure the people of America that our nation will not experience the nightmare of the 2000 presidential election.","We can't go all over the world killing people because we disagree with them."],"Eddie Bracken":["Oh, I'm a survivor. My whole life has been surviving.","I was in an awful lot of trouble in Hollywood.","But I have fun with the fright, work with it. You have to - that's your timing, that beat of excitement. And when I go on stage, it's just like taking a step into heaven. Poof, you know? Poof - and there I am.","Working with Sturges was like working with a guy who wanted to have a party all the time. He was very serious about his work, but in between shots, he was fun and we would play games."],"Eddie Cahill":["I love flexing theater muscles. Television has merits as well, but there's no substitute for live theater.","Everybody wants to get along with everyone else in the sandbox. I'm that kind of kid, you know what I mean? That will never change about me.","I went to a couple of Rangers games at the Garden, and someone at the NHL had seen me and figured I was a fan and decided to approach me about having a blog during the playoffs.","It was so popular, so more people identify me from 'Friends' than anything else.","I think we can all learn things if we really want to. It's fascinating how that can get expedited when you have a support system around you.","The 13-episode model lends itself to a more serialised format, which is nice and gives writers a chance to breathe some space into it."],"Eddie Campbell":["I remember having an argument with Alan, I said the Queen's not just going to call the guy up and send him out to do it. And Alan says, well, how would a monarch give orders to her assassin.","Dave Sim said in his latest thing of his, 'when you're on the right track, you'll know it, but until you get there, you have to believe you're on the right track'. Interesting little conundrum. It's not easy.","And when you look at the Turtle's movie there is something there, definitely something there.","All that political stuff Delano was doing. Me, I've gone off the top, into total fantasy.","I thought, well I can do that. I couldn't be bothered writing a book review, because I'd have to read the book, I haven't got time to read a whole book for a fifty dollar write-up.","They've got this house style which is writer driven. I heard of one person who sent his script in, and Karen Berger said there weren't enough words in it. Put some more in.","It's business, selling comics, you work out what sells and you don't want to muck about with it too much.","It's not the last one. Five's out, six is coming out in November, that's a single chapter, and then seven is the big horrifying one. And I think a couple after that to wrap the thing up.","I'm just drawing it now. It's totally revolting. I'm sure you'll love it.","You had to make an appointment to see her. But it was just a crazy spectacle, people filing past.","We could hang around for ten years and nobody would care enough to identify us. Therein lies the horror.","I think in the corridors of power these dangerous kinds of orders are issued in a much more vague way, passed down two or three levels of command before they're given to the assassin.","He would still see it as his duty to shut up and get on with it, not cause any trouble. In our own time we've made a hero of the rebel, and it's more heroic to speak up.","I'd be interested to read Gull's paper on it, and I wish Alan would put it in somewhere. It gives him a relevance to our times, which he doesn't otherwise have. Gull, I mean, not Alan.","I'm thinking to myself, I just love doing the art, it takes me a morning to do.","They asked me to write it and zoomed me over there to do it. But they ended up sacking me.","I wrote five issues of that and got the sack. Actually, they paid me for eight, but they changed their minds about the direction and threw three issues out the window.","I don't want to write, I'd rather draw.","There are a couple of things in there if we're constraining this discussion to horror here.","I came in on the decline. Phil Elliot was in first, he got his book out, he sold thirteen thousand, I think he got two issues out before I got mine in, this was March '87. He was out in December '86.","By March '87 we're down to seven thousand, by the end of the year we're down to twelve hundred. The whole bottom just fell out of the market. It was bad for me because I was in Australia at the time."],"Eddie Cantor":["Slow down and enjoy life. It's not only the scenery you miss by going to fast - you also miss the sense of where you are going and why.","A wedding is a funeral where you smell your own flowers.","It takes 20 years to make an overnight success.","Marriage is an attempt to solve problems together which you didn't even have when you were on your own.","When I see the Ten Most Wanted Lists... I always have this thought: If we'd made them feel wanted earlier, they wouldn't be wanted now."],"Eddie Cibrian":["You cannot imagine how great it is to step out on the stage with thousands of screaming fans loving you.","I think there are some people who are just kind of born to create drama and then capitalise on it.","I crave attention and adventure.","I love my boys very much. I want only the best for them and am committed to being a devoted father."],"Eddie Condon":["Someday we may have as many followers as the harpsichord.","As it enters the ear, does it come in like broken glass or does it come in like honey?"],"Eddie Floyd":["I go out with my band six months of the year and the rest of them with the Blues Brothers.","I never thought I'd get a chance to sing with Wilson Pickett but we did.","I was just about 6 weeks old when we moved to Detroit.","The groups, though, were my inspiration way back then. I liked Frankie Lyman and the Teenagers.","Oh yeah, I know Johnnie Bassett. We were part of that whole thing.","People know me for up-tempo songs because of my hits.","Everybody had their fans and they were fans of all of them."],"Eddie Guerrero":["If you're not cheating, you're not trying.","How can you beat someone that's already lost everything?","To me, wrestling is therapy. No matter how bad my personal situation is, when I step into the ring, all my troubles disappear. My baggage stays in the back where it belongs.","Since the day I was born, wrestling has sustained me and my family. It's the way my father fed me; it's the way I feed my kids. More importantly, wrestling is my greatest release. It's been such a blessing for me. I can step into the ring and let it all go - all my anger, all my frustration, all my pain.","I was miserable in WCW. I knew I wasn't going to go any higher there, and jumping to WWE hadn't even crossed my mind. I couldn't stop wondering, 'Is this it? Is this what I worked my whole life for?'","I honestly can't describe what goes on in my head when I'm out there. People who don't wrestle can't possibly understand it. When I'm in the ring, I don't feel any pain. I'm in another world out there.","I lie, I cheat, and I steal."],"Eddie Huang":["People talk about perfect timing, but I think everything is perfect in its moment; you just want to capture that.","I'm so sick of people misunderstanding Asians in America and what we're about.","Sundays are for Dim Sum. While the rest of America goes to church, Sunday School, or NFL games, you can find Chinese people eating Cantonese food.","I wanted to inspire people not to work under a bamboo ceiling. Whatever you are - yellow, black, white, brown - you don't have to allow your skin to define who you are or how you operate your business. There's not one face to anything.","I don't think people in America understand race, and how deep the hooks of whiteness there are in our consciousness.","I want to prove you don't need to have academic syntax to be intelligent.","When I feel off, I read the 'Tao Te Ching' to get my equilibrium right. I started reading it in the eleventh grade.","I wasn't meant to be an attorney, but I was meant to go to law school.","I saw an opportunity to use a restaurant to identify a lot of my issues and concerns with being an immigrant in America, and Asian in America, and a young person in America.","I had no desire to be a chef, but I had a desire to be someone who was heard.","There is a lot of food culture that goes on in the home and in the community in non-traditional ways. Food is a lot more than restaurants.","For me, juicing isn't about binging and cleansing; I try to incorporate it into a balanced diet.","I get so disenfranchised reading the news, because global borders and lines we've created are completely unnecessary. That's just another person on the other side, and it's his bad luck that he was born there and it's my good fortune that I was born here. It's all kind of illogical.","I don't want to get burned when I'm cooking. To avoid getting hit when pan-frying, I stand far away and use chopsticks that are almost two feet long. I learned it from my mom, who does the same thing.","I'll always be Chinese first. It probably isn't politically correct to say or something that the majority understands; I can change my shoes, I can swap my passport, but, I'll always have this face.","I'll always be American in my world view and allegiance. American in the naive way I go to other countries and tell them how they should treat their poor or clean their water.","I choose to be American, I choose to live in the Lower East Side of Manhattan, I choose to have Puerto Rican/Jewish neighbors, and I choose to maintain my Chinese identity.","I have more to say as a writer than from behind a wok.","My only goal as a comedian was to stomp the life out of the model-minority myth.","I don't like labels. I don't understand the need for them. When you define yourself a certain way, people have expectations.","Black culture has been a huge influence in my life.","New York felt to me like what America should be - a representation of the world in this small pocket.","I like being on camera, performing, seeing what people have in common.","I want everybody to run at the same speed as me. But some people are more conscientious, they think more and they plan more. And they're more careful.","BaoHaus is idiosyncratic, creative, and artistic. My restaurant doesn't look like a Taiwanese restaurant.","I like a walking culture; I need to be in a city where you can walk everywhere.","I've never said I was a chef - I think I make great food. I will never open a restaurant to do, like, tasting courses.","But what I'm very interested in, whether it's writing, whether it's hosting a show, whether it's cooking food, I'm just into the discussions of identity, culture and the politics of culture.","I blog because I have something to say.","I don't think people understand the model-minority stereotype is negative. You are boxed in. You have to untangle that to find your own path."],"Eddie Izzard":["Never put a sock in a toaster.","Cats have a scam going - you buy the food, they eat the food, they go away; that's the deal.","MAC gave me 55 lipsticks to test. These are the same lipsticks I got caught stealing by the police when I was 15. How ironic.","I just believe in the goodwill of people, the power of people to do something positive.","Boy bands should be exploded from a great height. They're just pretty people singing music written by others.","If you've never seen an elephant ski, you've never been on acid.","Well, comedy is a great weapon of attack. It's not a great weapon of support.","Religion and philosophy, philosophy and religion - they're two words which are both... different. In spelling.","I use a Bruce Lee technique: 'The way of no way.' He had the idea that he would learn everything, so that whoever he had to fight, he could improvise anything. The best way of starting a gig is just to not think of anything - to clear your mind, not in an empty Zen state, but more just to go on and see where you go.","I mean, sometimes... a comedian becomes an actor, and they just don't deliver, because the bottom line of comedy is to be funny, and the bottom line of acting is to be truthful, and they get that mixed up sometimes, or don't even notice that that's the thing.","I felt audiences are happier to take comedy people who play darker people because there's a link between the psychosis of comedy and the psychosis of being a twisted character.","I'm quite good at taking in information so I voraciously inhale Wikipedia - which may have some things wrong in it, but I think is generally more information than we had before. Last tour we didn't have Wikipedia. And then Discovery Channel and History Channel. I can take it in and retain what I think are the most important facts.","I like my coffee like I like my women. In a plastic cup.","I wanna live 'til I die, no more, no less.","I'm a one-man idiot.","There was no religion in my life growing up. Did God invent us or did we invent God?","So the American government lied to the Native Americans for many, many years, and then President Clinton lied about a relationship, and everyone was surprised! A little naive, I feel!","They tend to come out a colour called 'Pants left in wash'","I grew up in Europe, where the history comes from.","I don't know what it's like in the U.S. but immigrants in the U.K. do the jobs the citizens won't do.","Animals in the wild are lean, and I think we should be too.","I'd be happy to be taken as a woman - and that's what I was initially trying to do when I started throwing on dresses and stuff. But that wasn't going to happen because everyone kept calling me sir. So I thought I'd change the method and just start wearing what I wanted to wear.","I try to keep performing as much as possible - I just like to. I used to take huge gaps off between gigs, now I just like to do stand-up gigs as much as I can.","If you go down as a comedian's comedian, that's basically meaning other comedians are hopefully feeling that you're doing okay.","I wanted to be less well-known in comedy.","In stand-up it really helps to play yourself and talk about your own feelings. You cannot fail to be original if you're just talking about what you think about X, Y and Z. Unless you've got a twin brother who's also a stand-up.","I try to just talk about human stories and what I think about religion or teapots or whatever.","If there is a God, his plan is very similar to someone not having a plan.","My stand-up is quite good now, people say. It's just like a big conversation each time. Every gig is a rehearsal.","If you get anything creative going, then the work and play thing is the same thing, I feel.","I don't believe that competitions are important.","Comedy is a great weapon of attack. It's not a great weapon of support."],"Eddie Jones":["We got guys who can score. Everybody knows guys can score.","Home court changes everything. If you have home court, you're expected to win.","Homecourt is everything in the NBA."],"Eddie Kaye Thomas":["Everyone seems to relate to the awkwardness of being a teenager, or even a 30-year-old.","If I have the TV on, it's either a Mets game or 'SportsCenter.'","I read a lot of news online, but I like buying a paper because I'll read an article I wouldn't normally read. And more often than not, the articles that you don't expect to care about are the ones that grab you.","I am a Facebook voyeur. I feel bad about it because I never put anything on there, but I find it fun to sit there and watch peoples' lives go by. Or whatever lives they're presenting.","What's great about HBO is they just care about quality. They care about the brand. They're not worried about ratings; obviously they want people to buy subscriptions, but they just want people to be into what's on HBO.","Editing and post-production is so important with comedy.","The fact of the matter is, it's hard to find good movies, period.","I've been lucky enough to be too busy for TV because if I'm not, I'll get stuck in front of it.","When you have an iPad and 75 books on it, it's so easy to go, 'I'm bored, I'm just going to read something else.'","I've been working on 'The New York Times' crossword puzzle on the subway. I can make it until about Wednesday."],"Eddie Marsan":["With a face like mine, I'm never going to play a character who conquers the universe, I'm going to play characters who are subject to forces bearing down on them. My career's based on how we are rather than how we wish we were - they get the good-looking boys in for that kind of role.","What I love about the East End is that there's a great perseverance, determination and courage. What I dislike about it is that there is sometimes a celebration of ignorance.","I've got four kids to feed and a wife to provide for. It's a worry but a great responsibility as well and one I relish.","The trick to acting is not to show off, it's to think the thoughts of the character.","I sometimes think if I had gone to Oxford or Cambridge and looked like a handsome young guy who could be in an Evelyn Waugh novel or something, I'd be a massive movie star. But there's a longevity to what I do. It's more reliable. Someone isn't deciding that I'm the next big thing.","I've got four kids - I unblock a toilet every day.","When I was a struggling actor, I worked for a party company. One of my friends from school was working for an advertising agency, and I turned up to one of his company's parties dressed as an alien to collect tickets on the door.","As children, we all hold on to the myth of omnipotence. Comics are successful because kids identify with superheroes. They'll read a book or watch a TV programme and say, 'I'm that guy.' And that guy is always the one in control.","My business is not to show anybody anything; my job is just to do it.","I consciously decided not to be a 'London' actor. Those gangster movies made a lot of East End actors think they were movie stars. And I was very aware that they were going to go out of fashion.","I have friends who are leading men, and they're only ever allowed to play leading men of a certain type. But as a character actor, there's a wider variety of projects available. On the big Hollywood films, all they care about is having their lead in place, so it's actually easier for someone like me to slip in. And I'm happy to do so.","When you're the youngest and the only boy, you get spoilt but you get told you're spoilt so you don't get to enjoy it very much. I was the only man in the house because my parents divorced and my dad moved away when I was 13.","There's no great mystery to acting. It's a very simple thing to do but you have to work hard at it. It's about asking questions and using your imagination.","I went swimming the other day and my wife was watching and she said, 'You know, it's funny, it's when you've got no clothes on, no one recognizes you.' I said, 'What are you saying? That I should do more love scenes?'","I used to do a lot of comedy. I don't know what happened. I think it's my face.","I see all these people talking about acting as a great spiritual thing. It's not. There's no great mystery to acting. It's a very simple thing to do, but you have to work hard at it. It's about asking questions and using your imagination.","The trick to acting is not to show off; it's to think the thoughts of the character. I was lucky because when I started acting, it was doing jobs above pubs. I learned to act in anonymity, so by the time people saw me, I knew what I was doing. I was crap for years, but no one saw me being crap. It's a trade you learn.","I'm used to being in front of camera and knowing what to think. But if you're asking me to be me, I get very self-conscious. My job isn't to be me. Being an actor, people think you can do a eulogy at a funeral, a speech at a wedding. I find all that very nerve-racking.","I want to be respected as an actor. There's my ego. But I don't have a great need to be liked by an audience.","I come from a place where there's violence and inarticulacy. I worked in a pub from the age of 12 or 13. I used to see people smashing glasses over each other. I was never tough. I was scared of them.","I was approached to do something for seven years, and it was a quality project. I did seriously think about it, but I didn't want to be away for six months of the year. I've never done the L.A. thing where you go and have loads of meetings; I can't say to my wife, 'I'm going to wait by a pool for six months.'","When I think of character actors, I think of Spencer Tracy; I think of Gene Hackman, Robert Duvall. When I was a young lad watching films, my eyes were on them - watching 'On the Waterfront,' my eyes are on Rod Steiger and Karl Malden, not on Brando.","I've never played a gay character on screen, so that would be interesting. I've never played a gay character, and that would fascinate me because I'm not gay, so that would interest me.","I'd love to play a Bond villain. Yeah, I'd love to play a Bond villain. Everyone always says this to me; they always say, 'You've got to be a Bond villain', 'We're going to make you a Bond villain...' But they've never, ever approached me, I've never had a whiff of it. I think I'd love to play a Bond villain; I'd have great fun.","I'm not one of these actors who can make a bad script good. Some actors, a script can be terrible, and they can bring something to it and make it really special. I can't.","My idea is just to do something different each time; the next thing I do has to be completely different to the thing I've done before - that's what I try and do, because you know, I'm an actor, not a film star.","I wanted to work with Bryan Singer because I like his films.","I was brought up in a house full of women; the first time I realised no one was interrupting me was when I was on stage - that's probably the subconscious reason I became an actor.","I wasn't one of the ones voted most likely to succeed when I was at drama school, but I persevered and concentrated on the acting rather than going to the right parties and getting the right agent. Eventually, after ten years, it paid off.","Mike Leigh taught me about making choices - as an actor, you choose between being honest and clever, and with Mike, it's always about being honest. I learned how to behave on a film set from Jim Broadbent. He was a great example of someone with a fantastic career who kept his feet on the ground.","I'm the guy who plays human beings. I understand why the characters are doing what they're doing. When you play a villain, you don't play a villain: you play a human being doing what he thinks he needs to do to get what he wants.","Different races never fazed me because coming from Bethnal Green, I'd been around people of different races forever. Different class? That was much harder.","As a working-class actor, leaving school with no qualifications, being a printer and then becoming an actor and then working with people who to a certain extent had had a leg up. I never had that advantage. It's less an artistic need to express myself and more a need to prove myself.","I love the fact that everyone's trying to be good-looking in L.A. - then I turn up and I get work.","I'm used to playing characters who have a lot to say but don't know how to say it.","The characters in 'Ray Donovan' are not very articulate - we're the worst Irish family you could ever live next to in L.A.","Magic symbolises the subconscious - that part of us that is creative and powerful that we sometimes don't tap into.","I always think of Gilbert Norrell as being Salieri to Jonathan Strange being Mozart.","I'm not a great fiction reader. I love history. I love history and philosophy.","Mr. Norrell is like a librarian trying to do magic... That's the story of my career, really. I stand next to good looking men and make them look better!","It's a very fascinating thing for an actor to play somebody who is suffering, and you have to express the suffering, but in an inarticulate way and sometimes a dysfunctional way, through violence.","I wouldn't have been interested in making a show just about Hollywood, 'cause I find Hollywood boring. I find people and families very interesting.","When you watch 'Ray Donovan,' you think that it's about Hollywood, about scandal, about stars, and about trying to keep secrets. That's true, but that's also just the means by which you reveal secrets of the people suffering every day life.","Private education can give you confidence, which is marvellous; a sense of entitlement isn't.","If you're confident, then it helps you live up to your potential, but if you believe because you went to a certain school it means you're entitled to have a particular career, you'll fall flat on your face eventually.","I come from a council estate in Tower Hamlets, and by no means am I the only person who has done well - one of my friends is head of year in a great school in Twickenham. Another is a writer; another is an artist, a musician.","I thought 'Lock Stock' was a good film. I thought 'Lock Stock' was a good film because I think it was a one-off before it was imitated a hundred times.","My career is playing the guys who go, 'Boo.' That's what I do.","I could not be one of those actors who stays in character all day long. I'd go mad.","If your character doesn't express himself or doesn't feel confident expressing himself, then you don't express yourself.","When I was doing fringe theatre, my ambition was to do repertory. When I got to rep it was to do national theatre; then it was t,o get a couple of parts in television. I never had this great desire to overreach myself. I was too busy enjoying acting. I was just obsessed with it.","I know what I try to do. I try to be professional, turn up, not make too much fuss, do the job.","I'm like a mechanic. If you break down and phone the AA, they'll come to you whether it's raining or snowing. That's what an actor should do.","I have my career and my family, and that's it.","You turn up on set, and somebody who has come out of Oxford, has done a BBC course, is telling you how to act. You think, 'Do me a favour. Go and make a coffee.'","I didn't do well at school, and I don't have lots of academic reference points.","I knew very early on that I wasn't Brad Pitt.","I knew what kind of actor I was going to be, and I looked for inspiration to people like Alec Guinness, Cyril Cusack, Timothy Spall and Jim Broadbent. I looked at them and thought, 'They play human beings as they really are.'","'Ray Donovan' is very dark and very serious. As actors will tell you, the darker and more serious the material, the more jokes that go around set. It's a counterbalance.","The hardest thing to do and most miserable films are comedies.","I'm very blue collar myself. So it was easy for me to embody that in a sense. It's much harder for me to embody Norrell than it is to embody Terry Donovan.","I'm a great believer that actors are very similar to session musicians. You wouldn't ask a session musician, 'How do you play jazz,' and then, 'How do you play classical?' They just do it, because if they don't do it, they don't eat.","Art is the job of the privileged.","You can't write a screenplay if you've been doing a zero-hours contract. Which means that the people who write drama, the people who commission dramas, and the people who direct dramas all come from a small circle of society.","You're not going to have something set on a council estate that explores all elements of human existence, the variety of experience inherent in any community.","I always define egotistical thoughts as the thoughts I think other people have of me.","If you leave me waiting 'round for hours and then call on me to do something, I need to be able to do it straight away. That's my job, like your job is to do what you do.","When I first started doing press, one of the things people started pushing was this idea that I'd somehow escaped something. And I was really offended, because I hadn't escaped anything.","My friends I grew up with were so supportive to me. And I'm not the only one who's done well.","I love Bethnal Green and where I'm from. Nothing there, especially the people, ever held me back, but I never felt that I was successful there.","I wasn't that hard. I wasn't that tough. I wasn't that funny - I looked like me.","Acting was a way of me finding myself, which I think is the case of a lot of actors, regardless of where they come from.","Paddy Considine is a great friend of mine, and he is a natural actor because he is an artist, and I'm not an artist. If I ever blow my own trumpet, it's as a craftsman.","I don't look like Brad Pitt or Tom Cruise. When you put me on the screen, the women don't want to make love to me, and the men don't want to be me.","I get a lot of people saying to me, 'Oh, you're the actor who plays the nutters,' and I'm not. I'm the guy who plays human beings. I understand why the characters are doing what they're doing. When you play a villain, you don't play a villain: you play a human being doing what he thinks he needs to do to get what he wants.","I listen to a lot of jazz. I'm a big Sinatra geek. I love Chet Baker.","I had a good job as a printer in the East End. Before the unions destroyed it, that job was very lucrative.","Major film stars tend to do a film and then have a couple of months off. I'm not a major film star; I'm a jobbing actor."],"Eddie Mathews":["It's only a hitch when you're in a slump. When you're hitting the ball its called rhythm.","I don't know where Hank Aaron will break Ruth's record but I can tell you one thing - ten years from the day he hits it three million people will say they were there."],"Eddie McClintock":["I just want to be able to have fun, make a living, feed my family and create something that I'm proud of, and I'm all those things. It's great.","Anytime you spend 15 or 16 hours a day with someone, five days a week for six months, that's more time than some people spend with their own families, so it does affect the dynamic between the actors.","When I decided to be an actor, years ago, I just said, 'Look, I'm not going to do this unless I can be the best,' but I don't know what 'the best' is.","I grew up wrestling and playing football where, at the end of the game, you have a score and you're either the winner of loser. There's no score in acting, but you qualify your level of success by the people that you work with and the amount of exposure that you have.","You know, I Google search my own name because I'm so self-obsessed!","I was supposed to go see Led Zeppelin when I was in, like, the 8th or 9th grade, and then John Bonham died and I never was able to. For me, music is such a huge part of my life, and I use songs like memory triggers. So a lot of my memories of being a kid and growing up are associated with different songs.","Comedy is a comfortable yet challenging place for me. I will always feel an inner pressure to do my best and to improve."],"Eddie Money":["To me, the glass is always half full, never half empty.","I still do a bit of this and a bit of that. Some brews and there's nothing wrong with a bud or two! I still do a bit of this and a bit of that. Some brews and there's nothing wrong with a bud or two!","I'm younger than Rod Stewart and Bruce Springsteen, but I'm still getting up there in age.","It's very important to give back to the community and do anything you can.","I love L.A. for the beach and stuff, that's the reason I live here.","I'm not trying to stay in the same place and I'm not trying to compete with what's currently in fashion. That would be dishonest. But, at the same time, I'm different and the music reflects that to some degree.","I've always loved the blues, John Lee Hooker, Janis Joplin, Hendrix.","You look at Sinatra, Tony Bennett, Bob Seger. All they ever wanted to do was go out there and entertain, and I'm the same way."],"Eddie Murphy":["The advice I would give to someone is to not take anyone's advice.","I've always had confidence. It came because I have lots of initiative. I wanted to make something of myself.","I'm 42 and the age of a guy who has kids, so I guess I'm playing right where I'm supposed to be. I'm comfortable with that, but in the same breath I'd do something edgy. If someone came to me and offered me an edgy and funny story, then I'd do it.","I haven't read a newspaper in 20 years. I don't look at the computer or anything. You have to have a filter on what you let in.","The studios gotta start making more stuff where black folks get quality stuff. But I can't trip about that because I've been making movies for 35 years, and I've played everything from an old lady to a donkey, so I can't be on here talking about, 'They don't give us enough roles' and diversity.","However wack anyone thought 'Whatzupwitu' was, there's not a lot of people that have footage of themselves dancing around in the clouds with Michael Jackson. I do have that forever.","If I don't die in a plane crash or something, this country has a rare opportunity to watch a great talent grow.","The thing about kids is that they express emotion. They don't hold back. If they want to cry, they cry, and if they are in a good mood, they're in a good mood.","In the original script, my character was a basketball player rather than a boxer. I didn't think I could pull that off. I'm a little short to be a basketball player!","I'm in a position that allows me to do what I want to do, and I do it.","Every now and then, when I think about it, I think, 'What would I even talk about onstage?' It's never been, 'I wonder if I'm funny. I wonder if I can come up with jokes.' It's more, 'What would it be like without the leather suit and the anger?'","I only want to do what I really want to do; otherwise, I'm content to sit here and play my guitar all day.","I started out as an impressionist and that's all about observing - how people move, their voice quality, their attitudes and quirks.","After all these years, I've done well and I'm cool. I feel comfortable in my skin, I've saved some paper, everybody's healthy, my kids are beautiful and smart, doing different things, it's all good.","You know, if you look all my stuff... If you go back to 'Saturday Night Live,' my stuff always has music, even a bunch of my comedy stuff - like in 'Shrek,' the donkey is always singing. Music is always there.","Being on 'SNL' gives you a unique experience that almost no one else has. It's like Harvard for the comic actor.","The economy in Ireland has been rampaging ahead for the last 15 years. Barring an international, political or natural catastrophe, things can only get better for the Irish.","As you get older, you get different, and I'm a mushier, softer person as I get older.","I'm a comedian who got into movies, so I don't really think of myself as an actor.","There's this little box that African-American actors have to work in, in the first place, and I was able to rise above that box. I could have done a bunch of movies where I stayed as the Axel Foley or Reggie Hammond persona. But I didn't want to be doing the same thing all the time. Every now and then, you crash and burn, but that's part of it.","Ultimately, when I go back to the stage, I want to be able to do everything. I want to be able to do music and comedy and all that stuff; that's what all this stuff is leading to.","I think I have enough of a sense to know what works for me and what doesn't, without going into some big thing and analyzing what I do. I'm in a position that allows me to do what I want to do, and I do it.","From the very beginning, I always tried to make dialogue flow comfortably; I always did that to make it seem more authentic.","I started out as a stand-up comedian. And that's what I'm most comfortable doing.","Making movies is time-consuming and it's boring. You spend most of your time waiting between takes. It's like a big machine that moves slowly.","If you have a flop movie, so what? And if you have a hit movie, it's 'so what,' too - it's on to the next movie.","I love the Beatles.","You know why they think I'm reclusive? I don't do the Hollywood stuff. I've never been on the circuit.","I've been a big Bob Marley fan forever. Forever. Like big, huge. Bob Marley and the Beatles, that's my big, giant music influence. I can listen to them all the time.","Growing up, I liked all the stuff that everyone else was listening to, like Motown, but the biggest group of all was The Beatles.","I'd like to produce, direct, write, score, and star in a film in exactly the way Chaplin did. I'll do that before I'm thirty.","I don't think more concentration is required for Robert De Niro to do what he does as for Jim Carrey to do what he does.","In a movie like this, the relationship between the two guys is crucial. It sinks or swims on how these two guys are together. I think we did a good job.","I'm relaxed about my career. I've been making movies for over 20 years, so I've earned at least the right to relax.","You know, making a movie is a collaborative effort and sometimes all the ingredients don't work out. I know that every now and again I am going to make a movie that won't work.","I've made 30 movies and for the most part my movies work. In a business where success is an exception and not the rule, I've mostly been successful.","If you're involved in with something that's original, you know, you'll always go back and try to rehash it.","I keep telling people I'll make movies until I'm fifty and then I'll go and do something else. I'm going to be a professional gentleman of leisure.","I leave my house all the time! But I'm not at all the Hollywood parties. I'm grown, and where else am I supposed to be? I'm supposed to be home.","I'm the artist when I'm doing music that I am when I'm acting. I'm everything.","My first concert makes me sound like a real old man. My very first concert was Jackie Wilson.","Music has always been around with me.","I stopped doing standup because it stopped being fun. And the reason it stopped being fun was it was harder to write - and this was before the Internet - it was harder to write new stuff. It had gotten so crazy.","I used to be the hippest of them all. I used to know everything about everything. I used to read about everything that was going on, and I knew everybody's name and anybody in pop culture. Anything that was written about me, I would read.","'Nutty Professor' was me going, 'Say what you want to say, but I can do this, and you can't, and nobody else in the town can do this.'","Getting divorced didn't sour me on the institution of marriage. I'll tell you what I'll never do: I'll never get divorced again.","The same way you can see me sit at a table in a movie and be six different people, the mother and the uncle and all these different things, when I'm in the studio, I can do that, too. I'm not trying to be a recording artist and have a certain type of music for the radio.","I'm not performing anymore. I reveal myself to the audience. I reveal myself. That's the show now.","I don't know what my Death Row meal would be. I'm surprised that people can even eat when they're on Death Row.","I'm kind of long in the tooth to fly in in a cape now, so I'd have to be, like, the voice of reason or somebody. 'Don't do that, super-fellow!'","I love 'Trading Places,' but 'Coming to America' has one of the things I like to do - I like the multiple characters.","I can go to a country song, go right into it and make it sound authentic. And I think that's because of my ear as an impressionist.","I had a band before I did standup - I've always done music. I got known for being funny, and that's how I make a living - and from acting - but I never stopped playing and producing and recording music.","There's a bunch of places in the world I haven't been to, 'cause I can only be on a plane for a little bit. I'm like, 'How long is it to get there? Two days on a plane? What? No.'","'SNL' is part of my history. I got on the show as a kid. That's the show I got known from.","If you interact with anyone, ultimately, all people are the same. However they're dressed, when you're in the house with a person, they're going to be a regular human being.","I never hated hip-hop. It became the new rock and roll. It became the biggest thing that Africans have ever done in the history of the Americas. Hip-hop put more black Americans on than anything before it. It fed more people. It allowed them to diversify into clothing lines and billion-dollar headphone companies."],"Eddie Murray":["Today I join the greatest players that played the game. It is a great feeling being here.","You win as a team, you lose as a team, you also do so many things together.","When Ted Williams was here, inducted into the Hall of Fame 37 years ago, he said he must have earned it, because he didn't win it because of his friendship with the writers. I guess in that way, I'm proud to be in this company that way.","When I signed a contract, I was here to play 162 games.","No one was more important than my mom and dad. I know they are watching from a place up in heaven here today to make sure all their kids are doing good.","It makes you feel at home when you can talk to somebody and really talk about anything.","I'm proud to be here as a man that has played first base more than anybody in the game of baseball.","I'm now the hitting the instructor with the Cleveland Indians.","I learned life from some good teachers.","For me, baseball is about, again, the team winning.","Baseball is a team game.","And, you know, you try and preach to them there's more to this game than just walking up to home plate, swinging the bat, fielding a ground ball. There's some dedication in it, some love you've got to put into this work.","And like I said, I appreciate my older brothers because they would not allow me to win. They made me learn to play with them, which I think is the most important thing that I learned.","And I tell you that's one of the reasons why I didn't have the friendships with the media, maybe like I could have. But I had to do what I had to do to make myself successful.","I don't wish I did anything differently. The most important thing to me was to play baseball."],"Eddie Obeng":["In the 21st century, somebody or something has changed the rules about how our world works.","We solve last year's problems without thinking about the future.","If you haven't understood the world you're living in, it's impossible to think that the solution you're coming up with fits.","We spend our time responding rationally to a world which we understand and recognize, but which no longer exists."],"Eddie Perez":["Pouring concrete on land you don't own is called a calculated risk, if you don't pour you loose millions.","You're either with me or you're not. And if you're not, you're out.","Ninety percent of the people I grew up with didn't succeed.","At 21 years old, I could produce 400 people like that.","A lapse in judgment is not a crime.","My energy level has not changed."],"Eddie Plank":["There are only so many pitches in this old arm, and I don't believe in wasting them throwing to first base.","I am through with baseball forever. I have my farm and my home and enough to take care of me, so why should I work and worry any longer?"],"Eddie Redmayne":["The question of what it is to live an 'authentic life', that's a complicated one.","What an extraordinary thing it can be, love, how it will not defined by gender, by sexuality, by race, by religion, by anything. It's something else. It's something other.","I walk around talking to myself in accents. Usually people look at me like I'm a complete fruit loop.","I always try to describe making movies like summer camp, or some holiday where you spend all day, every day with a new group of people whom you kind of love and then never see again.","I try genuinely, when I'm playing a character, to not judge them and just to inhabit someone as how one sees them. That being said, you also want to make sure that you don't blur the edges of people too much because humans are naughty and complicated beings.","If gender is on a spectrum, where one finds oneself is completely unique.","Velvet is great. It's warm as well. And it's snug.","There is a certain amount of commerce in the film industry in as much as you have value, and for a moment, your value goes up, then it all disappears again.","I had never been to a fashion show before going to the Burberry show last month. It was an extraordinary spectacle. I was incredibly green and had no idea what an undertaking it is. I also have a new respect for models because they are so close to the front row and must be so self-conscious.","When you're doing a film that has so many effects, you do a lot of it on green screen, and you can't see what that world is.","Going to the Oscars is always the most sensory overload and a huge amount of fun.","I've never been someone that was sort of blessed with an innate talent of just being able to do things. I had to work at it and learn from mistakes.","It can be a miserable profession, acting, because you always want what you can't have.","Listen, acting is not surgery, it's entertainment. You're doing something to hopefully move people, to make them laugh, to transport them. But actors are vulnerable, and the reason we're vulnerable is that we're always trying to recreate human behaviour.","That's the reality of my life - I do normal things and then get to go to film festivals and wear borrowed clothes and turn up at premieres and talk about things I am passionate about. But then you click back to normality and your family and friends.","I'm trying to buy a house and set some sense of roots because otherwise you're constantly chasing one job after another, and you look back and you've had all these very extraordinary experiences with extraordinary people, but there's not a line of continuity to it.","I wish I could describe anything I do as conscious or strategized. To be honest, in acting, you have so little control. The only control you have is if you're lucky enough to be in a position, which is not very often, in which you have choice. It's about what choices you make, and for me, it's entirely instinctive.","I'm quite ignorant about fashion and I'm colourblind, so it's all a tad tricky. My only knowledge of that world comes through Christopher Bailey, whom I first met in 2008 when I did a campaign for Burberry that featured musicians, artists, actors and sportsmen.","If I do a film and have to get naked, that tends to dictate how often I go to the gym. Acting in 'Richard II' on stage was a huge physical workout, so I ended up more toned than I normally am.","I do get stopped a bit now and then, but I can go to the supermarket and on the Tube without being noticed. It's usually me that gets starstruck, especially by TV stars.","What's really interesting about actors, is that we all have opinions on how people's careers look, but I think you never have any idea of your own, or what other people think of you.","I think all actors have a similar deal. You want some people who understand. Although it looks great - and is great - there are also shoddy moments when you feel really rotten, and when it's going well, you're not allowed to complain.","I have this horrific thing where I'm really bad with names and faces. I have an appalling memory. Someone will come up to me in the street and go, 'Eddie!', and I'll try and give myself time by going into overdrive, 'Hey, hi! Nice to see you!' and start a whole conversation because I can't distinguish between who I know and who I don't.","When I was living in New York, I had this slightly wannabe bohemian existence and took up painting, at which I'm appalling. I also bought several guitars.","I did an interview once where I was asked who I found attractive and I went on about cartoons and Nala from 'The Lion King' - and it's a bit weird but various of my ex-girlfriends actually did look like Nala.","As an actor there's a lot of scrutiny and, even when you've had success, it becomes about sustaining that success. A friend of mine described it as a peakless mountain. Even for De Niro there's Pacino and for Pacino there's De Niro.","Most actors hate watching their own films because all you can see is the glaring mistakes, your own tricks and ticks.","My first film, 'Like Minds,' was with Toni Colette, who was extraordinary. I mean it was basically a mini-masterclass for acting on film at a time when all you could probably see were my eyebrows bouncing up and down on screen.","Ladies and babies, and mortgages, for that matter, can all wait. Acting has done a strange thing to me, though. I often sit there, thinking, 'I love this, but I wouldn't put my daughter on the stage.'","They're such hierarchical things, film sets, they're sort of mini societies. Often they're incredibly political places.","Making a film or doing a play are completely different experiences and entirely fulfilling, but completely unique. I also think one complements the other. People often say that theater is about flexing your muscles, and is actually real acting, whereas I sort of disagree.","Everything about filmmaking is incredibly weird, and there's nothing natural about watching yourself on the big screen or hearing your voice. It's that same thing that you feel when you watch yourself on a video camera and you hate the sound of your voice - it's that times 800.","A lot of people think theatre must be much harder work than film, but anything histrionic or superfluous gets seen on camera so you have to work to distil it into a complete sense of what's true.","And you can't complain about kissing Emma Watson. Isn't that what everyone in the world wants to do? I've known Emma for a few years. She's this amazing capacity of young and vibrant and brilliant, but also a bright, intelligent old soul.","If you're an English actor and turn up in America, they don't have an opinion about where you sit. They have no idea what auditions to send you to, so they send you to everything.","It's the weird thing Eton does - you're at school next to lords and earls and, in my case, Prince William, so you end up being used to dealing with those sorts of people.","Two years ago, I shot 'Pillars of the Earth' in Budapest - it was a big part, but I had a lot of time to sit around and visit cafes.","Making 'Birdsong,' on the one hand you have how prestigious it is and the reputation of the book, which is something that's an extraordinary piece of work. Sebastian Faulkes is a genius. So you feel that responsibility when you're portraying that character that he's imagined and millions of readers have pictured.","As a runner on a film, you are the lowest of the low, and yet you have incredible access to everyone. I can totally imagine that for actors in the middle of a Hollywood bubble, all they really want is a sense of normality, and that gopher can be a tap for that.","On so many levels, acting in film and TV is so much the sum of its parts, and somewhere in there, there's an alchemical thing that makes something happen or not - that makes something connect or not. Now, of course you want to make work that people see, but the enjoyment I get out of acting is playing characters.","If your dream is to tell stories, interesting stories, play interesting people, that's the bottom line. The people that I play have to be extraordinary.","I come home from trying to pretend to know about astronomy and physics all day and turn on 'The Real Housewives'.","I've been a closet lover of faux-reality TV since 'The Hills'. It's bad.","I never really committed to being an actor. It never felt like it would be possible, I guess.","Filming is about continuing to be alert and to think, and I find it quite exhausting.","I've played women since I was a kid and I've always enjoyed it.","There's something scary about acting always, because basically you do all this work in a vacuum, and then suddenly there's a lot of money spent making a film, and there's suddenly a camera here, going, 'Right? What are you gonna do?'","There's been a huge history of cisgender success on the back of trans stories, which is something I'm deeply aware of. My take on it, I suppose, was that I do think actors should be able to play anything.","I am fascinated by Omega's history. Particularly the First World War stuff, when they made watches for the flying corps, and the NASA side of it.","I suffer from a more complex, persistent fear. It manifests itself in nerves, and on film the camera sees even the tiniest evidence of this. So you have to learn that when the director calls 'Action,' you don't go to this place of tension, but somehow you become free.","I find in film acting that however many years you have done it for, you can feel totally relaxed and at ease with the people around you, absolutely wonderful, then roll camera and a little part of you goes, 'Ugh'. It is learning how to manage that.","The percentage of actors employed is pretty small, and if you're lucky enough to have a good run at it, you do have a sense of responsibility.","I'm by nature someone that quite likes to understand how things are working, likes some sense of structure, and I've fallen into the worst possible trade for that.","Actors are actors, and there should be a complete fluidity for anyone to play anything.","For a year after I left Cambridge, I had an agent, and I was working in a pub and doing waitering. But I could stay at home rent-free.","For 'The Theory of Everything,' I was quite low down on a list of actors for the role, and I got the opportunity as a consequence of people saying no to it. So I have been very, very lucky.","I feel like J. K. Rowling's world is one that is owned by everyone in some ways. People have grown up with it and have such a sense of that universe that there's something kind of wonderful seeing everyone get involved.","Actors who perhaps are super-confident and have absolute belief in themselves I always admire, because I can't really be like that. Because you never know what's right: what you feel inside versus what is portrayed.","What is important is for me to do my best work on camera. The camera is inches away from you and sees every micromovement of every muscle of your eye. And if you're not relaxed, the camera sees it.","As someone who gets nervous in silences, I spill words rather than really think.","If you are playing someone living, it is a different type of judgment. However much work you do, it is not a documentary. There will be things you can't get right, and ultimately, you have to take a leap because - you weren't there.","The problem with motor neurone disease is they don't know when it starts. People go into hospital having fallen but get wrapped up and sent away, unless they're seen by an incredibly astute doctor. It is only when several things begin to go wrong that it'll be diagnosed.","I've worked with some actors who have such thick skins and think they are so extraordinary. I'll think, 'Have you stopped learning?' They stop listening to directors or other actors and do the same thing again and again.","A movie star is someone who has to open a film to gazillions of dollars. I'm just trying to pay my mortgage.","The thing about motor neuron disease, once a muscle stops working, it doesn't start again.","That's a lovely starting point for me as an actor: the question of what will we - or can we - do with this lot of years with which we're blessed? More than my other films, 'The Danish Girl' is about the gigantic risks involved in being true to one's self.","I hope, then, that every one who sees 'The Danish Girl' might be galvanized themselves to lead more authentic lives. How much lovelier would the world be then?","It feels like a simple human right to be able to be yourself, and yet, what trans people have to go through in order to get to there, it can be so complicated.","When I read 'Fantastic Beasts,' the world that J. K. Rowling has created is so wonderful.","When you start out acting, you dream of getting an agent and getting a job. For years, you audition and you get what you can. Choice isn't something that you have much of.","My favorite film is probably the finale - 'Deathly Hallows: Part 2'.","I'm one of those people, when I see a film, I believe it to be true. You know, sort of the authenticity of the camera and seeing things on a screen.","Our dream as actors is to tell interesting stories about interesting people.","My dad works in finance, so he kept giving me the stats: only one in a hundred actors makes it. He'd ask, 'Have you thought about producing?'","I draw and play the piano badly. But when I'm doing those things, I'm concentrating so hard there's no room for worry. I find that onstage, too.","What I love about acting is trying things and screwing up, then trying again, all in this protected little bubble. That's living the dream.","There's always been a relationship between the film world and fashion.","I'll always find the things that make a role complicated!","'Animal Ark', was when I was fourteen years old, and it was an ITV children's program, and I did an episode called, 'Bunnies in the Bathroom.' And I'm not sure if it was my finest hour.","In England, we have this saying about Marmite: people either love it or hate it. That's like a lot of the movie work I've done. People either find it repulsive or find it really interesting and get engaged in it."],"Eddie Rickenbacker":["Aviation is proof that given, the will, we have the capacity to achieve the impossible.","When I look up and see the sun shining on the patch of white clouds up in the blue, I begin to think how it would feel to be up somewhere above it winging swiftly thought the clear air, watching the earth below, and the men on it, no bigger than ants.","There is a peculiar gratification in receiving congratulations from one's squadron for a victory in the air. It is worth more to a pilot than the applause of the whole outside world.","I can give you a six-word formula for success: Think things through - then follow through.","Courage is doing what you are afraid to do. There can be no courage unless you are scared.","The excitement of automobile racing did not compare with what I knew must come with aeroplane fighting in France.","The obviously inexperienced pilot is the game the scientific air-fighter goes after, and the majority of victories are won that way. But, on the other hand, it is the novice usually who gets the famous ace by doing at some moment the unexpected thing.","When I was racing, I had learned that you can't set stock in public adoration or your press clippings. By the time I was 26, I'd heard crowds of 100,000 scream my name, but a week later they couldn't remember who I was. You're a hero today and a bum tomorrow - hero to zero, I sometimes say.","I shall never ask any pilot to go on a mission that I won't go on.","I would rather have a million friends than a million dollars.","The four cornerstones of character on which the structure of this nation was built are: Initiative, Imagination, Individuality and Independence.","It is the easiest thing in the world to die. The hardest is to live.","The experienced fighting pilot does not take unnecessary risks. His business is to shoot down enemy planes, not to get shot down.","I'll fight like a wildcat until they nail the lid of my pine box down on me.","Flying is one of the safest jobs in the Army as long as you don't drop out. If you do drop out, you are a dead man, and dropping out means, usually, that you have made a mistake or let go of your grip.","Long practise in driving a racing car at a hundred miles an hour or so gives first-class training in control and judging distances at high speed and helps tremendously in getting motor sense, which is rather the feel of your engine than the sound of it, a thing you get through your bones and nerves rather than simply your ears.","Fighting in the air is not a sport. It is scientific murder.","Never count on the crowd to take care of you.","I am not a labor hater.","Some friends are better shots than are casual enemies.","Sports of every sort had always appealed to me.","The sensation of dying is sweet, sensuous, placid.","I've cheated the Grim Reaper more times than anyone I know."],"Eddie Slovik":["Honest honey, I feel like crying every time I sit down to write you a letter... I am so unlucky.","Army life don't agree with me.","Everything happens to me. I've never had a streak of luck in my life.","I am in the infantry for 17 weeks and after that I don't know where I am going.","I think I'm going to have a lot of trouble.","I'm sorry I didn't go to jail for six months, then I know you could come to see me anytime you wanted to.","I've made up my mind. I'll take my court martial.","The only luck I had in my life was when I married you. I knew it wouldn't last because I was too happy. I knew they would not let me be happy.","They're not shooting me for deserting the United Stated Army - thousands of guys have done that. They're shooting me for bread I stole when I was 12 years old."],"Eddie Trunk":["The biggest compliments I've heard about 'That Metal Show' are the ones from people that say that they don't even listen to this kind of music, but, 'We love watching the show.'","Hard rock for me is AC/DC, Def Leppard, Tesla, Kiss. Metal tends to be louder, ruder, darker, like Judas Priest, Slayer, Iron Maiden.","My interviewing style and my approach to things is that, yes, it's okay to be sincere; it's okay to be yourself; it's okay to be real.","The power chords in 'Come Sail Away' were super heavy to me as a kid. Metal? No. Hard rock? At times, for sure.","I've known Bret Michaels forever.","People sometimes tell me that I don't talk or act or look like a metal fan. Well, what does a metal fan look like? I've found people from all walks of life who love metal.","One of the things I've done on my shows is tell stories and do interviews.","It's hard for people to realize now, but my gosh, when I was in school, you could not name a group that was less cool than Kiss. Going in to school with a Kiss T-shirt, you were asking for ridicule. In '77, they were one of the biggest bands in the world, but by '80, there was a severe backlash.","Jon Bon Jovi is remarkable.","I have never said anything critical about Ozzy that he didn't say about himself many times.","When I was a kid just starting out on the radio, I would always watch people. And I'd see the interest they'd have in trying to get a photo with an artist or get a ticket stub signed. I guess, to me, that's the ultimate thing - to know that what you've done is important enough to other people that they want to take a picture with you.","I am so appreciative of all the attention I've gotten, especially since I don't ever consider myself anything more than a fan.","I'm completely open about the fact that I don't love every genre of metal. I like what I like. It's got to have some vocal quality and some semblance of melody.","My books are personal: I'm not saying they're the Bible of music.","I want to be the Letterman of metal. I want five nights a week, Monday to Friday, 11 to 12, live. I always shoot for the moon.","I've had the privilege of meeting and/or interviewing most of the top metal and hard rock artists at various points in my career and sharing their stories and music with millions of fans on air through TV and radio.","I still love radio, but TV is also an awesome platform.","I wasn't a good student in high school. I mean, I got through it, but unless it had something to do with music, it didn't really interest me.","I wrote the music column in my high school newspaper.","One thing people would be surprised about is that although hard rock and heavy metal are without question 90% of what I listen to and my passion, there are other things I enjoy. My first ever favorite band in my life before KISS was a power-pop band called The Raspberries.","How do you possibly say that a cover band is better than the band that created and wrote the material? It's absurd.","People tell me all the time I should stop and smell the roses, but I can't. I'm always thinking of what I can do to make what I have better and do more.","VH1 Classic is the destination for people who would be interested in a music talk show.","In a way, Jersey really supports rock, maybe more than New York City and Long Island. I know plenty of bands that tour and do much better at Starland or other clubs in New Jersey than others in the tri-state area.","Skid Row would probably be my favorite Jersey band.","Black Sabbath invented heavy metal, in my opinion.","Anytime rock and metal can get on mainstream TV at all, it's a good thing.","Metal never goes away. It drifts in and out, but the true fans are always there for it.","If you're not in a major city, many bands don't come your way, and you have to really travel to see them.","Metal has always been somewhat marginalized, and I love to prove the perception and stereotypes that go with it wrong.","Guys like Howard Stern, Bill O'Reilly, Jim Rome, Bill Maher, those are the guys I love and respect as broadcasters.","Years ago, I carved out an identity, and it has always been about having a voice to tell people about stuff I love.","Jersey gets a bad rap. Most people make an assessment of this state on the ride from Newark Airport into Manhattan.","I've got to say, my parents have always been very supportive. I used to sit in my bedroom and read every liner note and listened to records. My parents are rock fans.","I've been urged by people forever to try and start a real Rock Hall of Fame. I've had some very, very preliminary discussions about doing it. Obviously, I can't do it myself, but there are a lot of people interested in that.","I have literally been working in music just about my entire life.","The one thing that's changed for 'That Metal Show' is that it's now global; it's now on in places outside of America.","One thing I've learned, and I don't really blame anybody for this: most people who have a lot of money are the people that want to make money more than anyone. I've seen it with athletes, I've seen it with musicians, you know?","The only time people get pressured into doing reunions to make more money is when the current lineup is underperforming. And by bringing back the other guy, it increases their draw.","My father will go see Trans-Siberian Orchestra every single year. I mean, he's completely into it.","I'm a pretty big news junkie.","To have survived in radio for 30 years is pretty remarkable. Even more remarkable is to have been able to do it in the same market I've lived in my whole life.","I truly believe that you have to bring more content to the table to survive in radio than saying, 'There was AC/DC, and here's Journey,' because computers can do that.","When I do interviews, I never pre-plan them at all, radio or TV.","I think that, for me, the great books like that, autobiographies, are great when the artists who write them throw caution to the wind and really put it out there as they saw it.","I've always supported new music from classic bands, especially if it's good.","I still love physical product. I still hold out for actual CDs, because in radio, everyone just wants to send you a file to play.","I have an iPod, but I put my music in it from my CDs, and then I have that CD in my library."],"Eddie Van Halen":["I'm not a rock star. Sure I am, to a certain extent because of the situation, but when kids ask me how it feels to be a rock star, I say leave me alone, I'm not a rock star. I'm not in it for the fame, I'm in it because I like to play.","There are really three parts to the creative process. First there is inspiration, then there is the execution, and finally there is the release.","It's funny, when bands or younger musicians ask me: 'So, what does it take to make it?' Well, first explain to me what you mean by 'making it': Do you want to be a rock star or do you want music to be your livelihood?","We're musicians. We make music for a living. It's that simple. Nothing else matters.","A guitar is a very personal extension of the person playing it. You have to be emotionally and spiritually connected to your instrument. I'm very brutal on my instruments, but not all the time.","It's all about sound. It's that simple.","Before the operation on my left hand I wasn't able to stretch my fingers open all the way. I've never had very big hands, but I could do the splits with them. Eventually I couldn't any more. I had a twisted tendon in my little finger that prevented me from being able to stretch.","On 'Honeybabysweetiedoll' I used a Whammy, a Boss OC-3 octave box, a Sustainer and a Line 6 DL4 Delay Modeler. That's only on the intro, where all those weird noises are happening.","When I was growing up and listening to bands like the Dave Clark Five, the groove was what initially got me going. I really like that funky, heavy groove.","I've had a hip replacement, I've beaten cancer, I had my hand operation, and I stopped drinking. Something inside of me just went, 'I'm done.'","If you want to be a rock star or just be famous, then run down the street naked, you'll make the news or something. But if you want music to be your livelihood, then play, play, play and play! And eventually you'll get to where you want to be.","I have pictures of me sitting in the racquetball court in my pajamas with an acoustic guitar, and Wolfgang is probably just two-and-a-half-feet tall. I'll never forget the day I saw his foot tapping along in beat! I knew then, I couldn't wait for the day I'd be able to make music with my son. I don't know what more I could ask for.","It's always a Catch-22 situation. They hate you if you're the same, and they hate you if you're different.","It's always about the music, never about anything else.","If I can help a kid discover a liking, or even a passion for music in their life, then that's a wonderful thing.","Nirvana was huge, but it didn't appeal to everyone.","There's a plaque on our wall that says we've sold over 65 million albums, and I don't feel I've accomplished anything. I feel like I'm just getting started.","Every song is like a kid. How can you have that many kids and have a favorite? Which one do I like to hang most with?","Cancer is like a cockroach. It just comes back stronger. I'm tearing apart the immune system of the cockroach and seeing how it ticks. I've opened up my own pathology center.","I was trying to take the band in a direction that I thought was appropriate, and Roth was trying to take the band in more of a Las Vegas direction. And there he is.","I'm not a drunk anymore, but since they cut out my tongue, I sound drunk.","When Van Halen started out, there was no path to fame. We just played what we liked. Even today it always comes down to the simplicity of rock and roll.","David Lee Roth had the idea that if you covered a successful song, you were half way home. C'mon - Van Halen doing 'Dancing in the Streets'? It was stupid. I started feeling like I would rather bomb playing my own songs than be successful playing someone else's music.","Music is for people. The word 'pop' is simply short for popular. It means that people like it. I'm just a normal jerk who happens to make music. As long as my brain and fingers work, I'm cool.","I'm the one in the band that said I'm not going on tour unless we do a record.","I never took guitar lessons. I took classical piano lessons from the age of six when we lived in Holland. And when we moved to America, it was just the typical thing except I was really good at it; so was my brother.","I started doing all kinds of weird stuff on the guitar, which became part of my playing. I started doing harmonics and tapping on the guitar and pulling off strings and doing all this weird stuff that no one had ever done before.","It makes me feel kind of weird, but obviously the Man Upstairs gave me something and it touches people, and I'm just so blessed.","I grew up on a lot of early Beatles, DC5, Cream, Clapton, Page, Beck and Hendrix.","Everything I did is because I wanted to do it. If I weren't playing this arena, if I were playing a club, I'd still be doing it because that's what I want to do. I love playing the guitar.","The piano is a universal instrument. If you start there, learn your theory and how to read, you can go on to any other instrument.","I have selective hearing.","I'm blessed with a good pair of ears. That's how I fooled my piano teacher. I'd watch his fingers and I'd listen to it, and I just kind of basically learned it by myself.","I can't read music. Instead, I'd do stuff inside the piano, do harmonics and all kinds of crazy things. They used to put me in these annual piano contests down at Long Beach City College, and two years in a row, I won first prize - out of like 5,000 kids! The judges were like, 'Very interesting interpretation!' I thought I was playing it right.","I'm writing, and just doing the same thing I always do.","And if I would have taken lessons I probably wouldn't have done it, and what forced me to do all this weird stuff on the guitar was I couldn't afford effects pedals, I didn't have all this stuff when I was a kid so I just tried to squeeze all the weird noises I could out of the guitar, which brings me to building guitars.","'For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge' took a year to record; that's why the playing on it might sound somewhat labored. 'Balance,' on the other hand, was written and recorded in only four months, so the whole process was quicker and more immediate.","Actually, if I could deliberately sit down and write a pop hit, all my songs would be pop hits! Let's put it this way. I play what I like to hear. And sometimes I like to hear something poppy, and sometimes I don't.","You know, most people, they want to go to Hollywood. They want to be a star. They want to be a rock star. That thought never entered any of our minds, the Van Halen family.","I mean it's funny, playing music, how of course you want it to do well, you want them to like it, but it's not competitive like an election, it's the Olympics, it's not a Formula 1 race. The Billboard charts are just to show you what people like.","Every song is like a kid. How can you have that many kids and have a favorite? Which one do I like to hang most with? Probably the one that I haven't hung most with recently.","I never dreamt of being a musician for my livelihood. I certainly never would have wanted to be in the business that I'm in, meaning the fame and the glory, the glitter, the rock star, the famous part.","We make music for a living. Like I've always said, if you like what you're doing, you're halfway there; if someone else likes it, that's even better. If they don't like it, at least you like it. Not to be selfish, but you kind of have to be.","I'll always leave the same set of strings on my guitars when I'm recording. If I break one I'll just replace it instead of putting on a whole new set of strings.","I never took guitar lessons. I took classical piano lessons from the age of six when we lived in Holland.","The only band I was really over-into was Cream. And the only thing I really liked about them was their live stuff 'cause they played two verses, then go off and jam for 20 minutes, come back and do a chorus and end. And I love the live jam stuff, the improvisation.","I don't feel a day older when it comes to my approach to music or what gets me off than when I was a teenager. I've always been into different kinds of stuff and when I play I like to play loud. I like my arm hairs to move and I like my body to vibrate 'cause I like the feel of it; I'm still a teenager at heart.","The one thing I do have is good ears. I don't mean perfect pitch, but ears for picking things up. I developed my ear through piano theory, but I never had a guitar lesson in my life, except from Eric Clapton off of records.","When I'm home on a break, I lock myself in my room and play guitar. After two or three hours, I start getting into this total meditation. It's a feeling few people experience, and that's usually when I come up with weird stuff. It just flows. I can't force myself. I don't sit down and say I've got to practice.","I destroyed a lot of guitars trying to get them to do what I wanted, but I learned something from every guitar I tore apart, and discovered even more things. Things like if the string is not straight from the bridge saddle to the nut, you're going to have friction.","If you have a great-sounding guitar that's a quality instrument and a good amp, and you know how to make the guitar talk, that's the key. It starts with the guitar and knowing what it should sound and feel like.","The stainless-steel frets were a major breakthrough, because of the amount of playing and bending that I do. I have to get my guitars refretted every couple of months.","A good producer brings out the best in the artist he's working with. You shouldn't be able to listen to something and say, 'So-and-so produced this album.'","I don't really know what inspires me to write the music I do, but usually, the music will set the tone for the lyrics.","It comes back to the same old question people are always asking me: 'When are you going to do a solo record?' Well, if I did, it would probably be similar to 'Baluchitherium,' meaning it would be Van Halen music - which I write anyway - but without singing.","On 'Van Halen,' I was a young punk, and everything revolved around the fastest kid in town, gunslinger attitude. But I'd say that at the time of 'Fair Warning,' I started concentrating more on songwriting. But I guess in most people's minds I'm just a gunslinger.","My son, Wolfgang, plays drums, guitars and bass.","The name Van Halen, the family legacy, is going to go on long after I'm gone.","I can't read music. Instead, I'd do stuff inside the piano, do harmonics and all kinds of crazy things. They used to put me in these annual piano contests down at Long Beach City College, and two years in a row, I won first prize - out of like 5,000 kids!","Imagine if Beethoven had a tape recorder. Then you'd know exactly what he meant. Maybe he meant 'Da da da da' instead of 'Boom boom boom boom!' Who knows?","I just consider myself slightly left-of-center. I'm not your average bear. I - what's the word? I'm not - normal.","Obviously you have to have rhythm. If you have rhythm, then you can play anything you need. If you have rhythm and you love music, then play and play and play until you get to where you want to get. If you can pay the rent, great. If you can't, then you'd better be having fun.","It's all about sound. It's that simple. Wireless is wireless, and it's digital. Hopefully somewhere along the line somebody will add more ones to the zeros. When digital first started, I swear I could hear the gap between the ones and the zeros.","I'll be making music 'til the day I die. I've done all kinds of stuff, and more is coming.","Music kept me off the streets and out of trouble and gave me something that was mine that no one could take away from me."],"Eddie Vedder":["The best revenge is to live on and prove yourself.","The way we're attached to our phones these days, they buzz and twitch in our pockets, and we have to look and see if it was a text, a voicemail, or an e-mail. We're almost like lab rats. I tried to eschew the whole cell phone theory until I had kids; then, I had to be reachable at all times.","Whatever your walk of life is, I think you have to be real about it.","I probably get strangers coming up to me two or three times a week to just say something nice. I get more than my share of compliments as I walk through my daily life. I'm not having to show off or make a point about how good I am at doing something. I think I've always kind of been that way.","Life moves fast. As much as you can learn from your history, you have to move forward.","I feel like we have to keep our eyes on the road. Being nostalgic is like taking an offramp and getting a sandwich - and then you get back on the highway. I don't want to be spending the rest of my life at the gas station.","It's an art to live with pain... mix the light into gray.","No matter how good you are, at some point your kids are gonna have to create their own independence and think that Mom and Dad aren't cool, just to establish themselves. That's what adolescence is about. They're gonna go through that no matter what.","People are just trying to work their jobs, raise their families, discipline their kids, and have a good life... Politics has just become like bad weather. And they deserve clear skies.","The love received is the love that is saved.","If it's a good cause, I'll play just about anything.","It's not a bad time to be me.","When it comes to grunge or even just Seattle, I think there was one band that made the definitive music of the time. It wasn't us or Nirvana, but Mudhoney. Nirvana delivered it to the world, but Mudhoney were the band of that time and sound.","You can go down the list of great artists and kind of understand that they are products of their environment. Whether it's U2 or Henry Rollins or myself or Johnny Lydon, they're gonna be products of their environment.","I had actually been going to Hawaii for quite a while before I ever picked up the uke. I think with anything new you're going to get more enjoyment out of it if it comes to you quickly, and the uke facilitates that.","I don't need drugs to make my life tragic.","People say, 'How does having kids change your writing? Do you see the world through their eyes?' No - you just become a faster songwriter... In the old days, you'd be like, 'Oh I'm gonna work on this song for a few days.'","Caffeine. The gateway drug.","It's fun singing with other people who are really good singers. There's something kind of poignant about braiding a couple vocals.","It's a character-builder to be a fan of the Chicago Cubs.","It's a crazy world, so sports and athletics and music can be a form of escapism.","I think music is the greatest art form that exists, and I think people listen to music for different reasons, and it serves different purposes. Some of it is background music, and some of it is things that might affect a person's day, if not their life, or change an attitude. The best songs are the ones that make you feel something.","I realized in the early days I just didn't edit at all. But I think you become a little more cagey with your lyrics when you know more people are going to hear them and make assumptions about you as a person. Realizing that, you want to be a little more opaque.","The fact that we're living in a country where 90 percent of the people want further gun laws - to maybe somehow put a dent in some of this insanity that's happening - and yet there's no further legislation taking place, it's very frustrating and upsetting.","Music was your real passion, this thing you held dear even above family. It was this relationship that never betrayed you. Once it became your job - this thing that was highly visible, this thing that became about commerce - that's when you were holding onto music like it was a palm tree in a hurricane.","You know, punk bands now sell with one record - their first or second record - sell 10 times the amount of records than the Ramones did throughout their career with 20-something records. That's why I go over to Johnny Ramone's house and do yard work three times a week, just to absolve some of the guilt.","I've never been a calm, midrange type person.","With about a dozen assorted ongoing conflicts in the news every day, and with the stories becoming more horrific, the level of sadness becomes unbearable. And what becomes of our planet when that sadness becomes apathy? Because we feel helpless. And we turn our heads and turn the page.","Do you force your kids to pay attention to what's going on, or do you let them live their lives outside of it? My hope is that my child is a strong activist. That would make me most proud.","If there was anything that I learned with my own writing process, maybe there's too many choices what to write about. Just the amount of subject matter in the world these days; maybe that feels chaotic for me.","You know, rock stardom... I have a hard time discussing that because I don't really accept it. It's not really that tangible. What's really bizarre is how it's used as a thing - you know, 'He's the rock star of politics,' 'He's the rock star of quarterbacks' - like it's the greatest thing in the world.","I think that if your approach is one where you don't want to alienate anybody, you're going to have to soften the viewpoint or the information that you're offering to such an extent that it doesn't have the power to make any difference. You have to take that risk.","The interesting thing is that it seems like George W. Bush would have been happy being the president of anything. He could have been president of Major League Baseball.","If at noon you sit down and there's just silence or blank tape, in an hour if you have a song, that didn't exist an hour ago. Now it exists and it might exist for a long time. There's something empowering about that.","I just have this deep kind of connection to reality of being like... in a way, I feel like a dock worker. I want to stay in connection with my dock-worker side, 'cause that's how I grew up.","Sometimes, whether you like it or not, people elevate you. It's real easy to fall.","Our influences are who we are. It's rare that anything is an absolutely pure vision; even Daniel Johnston sounds like the Beatles. And that's the problem with the bands I'm always asked about, the ones derivative of the early Seattle sound. They don't dilute their influences enough.","I just think that all of us in this room should have a voice in how the USA is represented. And he don't allow us our voice, that's all I'm saying.","I think celebrities suck.","When I had a child, everyone was telling me that I was going to see the world through her eyes, and everything was going to get this nice gloss to it. I kept waiting for that to happen, and thought there was a real problem with me that it wasn't.","At a certain point, you realize you have a responsibility more behind yourself and your need for adrenaline. I'm glad I did things in my 20s that were more reckless.","I'm trying to break any chain of negative parenting that I might have survived.","I'm an example of someone who never made it to university. I did have this dream to be a musician. I felt that this dream had an expiration date.","As far as viewpoints, I think I'm more well-rounded and definitely more educated, and probably more hopeful than I used to be. I think when you're young and you get into a cause, you get frustrated with it within a few years, or six months.","I just finished touring, and I'm on a detox thing. It's a heavy detox, so nothing in my belly except water, salt, and cayenne pepper.","You can't be perfect. You can't be the perfect father. You can't be the perfect singer.","There's been times when I've been standing in a line at a movie and someone's hit me with something really heavy about someone really close and how our music has helped them get through it. Even in our darkest moments we try and find something beautiful.","Any conversations we hear about 'So who are Pearl Jam marketing to?' are despicable.","I think the hardest thing about making music now is being a great dad at the same time. There's an insanity that goes with writing - a mad scientist thing that you have to go through - and sacrificing a kid's upbringing to do that is not an option.","There's a lot of bands that get to a certain level, and it just stops. They scrap it. Compare this to, say, The Rolling Stones or The Who, where they just continued on forever and are still playing, or they quit after 20 years.","If I'm not on tour or in the studio, I'm in nature somewhere, usually some kind of ocean. Playing music has afforded me that. It's not lost on me that it's a tremendous opportunity to be able to spend your life being surrounded by nature.","So my one kid's 4, my other kid's 4 months, I'm 44, Barack Obama is the 44th president - it's all lining up nicely here.","Playing music for as long as I had been playing music and then getting a shot at making a record and at having an audience and stuff, it's just like an untamed force... a different kind of energy.","I'm not ready to be that guy who can meet with world leaders and all that. It's tremendous what Bono does. I don't know if I could do it, not the way he does. I don't think many people could.","That's part of the curse: If you're gonna play the song, you better play it. I've tried to phone in 'Jeremy' a few times, and it's tough. It doesn't work.","I was living on the wrong side of the tracks in Evanston, Illinois, in a home for boys. We had these Jackson 5 records. I really related to their voices - they were about my age, but they were doing it.","When I was 13, I got my first guitar, and I could sort of play Ted Nugent songs, but I couldn't play the solos. But I could play along with entire Ramones songs.","After the Ramones, it was more about new wave for me than punk.","I am not a good enough writer to have an agenda or come up with a message and try to put it into a song. It's more like you write what comes to you... You try to reflect the mood of the songs.","The one thing about going from the audience to the stage in just three years is that you know how it feels to be down there.","We went from an era when rock 'n' roll meant wearing a bustier as a woman and these spandex things and guys trying to portray someone that wasn't realistic. We are trying to make it seem real... relate to our lives.","Pretty much at all times music motivates me. How can I say this without sounding in any way proud of myself? Obviously I've always written songs that are critical of our government, and talk about our times. Hopefully you attempt to be timeless while doing it.","I'd like people to be educated on the voting machines, making sure that our democracy isn't being hijacked by computer technology. There's no reason there can't be a paper trail on those machines.","People on death row, the treatment of animals, women's right to choose. So much in America is based on religious fundamentalist Christianity. Grow up! This is the modern world!","I don't know how people do it these days - paparazzi and that kind of thing. That's something I can't even imagine.","I suppose one of the challenges of writing the word-side of music these days is trying to decipher and communicate how this planet is very overwhelming at this point. The difficulties we face are overwhelming. It's very difficult to give yourself the time to breathe and appreciate the joy and beauty that might be just right around us.","There's a finite amount of time on this planet for each of us. Sometimes, the only way we figure out how to deal with that reality - knowing that there will be an end to every story, and you don't know how many chapters are left in your book - is by living in denial.","Presumptuously, I speak for all Who fans when I say being a fan of the Who has incalculably enriched my life. What disturbs me about the Who is the way they smashed through every door of rock & roll, leaving rubble and not much else for the rest of us to lay claim to.","I was around nine when a babysitter snuck 'Who's Next' onto the turntable. The parents were gone. The windows shook. The shelves were rattling. Rock & roll. That began an exploration into music that had soul, rebellion, aggression, affection.","The Who quite possibly remain the greatest live band ever. Even the list-driven punk legend and music historian Johnny Ramone agreed with me on this.","The Who on record were dynamic. Roger Daltrey's delivery allowed vulnerability without weakness; doubt and confusion, but no plea for sympathy.","When attempting to make a plea for more peace in the world at a rock concert, we are reflecting the feelings of all those we have come in contact with so we may all have a better understanding of each other."],"Eddy Arnold":["When I finally put my guitar in the case the last time, I want to be remembered just as a singer, not as a country singer or pops singer - just a singer.","Don't be afraid to fall flat on your face.","Touring is really a pretty lonely business.","This is my seventh decade... and every once in a while I get a hankering to re-visit these songs again... songs with which I have had a great relationship.","I'm trying to sell every audience something; that something is me."],"Eddy Cue":["It doesn't matter how good or bad the product is; the fact is that people don't read anymore.","Competition on anything is good, because it makes everybody better.","I think when you go to a store and you go to the Justin Timberlake page and stream it from there, that's great, but that means you went to the store. iTunes Radio lets you discover it without you having to think about it.","The quality of TV, I think, is at an all-time high. The problem with it is the way that we end up consuming it - generally a cable box. A satellite receiver is, to me, nothing more than a glorified VCR.","That's the great thing about Apple: it's very focused on the things that we know how to do very well and not try to extend ourselves to areas that we know very little about or don't have a lot of expertise in.","The fact that I have to set things to record seems idiotic. And channel guides - I get home, and I want to watch a Duke basketball game; why do I have to go hunting to find out what channel it's on? Why can't I just say, 'I want to watch Duke basketball.' Or, even better, why doesn't the system know that?","In recent years, the government has lost more than five million fingerprints from government employees. They have lost hundreds of millions of credit numbers from financial institutions. This problem is happening more and more and more. And the only way we can protect ourselves is to make phones more and more secure.","When you look at Apple News and where it started, I want it to be available to everyone. But we also want to make sure the news producers are legitimate... We're very concerned about what's news items and what's clickbait.","I've always felt that technology companies have disrespected the content creation process, and the content creation people disrespect technology.","One thing you know, if you've been in technology a while, you're only as good as the last thing you did. No one wants an original iPod. No one wants an iPhone 3GS.","My mom is from Cuba, my dad is from Spain, and I grew up in Miami. So there's maybe a little more flair in me than typical Silicon Valley types."],"Eddy Grant":["There has never been any proper commitment to marketing these artists and their music. We are not Sony.","The artists realise it will take time. It is an upliftment process.","I am outraged that the Gorillaz have infringed the copyright of my song 'Time Warp,' claiming their song 'Stylo' to be an original composition."],"Eden Ahbez":["Some white people hate black people, and some white people love black people, some black people hate white people, and some black people love white people. So you see it's not an issue of black and white, it's an issue of Lovers and Haters.","I am a being of Heaven and Earth, of thunder and lightning, of rain and wind, of the galaxies.","The earth is my altar, the sky is my dome, mind is my garden, the heart is my home and I'm always at home - yea, I'm always at Om.","We're not earthly beings any more... we're cosmic beings.","The greatest thing you'll ever learn is to love and be loved, just to love and be loved.","Now Heaven and Earth are older than the temples, and older than the Scriptures."],"Eden Hazard":["I love cooking. There is nothing I like better than going home and cooking my family a nice meal. Anything with pasta! Pasta with butter! I have a good repertoire, and I can do quite a few different dishes. Sometimes they work out and sometimes not.","My target is to give everything, and only if we win the trophies will I be relaxed.","You question yourself all the time as a footballer. You have to focus on the positives.","People will see me at Chelsea the way I am and judge me the way they want to.","That's my mentality. Just because somebody has fouled me, there is no reason for me to be nasty to him. I try to respect football as much as possible, and when someone is injured, you put the ball out.","I'd played some very good games, at Manchester United, at Tottenham Hotspur, but they'd lacked a goal. There've been times when I could have scored myself, but I've played a pass to a team-mate instead.","I'm somebody who can laugh even at myself. That happens now and again, when I've made a mess of really simple things.","I've had more ups than downs in my career. All you can do is keep working. You still have to take enjoyment out of what you're doing, and things will turn, and my smile has always been there. In good moments and bad.","The Premier League is difficult. The small teams can beat the big teams.","We don't look at records, but if we can make history in this club, we will. It's not only about Chelsea, this league.","I played without fear. I've done that since I first kicked a ball in my back garden as a five-year-old, whether it's been my first game, my 100th game, or my 500th game.","When you are young, you sometimes play one good game and then one bad game.","Why change? If you're happy, and things are going really well at one place, there is no need to change.","I am happy with my form; I just need to score a couple of goals. I want the ball. I want to create something.","I am at one of the best clubs in the world and in the best league. And in my private life, everything is also going very well. At 25, I feel in the right place.","If I ever leave, it'll be after winning a championship. You need to go out on a high so that people remember you for the right reasons.","It never became an obsession for me to score at all costs. I've always said that I'm not a big scorer, I'm a worker.","A couple of games, I played up front when Diego Costa was not there. We know to create movement - not even to get the ball, but create space for others. Now I understand football is not always with the ball at my feet.","I love to set up my teammates. I am not here to be a star, to show off. I am here to play for the others, but if I have to try and clinch a game, then I will.","You want to win the games, to win trophies.","I try to play like I did when I was a young boy playing in my garden. Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's not so good, but I try to always make sure I give my best to help the team, even if I am not having the best game myself.","I have always thought if there is a game, and there have been a lot of fouls on me, then I have been playing well for the team, so that means we're having a good match. You can win a free-kick when there's a foul, and that's a chance to score a goal.","The Belgian fans expect a lot of me in the Belgium team. It is normal - they don't forget that I cost Euros 40m. I totally understand.","We are professionals. We know when we're playing badly, so if you have a poor game, you work in training to put things right so form comes back.","I have always been small, so defenders have always been taller and tougher than me. So that's difficult for me; they foul me sometimes, but there you are - that's what the rules of the game are for.","The more you play against teams and defenders, the more you get to know them. You know if they are more nervous; you know, on the pitch, people are different. I try to adapt to their character.","I can still take the hits; it's not a problem for me. I accept the blows. I can take the punches like a boxer.","The Champions League is the one thing missing from my career. When I look at the history of the competition and the people that have taken part, the top, top players have all won it. For many, it is why they have been regarded as top players.","Any strengthening of the squad, in a League and Champions League which demands so much, is a good thing because you need many top quality players.","I like it when I am in the middle; I am closer to the ball. The manager wants me to pass, to make assists, create chances, and I do more because I think the position is more central, and I don't ask all the time for the ball at my feet.","If you told me to choose between family and football, then it is no choice. I take family, of course, like everyone. But I prefer to keep it private, and that's it. I just focus on the football.","Football is good, but family, close friends, my brothers - I have family everywhere - is the most important thing.","When the game is finished, it's completely finished. I'm with my kids. Sometimes people say to me, 'Oh, did you see the game?' and I say, 'No, I didn't see the game'. I watch if my friends are playing or my brothers. But not always.","It's true that I'm even better than I could have imagined, both in football and in my private life!","In tactics and training, we do more with Conte. We work a lot of tactical positions, and we know exactly what we have to do on the pitch, where I have to go, and where the defenders have to go. We know exactly what to do.","For me, it's easier to play with my right foot. It's simple. If I go right, I see Diego and have different solutions: I go alone or pass to Diego, or the midfield can join in. If I go the other way, the cross with my left foot is not good.","When I get the ball with my back to goal, I like to be in touching contact. I need to feel the guy. He will try to take the ball, and I will go past him.","Kante is a good player. For me, it is good because he speaks French. We know he is a fantastic player; he runs a lot and works for the team.","I played with Michy for Belgium. He is still young; he can finish and is very good. He just needs to adapt to English football, and he will. He is intelligent and a good player.","I knew that Chelsea was a club that changed its manager reasonably often.","Out of all the clubs who were interested, I got the feeling that, deep down, Chelsea showed that they really wanted me. There were lots of reasons I came to Chelsea. They showed a real desire to get me to come here. I didn't have to think about it too much.","I always liked No. 10 because I loved Zidane. He was my role model. I always wanted to play like him.","I want to work with the best coaches in the world.","It is hard to say no to PSG - as with all teams capable of winning the Champions League, There is always uncertainty in football.","I ask myself what I can do to become like Messi and Ronaldo and score 50 or 60 goals in a season.","I'm not in search of records like some other players. If I can score between 15 and 20 goals each season, I will be very happy.","I'm not a top-five player yet. Maybe I'm close to it, but I still have to work on some aspects. You can only be part of that group if you are decisive in the top games.","Jose Mourinho and I get along well. I've lots of respect for him. He gives me a lot of confidence. After a bad game, he dares to say, 'We have played with 10 today,' but that's it. At moments like that, he leaves me alone.","I've always been clear - I feel good at Chelsea. Every week, I repeat the same on PSG. It's a big team but an inferior league. I don't want to return to France, because I've won everything over there - the league title, cup, best player, best young player.","I don't want to say PSG is a step backwards, but It would be returning to something I already know. I'm always in for new challenges. When I will leave Chelsea one day, it would be to discover something new.","Deep down, I never wanted to see Mourinho fired. We experienced some very beautiful things together in 2015.","When I was back to 100 per cent fitness, I was able to show what I was capable of. I like to think I will bring a freshness into the Euros, and now that I am captain, I am going to do my best to take responsibility.","The future is always the same, and that is to win trophies - next season, in two and three years.","If my wife was to say, 'Honey, I'd like you to go to PSG', I would have to take it into account.","I don't need to speak about N'Golo; everyone knows about him. He's everywhere. I think, sometimes when I'm on the pitch, I see him twice. One on the left, one on the right. I think I'm playing with twins!","I have always been the same player, but Conte knows how to treat players, having played at the highest level himself.","You have to be ready for all the games and be at 100 per cent if you want to win in this League.","I didn't want to go to Chelsea, because I wanted to play the Champions League and they were sixth in the league.","I'm not saying I like to be kicked, but it's good for me to feel I am in the game. Definitely. A motivation.","I try to be this kind of player: the type who does something whenever he gets the ball. Sometimes in the past, I've gone through games where I've not touched the ball for 20 or 30 minutes.","With experience, you improve. I'm a better player now, more complete than I was when I was player of the year.","These days, I'm always trying to have lots of touches, to be involved, and to play my football for 90 minutes.","For a young player like me, it is good to play for a club that can get to the semi-finals because one of the reasons I play football is for these big games.","Individually, I am very happy because I can play in every game. I can be on the pitch and do what I like to do, which is play football.","I like to play as a No. 10. I think I have more freedom offensively. For Belgium, we have full backs who run hard and create a lot of space, which is good, and I like to play there.","I play on the left hand side, and I try to do the best I can.","My first trophy in France was the Young Player of the Year. I was 17. Chelsea is not just one player. It is not only me. We have signed a lot of players. Now we have some good signings like Cesc Fabregas and Diego Costa.","I know as soon as a game is finished if I have done well. I don't need people to tell me. I want to achieve perfection.","You mustn't smile when you lose. You have to be sad like other people. You have to win every game.","It is a pleasure to play under Jose Mourinho, and everything is OK. I learn every day. He is a normal coach. He speaks a lot with the players. I like it when the manager speaks a lot with you because it gives you confidence.","We feel good. We are full of confidence. We take game after game and try to win every game.","It is always good to be on the scoresheet.","For the strikers, we have more freedom, and even when we lose the ball, if we press together, we can get it back, and it is good system for Chelsea.","I spoke with Abramovich. He is very simple and loves football. We were on the same wavelength: he wants to confirm Chelsea's position at the top.","Chelsea have made a good investment for me, but I did not put any pressure on them.","I've always said I wanted to play in England. There was a struggle between Chelsea and United, but according to me, Chelsea has the best project.","At 21, Real Madrid or Barcelona would have been more difficult for me. If I play well enough at Chelsea, I could win my place in the starting team, and my priority is to play.","With Lille, we could have gone to the South of France, and people wouldn't have recognised us. But at Chelsea, the players are at another level. Everything has changed - the language, the country - but it is up to me to adapt.","It's true that Tottenham tempted me because it was a young team which was third in the league.","The directors told me they were going to recruit good players with whom I could play decent football. Marko Marin, Oscar and me, we like to have the ball at our feet. Juan Mata likes the ball; so does Ramires.","People were saying, 'He's worth £32m? He tried a back-heel and fell over!' Even I laughed. In my head, I said, 'OK, you've seen the bad side, now come see the good side'.","I watched videos of great players. I was inspired by what they did, then I used to try things out in training.","When I was small, I was the same as everyone else. I used to play in a small council estate nearby. But it's really my family who taught me. I started watching my dad play from the age of two. I wanted to be like him.","The first pitch I played on, for my first club, Braine-le-Comte, was only a metre from our house! I progressed very quickly.","Weight training and working on being explosive helped me gain a few yards of pace. Even when I was small, I was stocky. Even if people pushed me, I managed to stay on my feet.","I know how to make the difference. When I make the difference, I often do it at the end of the match, and that shows that I am fresh.","It is good, it is better to be voted by the players - they know everything about football.","Chelsea are a big club - we have to win titles and to qualify for the Champions League. There's a lot to do, but we'll try to do it all.","The FA Cup for all the fans does mean something special.","The FA Cup is something we want to win, but when you play for Chelsea, it is not something you think about a lot because you want to win every game."],"Eden Phillpotts":["The universe is full of magical things, patiently waiting for our wits to grow sharper.","The people sensible enough to give good advice are usually sensible enough to give none.","I used to hurt so badly that I'd ask God why, what have I done to deserve any of this? I feel now He was preparing me for this, for the future. That's the way I see it.","You never know what a fool you can be till life gives you the chance.","If you go on working with the light available, you will meet your Master, as he himself will be seeking you.","We always think every other man's job is easier than our own. The better he does it, the easier it looks.","I had no ambition to make a fortune. Mere money-making has never been my goal, I had an ambition to build."],"Eden Riegel":["'Cooking Lucky' is a show for guys - or girls - or really for anyone who is all thumbs in the kitchen and needs some help cooking meals that are so incredibly impressive they make it look like you've been slaving in the kitchen all day when in reality, they are so effortless to put together that even a moron can do it.","I met my husband through a mutual friend. He invited me over for dinner and cooked this meal that knocked my socks off - and maybe knocked off a few other pieces of clothing off as well.","One of the first major storylines that 'All My Children' featured was Erica Kane, a rebellious daughter, and her mother, sort of a matriarchal type, who was trying to guide her daughter to a safer place."],"Eden Robinson":["The Haisla named this point Obela. Not so long ago, the bay was lined with longhouses and canoes, totem poles and fishing gear. The reserve was once a winter village, a place to celebrate the sacred season, when memories passed in dance and song and stories from one generation to the next with great feasts called potlatches.","While hereditary chiefs inhabit the apex of our traditional social systems, it would be a mistake to think they hold all the power. They aren't kings. They aren't dictators. They're answerable to their clans and their matriarchs. All decisions that affect our communities require lengthy, deliberate discussions and careful negotiation.","In a pine tree behind me, an eagle waits out the rain, hunched into himself, brooding. Crows squabble, a murder chasing a raven. Seals cruise the lines of fishing nets bobbing in the water, hoping for an easy meal, the tender bellies of salmon.","I'm a novelist from the Haisla and Heiltsuk First Nations of British Columbia, both small coastal reserves hugging the rugged shores of the west coast.","A potlatch is similar to a court case in that both are prohibitively expensive; both involve lengthy speeches and the vigorous examination and debate of the actions, rights and legal responsibilities of the participants. One has food, singing and spiritual rites; the other, not so much.","The First Nations Financial Transparency Act insulted the integrity of the very people in our communities who guide our economic policy and act as our mediators with provincial and federal governments.","The land and the ocean are living, breathing entities that supported us, clothed us, fed us, and nurtured our culture from time immemorial.","Where I come from, people will spit at you if they think you support Enbridge.","Initial excitement over the announcement that Enbridge was building a pipeline to Kitimat dampened considerably when people discovered that the number of permanent jobs for locals, in the end, would amount to some dock workers.","The main reserve of the Haisla Nation hugs the northwest coast of British Columbia, about 500 miles north of Vancouver. The government docks sprawl on the south end of the reserve, nestled in a bay. As children, we swam at the docks and ran to the nearby point to pick blueberries and huckleberries when we were hungry so we wouldn't have to go home.","On June 22, 1793, Vancouver's Discovery and Chatham anchored in Klekane Inlet. Archibald Menzies, the ship's botanist, wrote that on the evening of June 28, they were visited by eight natives in two canoes who brought them two large salmon. This is the first known published encounter with the Haisla people."],"Eden Sher":["I don't realize how rare it is to genuinely have sincere love for everyone you work with. Especially in Hollywood, but even in life.","I have some sarcastic sides of me.","The hair department is always on my case about washing my hair. I am incredibly lazy, and a brat about washing my hair.","I live in a constant state of hyperbole.","I mostly like to travel and volunteer because I get antsy if I stay in my comfort zone for too long.","I would love to be able to see as much of the world as possible, and volunteering, doing things in another community, living with a host family, are really effective ways to learn about cultures different from your own. And also to not feel lazy.","I am the middle child with an older and younger brother.","I went to public school my whole life. It was a performing arts school, so I can't say if it was a typical experience or not, because it's all I know.","I remember the general anxiety of teenager, and I remember establishing some sort of appearance based on what my peers would think. And cliques, oh my God, the worst. The worst!","I never want to sound preachy about youth and feminism, but I feel like there aren't enough young people coming out about their concerns and opinions.","I feel very strongly that young women have regressed a little bit. But I do get all preachy about it.","On Christmas, my family and I see a movie and go out for Chinese food. We don't celebrate Christmas in the traditional sense, in that we do not actually celebrate Christmas.","I love the holidays on 'The Middle' because I feel like I'm getting that very traditional American holiday experience that I never had growing up.","Someone was asking me what my favorite outfit is, and 100%, without a doubt in my mind, is my forever lazy.","I love oral hygiene.","I went to a Katy Perry concert, and I experienced pure bliss for the first time in my life.","I have had just an excess of energy. That's why I've always been active."],"Edgar Allan Poe":["Words have no power to impress the mind without the exquisite horror of their reality.","Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there, wondering, fearing, doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before.","All that we see or seem is but a dream within a dream.","They who dream by day are cognizant of many things which escape those who dream only by night.","All religion, my friend, is simply evolved out of fraud, fear, greed, imagination, and poetry.","I became insane, with long intervals of horrible sanity.","I would define, in brief, the poetry of words as the rhythmical creation of Beauty.","Stupidity is a talent for misconception.","With me poetry has not been a purpose, but a passion.","I have great faith in fools; self-confidence my friends call it.","Science has not yet taught us if madness is or is not the sublimity of the intelligence.","We loved with a love that was more than love.","The boundaries which divide Life from Death are at best shadowy and vague. Who shall say where the one ends, and where the other begins?","I wish I could write as mysterious as a cat.","The true genius shudders at incompleteness - and usually prefers silence to saying something which is not everything it should be.","Beauty of whatever kind, in its supreme development, invariably excites the sensitive soul to tears.","Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered weak and weary.","The death of a beautiful woman, is unquestionably the most poetical topic in the world.","That pleasure which is at once the most pure, the most elevating and the most intense, is derived, I maintain, from the contemplation of the beautiful.","Of puns it has been said that those who most dislike them are those who are least able to utter them.","Experience has shown, and a true philosophy will always show, that a vast, perhaps the larger portion of the truth arises from the seemingly irrelevant.","I am above the weakness of seeking to establish a sequence of cause and effect, between the disaster and the atrocity.","If you wish to forget anything on the spot, make a note that this thing is to be remembered.","Lord, help my poor soul.","Were I called on to define, very briefly, the term Art, I should call it 'the reproduction of what the Senses perceive in Nature through the veil of the soul.' The mere imitation, however accurate, of what is in Nature, entitles no man to the sacred name of 'Artist.'","There is something in the unselfish and self-sacrificing love of a brute, which goes directly to the heart of him who has had frequent occasion to test the paltry friendship and gossamer fidelity of mere Man.","It is by no means an irrational fancy that, in a future existence, we shall look upon what we think our present existence, as a dream.","That man is not truly brave who is afraid either to seem or to be, when it suits him, a coward.","The nose of a mob is its imagination. By this, at any time, it can be quietly led.","The generous Critic fann'd the Poet's fire, And taught the world with reason to admire.","I have no faith in human perfectability. I think that human exertion will have no appreciable effect upon humanity. Man is now only more active - not more happy - nor more wise, than he was 6000 years ago.","To vilify a great man is the readiest way in which a little man can himself attain greatness.","The ninety and nine are with dreams, content but the hope of the world made new, is the hundredth man who is grimly bent on making those dreams come true.","I have, indeed, no abhorrence of danger, except in its absolute effect - in terror.","Man's real life is happy, chiefly because he is ever expecting that it soon will be so.","A strong argument for the religion of Christ is this - that offences against Charity are about the only ones which men on their death-beds can be made - not to understand - but to feel - as crime.","It is the nature of truth in general, as of some ores in particular, to be richest when most superficial.","In one case out of a hundred a point is excessively discussed because it is obscure; in the ninety-nine remaining it is obscure because it is excessively discussed.","There are few cases in which mere popularity should be considered a proper test of merit; but the case of song-writing is, I think, one of the few.","In criticism I will be bold, and as sternly, absolutely just with friend and foe. From this purpose nothing shall turn me.","I need scarcely observe that a poem deserves its title only inasmuch as it excites, by elevating the soul. The value of the poem is in the ratio of this elevating excitement.","It will be found, in fact, that the ingenious are always fanciful, and the truly imaginative never otherwise than analytic.","The rudiment of verse may, possibly, be found in the spondee."],"Edgar Bergen":["Well, a friend in need is a friend indeed.","You find out your mistakes from an audience that pays admission.","Show me where Stalin is buried and I'll show you a Communist Plot.","After 13 years of life on the half shell in Hollywood, I have made a trip where I wasn't a tourist.","So many people are working in vaudeville today that I looked for three weeks to book enough acts for an hour bill and didn't have them until the night before we opened in Buffalo and money was no object!","Nobody seems to know yet how television is going to affect the radio, movies, love, housekeeping or the church, but it has definitely revived vaudeville.","Hey kid, do you want to come and talk to Charlie?","But Charlie, Charlie, how can we ever really know anything? Charlie, what or who is God?","I was asking Charlie the most important questions, and you heard the answers.","OK, magic boy, let's see who you really are.","I've never told you the story of Alice in Wonderland, have I?"],"Edgar Bronfman, Jr.":["The history of the music industry is inevitably also the story of the development of technology. From the player piano to the vinyl disc, from reel-to-reel tape to the cassette, from the CD to the digital download, these formats and devices changed not only the way music was consumed, but the very way artists created it.","By packaging a full album into a bundle of music with ringtones, videos and other combinations and variations, we found products that consumers demonstrably valued and were willing to purchase at premium prices. And guess what? We've sold tons of them.","We must restrict the anonymity behind which people hide to commit crimes. As citizens, we have a right to privacy. We have no such right to anonymity.","It strikes me as hubris that Universal will buy EMI. What it will do is create a super-major that will have far too much power... I think when Universal goes up over 40 percent market share, I don't see how reasonable regulators can countenance. It will impact not just labels, but artists and cultural diversity.","Commercial success still hasn't come to an artist that isn't signed to a record label. There are very few artists that can succeed without the help of a record label. The role of the record label is still required, it's still necessary.","The iPod made music mobile, but today, how many devices do you need to walk around with? You want it on just one. And inevitably that's going to be the phone.","Any time you can give consumers more of what they want, it's a good thing. Unbundling the album is a good thing. In the case of music - because it is content that you can slice into songs - doing that is of huge benefit to consumers.","It's interesting that the book publishing industry, on the iPad, has much more flexibility than the music industry had.","You need to look no further than Apple's iPhone to see how fast brilliantly written software presented on a beautifully designed device with a spectacular user interface will throw all the accepted notions about pricing, billing platforms and brand loyalty right out the window.","I made the decision when I came to Seagram that it had to be OK that my public persona would be bad. It's the downside of a family business: anything good is because I'm somebody's son; otherwise, I'm a schmuck.","As my other obligations are beginning to take an inordinate amount of time, I have asked to step down as WMG's board chairman, effective January 31, 2012. However, I will remain a director of the company and in that way, continue my association with Warner Music and its extraordinary people.","Frankly, right is right and wrong is wrong, particularly when a parent is talking to a child. A bright line around moral responsibility is very important.","And since discriminating fans can pick and choose exactly what they want to buy, artists and their labels are more conscious than they've ever been of making sure that every song on a new album is as good as can be.","If you look at the market cap increase in Apple since it created the iPod versus what's happened to the music industry, you have to say Apple got the better part of that deal.","Any time that you can give the consumer more of what they want, it's a good thing. I said from Day 1 that the unbundling of the album is a good thing."],"Edgar Bronfman, Sr.":["The beauty of Judaism is that it demands we ask questions, especially of ourselves.","A peaceful resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict will likely depend to a great extent on the economic development of a future Palestinian state. As I have argued before, private sector investment - especially in the West Bank - is going to prove crucial in creating the right political and social context for peace.","Making money is marvelous, and I love doing it, and I do it reasonably well, but it doesn't have the gripping vitality that you have when you deal with the happiness of human life and with human deprivation.","Researchers consistently find that most older volunteers, when compared to older nonvolunteers, have fewer functional and physical impairments, overall better health, higher life satisfaction and less depression. In addition, they attend religious services more frequently and belong to more social organizations.","The Jews' fear of assimilation and intermarriage should not replace fear of anti-Semitism.","I remind everybody that the Sabbath was the Jewish gift to civilization.","A two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and a region free of Iranian nukes are worthy goals that should be able to withstand public scrutiny in every Middle Eastern capital.","With the common Iranian threat bringing the Sunni Arab world and Israel closer together, an Israeli-Palestinian peace would go a long way in improving relations and rebuffing Iran's regional ambitions.","I don't believe in God. I do believe in Judaism. I believe in ethics, morals.","My childhood was marked by a tension between privilege on the one hand and emotional dysfunction on the other.","No one said anything to my face, but I constantly heard comments denigrating Jews.","I would like every Jew to be as comfortable in his skin as I am in mine.","In terms of defending Jews, I'm a Jew.","Intermarriage is not a calamity but an opportunity for both a Jewish and non-Jewish partner to learn.","I've had three wives. I've had five weddings.","I'd vote for Mickey Mouse before I voted for John McCain and Sarah Palin.","My father put it right when he said: 'I don't get ulcers. I give ulcers.'","As an American Jew who loves Israel, I cannot support John McCain. He cannot provide what Israel needs most - a respected, credible, morally strong America.","The most vexing problem Israel faces is its relations with its neighbors. From the inception of the state until today, Israelis have felt besieged, surrounded by enemies who want to make them disappear.","Israel desperately needs peace if it is to come anywhere close to being the 'light unto nations' of Jewish dreams.","John McCain's choice of Sarah Palin as running mate is the towering example of his poor judgment. Palin's ignorance of public affairs is monumental.","Maintaining control indefinitely over millions of Palestinians will inevitably lead to a demographic nightmare and cannot be sustained if Israel is to remain true to its founding principles.","The majesty of the American Jewish experience is in its success marrying its unique Jewish identity with the larger, liberal values of the United States. There is no need anymore to choose between assimilation and separation. We are accepted as equals.","Just as we send young American Jews to Israel through the Birthright program, we need to also consider a 'reverse Birthright' for Israeli kids to come see America.","In the modern era, Jewish sovereignty over the land of our ancestors is a relatively short phenomenon. From the time of the successful Maccabean revolt to the Roman annexation in 63 BC constitutes about 100 years of Jewish rule. Combined with Israel's independence in 1948, this is about 160 years of effective sovereignty.","Jewish sovereignty and governance over our ancestral home are, I believe, important goals that every Jew ought to support.","The principles governing Western democracies, of which Israel rightly considers itself a part, are based on the assurance that everyone has a vote, but also that the minority needs to yield to the wishes of the majority.","There are no easy solutions for Israel's own governance problems.","Economic support from the rest of the Arab states to the fledgling Palestinian Authority in the West Bank is virtually non-existent.","There are signs that the Arab states are beginning to realize that a nuclear-armed Iran would be a threat to the entire region, and not just to Israel.","It is high time that the Arab world's professed desire for peace is matched by responsible action, and not more of the same equivocation.","Contrary to many of the rumors and innuendo in circulation, I wholeheartedly believe that Obama views Israel's security as absolute.","George W. Bush is long gone, and with him the idea that 'Israel can do no wrong.'","The Palestinian economy is, and will likely continue to be, highly reliant on trade. And yet, trade between the Palestinian Authority and the Arab states is extremely limited.","Agribusiness could provide an opportunity for joint Israeli-Palestinian projects, spurred on by Israeli technical expertise in this field.","In politics, as in business, leadership is crucial.","Much of what has gone wrong in the pursuit of Arab-Israeli peace is due to a lack of strong leadership, primarily among the Palestinians.","Based on the Gaza precedent, Israel should not simply be expected to withdraw from territory and let it devolve into a state of anarchy. The West Bank is simply too close to Israel's major population centers and infrastructure to allow it to become another launching pad for rockets.","Arab youth are taught to wonder, 'Since the Holocaust was a European affair, why are the Palestinians being forced to pay for the creation of Israel?'","The search for a Jewish national home came about due to centuries of anti-Semitic pogroms, expulsions, discrimination and hate. The Holocaust was simply the evil culmination of all that came before it.","The Arab world needs to appreciate that legitimate historical claims and modern necessities are what make Israel the homeland of the Jewish people.","If Catholics and Jews can today come together regularly for talks after so many tears and so much blood have been shed, than Jews and Arabs must be able to do the same.","Investments are a real partnership, with an expected return; donations are a gesture made as a result of ethical, religious, or political passions.","For decades, the plight of the Palestinian people has been exacerbated by internal corruption, a lack of effective investment, and the political cynicism of the Arab states, who often did not have the best interests of the Palestinians at heart.","A lasting two-state solution requires two credible partners, and not just one side - Israel - taking superficial steps simply to placate world opinion.","As a liberal and progressive, I abhor the notion of conflict and bloodshed and very much want to find a diplomatic solution to the Iran nuclear issue.","During my many years in international business and public life, I have had the good fortune of sitting down for lunch with people with whom I completely disagreed, in practice and principle: Soviet communists, heads of state from various unsavory regimes, benighted religious figures, corrupt business leaders."],"Edgar Cayce":["There is progress whether ye are going forward or backward! The thing is to move!","Dreams are today's answers to tomorrow's questions.","When ye are prepared for a thing, the opportunity to use it presents itself.","For, he that expects nothing shall not be disappointed, but he that expects much - if he lives and uses that in hand day by day - shall be full to running over.","It is thought and feeling which guides the universe, not deeds.","You can never lose anything that really belongs to you, and you can't keep that which belongs to someone else."],"Edgar Degas":["Art is not what you see, but what you make others see.","Painting is easy when you don't know how, but very difficult when you do.","What a delightful thing is the conversation of specialists! One understands absolutely nothing and it's charming.","It is all very well to copy what one sees, but it is far better to draw what one now only sees in one's memory. That is a transformation in which imagination collaborates with memory.","Only when he no longer knows what he is doing does the painter do good things.","One must do the same subject over again ten times, a hundred times. In art nothing must resemble an accident, not even movement.","No art is less spontaneous than mine. What I do is the result of reflection and the study of the great masters.","Everyone has talent at twenty-five. The difficulty is to have it at fifty.","In painting you must give the idea of the true by means of the false."],"Edgar Fiedler":["Ask five economists and you'll get five different answers - six if one went to Harvard.","For economist the real world is often a special case.","If you have to forecast, forecast often.","He who lives by the crystal ball soon learns to eat ground glass.","The herd instinct among forecasters makes sheep look like independent thinkers."],"Edgar Guest":["I want to be able, as days go by, always to look myself straight in the eye.","I take the family shopping round. The markets of the world."],"Edgar Lee Masters":["Immortality is not a gift, Immortality is an achievement; And only those who strive mightily Shall possess it.","To put meaning in one's life may end in madness, But life without meaning is the torture Of restlessness and vague desire-It is a boat longing for the sea and yet afraid.","Those who first oppose a good work, seize it and make it their own, when the cornerstone is laid and memorial tablets are erected.","How shall the soul of a man be larger than the life he has lived?","Beware of the man who rises to power from one suspender."],"Edgar Meyer":["Being authentic can be a good thing in that often people who are fixated on that are also fixated on having very high standards, so they may maintain something they think has tremendous value. On the other hand, most of the kinds of music that I've been excited about are hybrid in their origins.","When I was younger, I had a much better connection between words and music. Somewhere along the way, I had kind of an aspiration to disconnect them, to just kind of go into a totally musical world.","In all honesty, titles are an embarrassment to me.","I try to just be the person I am, with a lot of sensitivity to the genre in which I'm playing.","I like writing for individuals with really rich musical personalities.","From the first moment that I can remember, I had identified myself as a bass player and it had everything to do with my father, who was a bass player. And he loved music, you know, as much as anybody I've ever seen. And that dynamic I just thought as somehow was a straight pass to me.","I can tell you I'm not exactly sure why I teach. I think a lot of it is just it's the sense of community. A real desire to be involved both with people older than myself and people younger."],"Edgar Mitchell":["We should be ready to reach out beyond our planet and beyond our solar system to find out what is really going on out there.","I happen to be privileged enough to be in on the fact that we have been visited on this planet, and the UFO phenomenon is real.","Death may simply be an alteration in consciousness, a transition for continued life in a nonmaterial form.","You develop an instant global consciousness, a people orientation, an intense dissatisfaction with the state of the world, and a compulsion to do something about it. From out there on the moon, international politics looks so petty.","I theorize that there is a spectrum of consciousness available to human beings. At one end is material consciousness. At the other end is what we call 'field' consciousness, where a person is at one with the universe, perceiving the universe. Just by looking at our planet on the way back, I saw or felt a field consciousness state.","At the end of October 4 in 1957, when I was coming back from sea duty in the South Pacific, Sputnik went up. I realized that humans would be right behind robot aircraft or spacecraft even though I really had no plans of being in aviation or a professional aviator and certainly not in the military.","Our mission on Apollo 14 was to be the first to do science on the moon, so we had to be careful about getting everything in during the allotted time.","I don't think there is much value in trying to use the moon as a base to go to Mars. That's going into one gravity belt and having to get back out of it again. And the moon doesn't have a lot to offer as a resource base.","We do need different types of propulsion to get to Mars. I wrote one of the first Ph.D. theses on that in the 1960s.","We need a community of nations capable of space flight because we all have to be off this planet sometime in the future. Our sun is going to burn out eventually, and we are not in a sustainable situation.","My wife tells me I am a male chauvinist pig and I have to sort of admit it. In my office and in my home, I'm not very democratic. I think of myself as a benevolent dictator.","I had studied at Harvard and MIT astronomy and a lot about the heavens and the star system and so forth.","The best experience that we have on Earth is the fact that we have scientific stations, weathering over stations down in the Antarctic for almost the entire 20th century to learn how to exist in exceedingly hazardous conditions; and the Moon is far more hazardous than Antarctica. At least they have water there."],"Edgar Quinet":["Universal orthodoxy is enriched by every new discovery of truth: what at first appeared universal, by wishing to stand still, sooner or later becomes a sect.","What we share with another ceases to be our own.","An effeminate education weakens both the mind and the body.","The law of humanity ought to be composed of the past, the present, and the future, that we bear within us; whoever possesses but one of these terms, has but a fragment of the law of the moral world.","Time is the fairest and toughest judge.","It is certain that if you would have the whole secret of a people, you must enter into the intimacy of their religion.","Science is Christian, not when it condemns itself to the letter of things, but when, in the infinitely little, it discovers as many mysteries and as much depth and power as in the infinitely great."],"Edgar Ramirez":["For me, no ideological or political conviction would justify the sacrifice of a human life. For me, the value of life is absolute, with no concessions. It's not negotiable.","War is a tragedy. It's not pretty, and in my opinion, there are no winners. Everybody's a victim, from the one who's suffering pain to the person inflicting it.","Everything goes in waves. Evolution goes in waves. The ocean goes in waves. Energy goes in waves. Sound travels in waves.","Boxing, in the most general terms, is a poor man's sport. All you have is your hands to make a living.","That's what happens in a good horror movie: there are always metaphors of greater subjects like humanity and empathy and compassion. It's not about the action and scary moments: You really care about these characters because they're mirrors of our own reflections.","Boxing is all about how cool and controlled and clear your mind is. Violence only gets in the way of you winning a fight. It's a sport that's more about the strategy than anything. You lose or you win in your head.","Boxing combines, in perfect proportion, strength, speed, and endurance. Normally, most sports are either about one of the three: either about speed or endurance or strength. Boxing combines all three of them. It's really intense.","We are all seduced by charismatic people, whether it's in your office or in the bus or in the train. There are people who just, like, come through the door, and everybody turns around and looks at them and feels drawn to them.","I believe in the will. I believe in discipline. I believe in the organization. I believe in the rigor that gives us work. I believe in love as an engine of all things. I believe in the light. I believe in God. I believe in kindness.","Panama is a country that's been dealing with issues of identity since its very birth. It was born on Wall Street. It was born out of engineering construction. It was the canal. Because of the canal, the country was born, so the country has been divided into pro-canal and against-canal people for so long.","We all have very personal relationships to what happened on 9/11 and the events after tracking Osama bin Laden. Nobody can escape from the influence of that.","I'm acting for the same reasons I wanted to become a diplomat. I've thought about it a lot and concluded that I wanted to become a diplomat because it was a way to explore human nature. For the same reason that at one point in college, I wanted to be a sociologist.","I think there's no creative process that goes without injuries and scratches and punches. You get beat up somehow, and that's part of the commitment. You have to be open to that.","In order to understand the mindset of a boxer, I needed to become a boxer myself.","I belonged to the 'Point Break' generation - I watched the original when I was 13 years old. It's basically the story of the rescue of the human spirit, and we continue to fight that same spiritual battle, but with a political expression.","Love is also a very violent thing. Totally violent. Suddenly, you are, like, at this party your friends invite you to, and you meet this person, and your life is turned upside down, and the next day you can't stop thinking about them. That's violent. Hopefully, it's for the better, but it's a violent thing.","I met Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu years ago during my college days, and I was in charge of international promotion of this movie festival he was invited to as part of the jury, and then he saw my work on a short film that was directed by a friend of mine.","You get to a new school, and you're the new guy, or you're the foreigner, or you're the guy with the funny accent. That first day at school was a whole new opportunity to create a new persona.","I'm restless. I'm all the time here and there and trying to get myself busy and creative. It's something that's part of my personality since I was a kid.","One of the pillars of 'Cyrano' is recreating a love story and, like any archetype, these great stories tend to be captivating, among other things, because they are made of those universal things that move us.","Who said that being Latino is to be a stereotype? Characters are stereotypes when making plans or without shades. I do not believe in the picture or model established in the movies.","I have a deep fascination with human nature, with all its virtues and all its defects.","I think that, in the end, the military behavior and intelligence services are not very different from each other. It's an attitude of hunters; they're observing the prey.","My father was a military attache, so I've been traveling all my life.","I've never lived in an English-speaking country, ever, but I lived in Austria. So, my second language is German. And when I went to school, I had a lot of classes in English.","I come from Venezuela, from the independent film arena, and you work with one camera.","I majored in political communications, so I intended to be a diplomat.","My father was military, so I traveled a lot, so I had 13 to 15 first days in new schools. Bullies transcend culture, unfortunately, and I had to deal with them wherever I went. I knew how to defend myself. But I didn't know how to fight.","Panamanian boxing is unique - it's very musical. It's almost like a dance. It has a lot to do with being in the Caribbean and with salsa. When you see a Panamanian boxer, there's a style. There's a playfulness in the way you throw the punches.","To portray not only a boxer but a boxer like Roberto Duran, I needed to understand all the difficulties and the pressures of the sport itself.","If my subject is alive and is willing to talk to me, I will do it. But I always try to find people who were close, like lovers and family members and work colleagues - because we are what we think we are, but we're also the perception that others have of us. The truth is a sphere. There's always a hidden face.","Duran is a mythological figure in Latin America. He grew up in a time of turbulence because Panama was basically occupied by the United States. So he felt obliged to fight Americans in the ring. He felt the whole pride of his country and the need for cultural and political emancipation in his hands.","I'm not an aggressive person at all. But I know how to fight.","If you get conquered by ego, then you are losing the fight.","I remember I would always joke among my friends about a remake of 'Point Break'. I would say, 'You know what? Whenever there's a remake of 'Point Break', I'm going to do it.'","I remember when I first met Katherine Bigelow for 'Zero Dark Thirty' - actually, we met for another movie, and that never got made, and then she called me and invited me to 'Zero Dark Thirty'.","In boxing, there are no bad guys or good guys. Just people trying to make a living and trying to live up to their pride and to try to become someone.","We use the term 'fight' very lightly - 'I've been fighting so hard to get my car, I've been fighting so hard to get that job, I've been fighting so hard to get that girl.' But the reality is boxers do fight bitterly to get whatever they want or whatever they need in life, and most of them come from nothing, which is the case of Roberto Duran.","For me, it was very important to be part of a boxing film that actually explores the psychological aspects of the sport, more than just the physical aspects. I haven't seen boxing movies very often that really go so deep into the minds of the boxers. It really puts out how much it is about strategy and tactics and technique.","Bolivar's legacy has always been a part of the Venezuelan/Latin American imagery, especially in the countries that he liberated or he helped to liberate. He's been a very prominent figure.","It's been a teenage fantasy of mine to play Bodhi.","Imagine stepping into the shoes of Roberto Duran, one of the most legendary boxers in the history of the sport, and definitely the most legendary Latin American boxer, and then having 'Raging Bull' in my corner. I mean, imagine that? Just having Robert De Niro to play the trainer in the movie, that was fantastic.","I'm definitely interested in exploring human contradictions. Contradictions are what make us human - it's what defines us as human beings. Contradictions are what make characters interesting, and I've been lucky to be presented with characters who have a lot of contradictions.","Whenever someone comes up to me saying, 'I saw you in 'Carlos' and then I saw the rest of your movies,' for me, it's an expression that we might be doing something well. So my life hasn't changed that much. I just try not to go to very crowded places if I'm not in the mood.","I had to understand the whole bounty hunting thing, because we don't have that in Venezuela. Nothing similar at all, at least not legal.","There's no way to reconstruct reality. It happened once. What you do is reinterpret and recreate. Even if you have the person who lived it and did it next to you, the event happened just once.","I think, for an actor, the whole world is a place of work because if you focus on characters and on stories, they are everywhere, so yeah, I feel very privileged to have had this great opportunities in the international cinema and especially in the American cinema.","I have a huge promotion: you've heard from me on 'Vantage Point' and also with 'Cyrano Fernandez' - that is a Venezuelan movie that I star in and co-produced, and it's based on the romance of Cyrano de Bergerac. And it's set in a Venezuelan slum. It's a free version of the French play.","I think that the 'Bourne Trilogy,' it's definitely redefined the genre and took it to a new level. It was really great to be part of that experience. It is a very smart movie and a very smart script, great director, and great, you know, fellow actors.","The tale of 'Point Break' is about doing what you love and committing to what you love. It's relevant to me as a Venezuelan, to you as an American, to any Chinese person watching the film.","I'm just the second Bodhi. I think there will be more. I have the feeling this is only the first re-imagination of 'Point Break'.","Feminism is nothing but equality, and actually, feminism benefits men because it liberates us and it releases us from many stigmas imposed by the macho culture on us as well. So if more of us could understand that it's nothing but equality, I think many agendas in terms of equality would have advanced quicker because it really helps us as well.","I think, for any actor, dealing with the paranormal is intriguing.","I am a very active audience member. I want to be moved. I want to be confronted. I want to feel.","Carlos, on paper, and Carlos, the guy who was in jail, is known to be a cultivated guy, the guy who handles big amounts of information, and for me, that was very important.","You can't judge your characters or otherwise; it's not about you, it's about them.","Being enlightened is just being aware. It's just being aware of something that you weren't aware before.","Bodhisattva is enlightened in the Buddhist philosophy, religion, tradition. He's enlightened. It's fine - I don't really fight it - but many people use the term 'zen' and terms like 'nirvana,' 'enlightenment' in an almost superficial way. It's not that complicated.","The reality is that not only were we massively hit in 2008 when the bubble burst, and then we realized how deep the social gap, the economic gap in the world is between the super rich and the poor; also, we realized how impacted the environment has been. So there's been a physical consequence of that.","I look for roles that allow me to immerse in different worlds, immerse in worlds that are different from mine. Then, when you finish a film, you're a different person. I look for that. I look to be impacted, to be transformed, changed by my roles. That's why I do this.","Men are taught that if we are not the ultimate provider, we are a complete failure. We have to be number one in everything we do. There is nothing more delusional or paralysing than what I have just described.","What drew me to the character is that Roberto Duran is the son of an American soldier - a Marine - stationed in Panama and a humble Panamanian mother, and he was abandoned.","I always try to look for the hidden face of the character, the hidden face that we all have.","The truth is not a bidimensional thing; it's not flat. It's rounded; it's like a sphere, so there's always a hidden face. There's one that is revealed because there's light reflecting on it, but there's always a hidden one, and once you go around to see the hidden one, it moves, and that's life.","There's never a dull moment on a David O. Russell set. But that's the beauty of it. That's the magic.","Carlos was a character, a character fabricated by Ilich Ramirez Sanchez, fabricated by the secret services of the epoch, fabricated by the governments of the epoch, by the radical groups of the epoch, by the communications media.","I thought I knew how to work out before I immersed myself into boxing. I now know what an extreme workout really is.","I'm very physical. I love to work out; I'm very athletic. It's a great therapy, not only for my body, but for my mind.","I think that every male actor fantasizes with a boxing film."],"Edgar Rice Burroughs":["I loved her. I still love her, though I curse her in my sleep, so nearly one are love and hate, the two most powerful and devasting emotions that control man, nations, life.","Love is a strange master, and human nature is still stranger.","Anger and hate against one we love steels our hearts, but contempt or pity leaves us silent and ashamed.","Imagination is but another name for super intelligence.","Were there no desire there would be no virtue, and because one man desires what another does not, who shall say whether the child of his desire be Vice or Virtue?","She did not admire him any more than she had. It was merely that she considered him the Lesser of two evils.","The more one listens to ordinary conversations the more apparent it becomes that the reasoning faculties of the brain take little part in the direction of the vocal organs.","Death, only, renders hope futile.","It never seems to occur to some people, that, like beauty, a sense of humor may sometimes be fatal.","I write to escape; to escape poverty."],"Edgar Winter":["But when I played Woodstock, I'll never forget that moment looking out over the hundreds of thousands of people, the sea of humanity, seeing all those people united in such a unique way. It just touched me in a way that I'll never forget.","Music is very spiritual, it has the power to bring people together.","We started out when I was 6 years old. We played ukuleles and sang Everly Brothers songs.","I really had little interest in becoming famous. When I write my book, it will be my guide to avoid becoming a rock star.","As far as I'm concerned, blues and jazz are the great American contributions to music.","I just want to thank all my fans for their loyalty and support-for coming out to the shows and buying the CDs.","I can't imagine anything more worthwhile than doing what I most love. And they pay me for it.","There's a bootleg album that was recorded when I was 14 or 15, a compilation of things live at different clubs. Songs like Girl from Ipanema and Cry Me A River. I don't know what the title of it is.","The most profound, tangible influence in my life has been my wife, Monique. I don't know that I would even be alive were it not for her, and I certainly would not be the person that I am today.","I hadn't realized the number of people that are still interested in listening to what I am doing, people I would never know about if not for being online.","I liked the more sophisticated urban style of blues like Ray Charles and B. B. King, Bobby Blue Bland, Lou Rawls; people like that with more of a tendency toward jazz.","When I was first starting out, you'd have to bang an old upright piano and stick a mike in it and it would always feed back and you could never turn it up loud enough to be heard and I would beat my hands black and blue and bloody.","I started out playing ukulele when I was 5 or 6 years old.","I'm primarily thought of as a rocker, and certainly 'Frankenstein' had a very dramatic power rock image. It was almost a precursor of heavy metal and fusion. But I also love jazz and classical and if there's one common thread that runs through all my music, it is blues.","I believe that blues and jazz are the two uniquely American contributions into music.","So yeah, I am definitely a blues man at heart.","I love music more just in and of itself. I love harmony and rhythm.","I guess that I'm primarily thought of as a rocker, largely because of 'Frankenstein' being such a heavy song - you know, it was really hard rock, almost a precursor of heavy metal and just the image of the synthesizer. I happened to be the first guy to get the idea of putting a strap on the keyboard.","I think The Doors are one of the classic groups, and I think we're all tempted to feel like the time in which we grew up was somehow special, but I really do believe that there were two golden eras in music: The Forties and Fifties of big band, jazz and swing, and the Sixties and Seventies of rock. To me, they're really unparalleled.","There is a real formula to writing music, verse, chorus, verse, chorus, bridge. It's very formulaic. The subject matter that you can address in pop music is somewhat restricted. It just doesn't allow that same emotive quality that you can put into poetry.","When I did 'Frankenstein,' the record company said, 'Now you can do 'Dracula' and 'Wolf Man' and we'll call the whole thing Monster Rock!' and I said, 'No, that's not going to happen, I'm not going to do that.' I kind of enjoy defying categorization. I love music in and of itself. I love the beauty of harmony and rhythm.","I've always considered myself something of a musical rebel.","I played Woodstock in '69, and it really changed my life. Without a doubt, it was the single event that really changed the way I felt about music. Up to that point, I hadn't really thought of myself as more serious musician, and I didn't really have that much interest in pop music.","I get really tired of hearing of all these old rockers whine and complain about how hard life on the road can be. Just stop if you don't like it. I don't think of it as work. I love it all.","There's just no telling what I'll do. But I can say for certain I will continue to play, record, and put out music."],"Edgar Wright":["If you go back to your home town or you're reunited with school friends, its always slightly bittersweet because as much as there's nice things in terms of seeing them again, the town has changed without you, and you're no longer a part of it.","I'm very happy with my life and career, but I do find myself having serious attacks of nostalgia, and I don't quite know why. Even though I've got to travel the world and do amazing things, I still want to go back to my teenage years and change little aspects of it. It's strange, but it does continue to bug me.","Television was essentially my college.","I use music to focus, like an internal motor.","We need to make more original movies, and audiences would do well to support original movies for the future of the medium.","Maybe directors who are more interested in realism and naturalism come from cities, where they see things on their doorstep every day. But growing up as a kid in a very pretty but ever-so-slightly boring town, where not a great deal happened, encouraged me to be more escapist, more imaginative, and more of a daydreamer.","I first saw Walter Hill's second film, 'The Driver,' as a teenager, late at night on the BBC, quite possibly sitting too close to the telly. Given that this 1978 slice of neo-noir takes place almost entirely in the dark streets of a deserted downtown L.A., it's really a perfect midnight movie.","I think it's good to have pressure on yourself. The worst crime is to get kind of really complacent.","Whenever I'm writing a script, I'm scoring myself by playing the right kind of music.","If you're on a road trip, you need driving music.","When I was younger, I used to love Tim Burton's 'Batman.' I was, like, 15, and even then, I was aware, 'This is really the Joker's film.' It's like, the Joker just takes over, and Batman, you really don't learn too much about him.","A lot of recent comic book adaptations have gone two ways: either they're striving for some kind of realism, like 'Iron Man' or 'The Dark Knight,' or they're very stylised and gritty, like 'Sin City' and '300.'","I found, after the experience of making 'Shaun Of The Dead' and then returning to the blank page - because 'Shaun Of The Dead' was the first screenplay I ever wrote properly - the experience of returning to the blank page and having nothing in the drawer was intensely painful.","There are plenty of movies that you need to chew on a bit. Movies that you return to and see something different in the second time around.","I think you write the film that you want to see, and you try and do it honestly, and you can't control people's responses, really.","I am always watching old films and trying to fill gaps in my knowledge.","When I was at school, I used to end every school day with fountain pen ink all over my hands and face and down my shirt.","What 'Shaun of the Dead' and 'Hot Fuzz' and 'World's End' do is smuggle a different movie under the guise of a zombie movie or a cop or alien invasion movie. Even though they all have action and carnage, they are really films about growing up and taking responsibility.","I always liked movies like 'American Graffiti' and 'Gregory's Girl.' 'Gregory's Girl' is particularly perfect because it really captures that summer holiday bubble of teenage utopia. Even though it's got a happy ending, there's a feeling that these characters may never see each other again.","I loved the idea of somebody literally fighting for love.","It's a very rare and fortunate position to be able to make movies with two of your best friends who happen to be really amazing actors and writers.","The sci-fi movies I grew up with, the metaphor was very rich, and they used to really mean something: David Cronenberg's films, or John Carpenter's films, or the Phil Kaufman and Don Segel versions of 'Invasion Of The Body Snatchers,' or George Romero's early zombie films.","'RoboCop,' when that came out, was like the best comic book movie ever, and it's not based on a comic book.","When you're struggling to get a feature film off the ground, there's no big overarching tenure plan or anything like that.","Car chases are as painstaking to make as they are fun to watch. They take a lot of time, and you have to keep the energy up.","The worst thing you can do after a test screening is slash it for the lowest common denominator.","We were shooting 'Hot Fuzz' in my hometown of Wells, Somerset, and I remember looking at the dailies and going, 'Wait, there's a Starbucks in the shot. I don't remember that being there!' We had to digitally remove it; the same thing happened with a McDonald's in another scene. I had this sensation of, 'What's going on here? Where am I?'","Wes Anderson deserves an award for sheer persistence of vision.","I know it's become an ongoing thing about whether videogames are art, and I think there's plenty of examples of things that use the form in a fascinating way. Things that are more surreal or artistic, like 'Katamari Damacy' or 'Vib-Ribbon.'","Growing up, there were TV shows that were very funny but very traditional. Classic things like 'Fawlty Towers,' obviously, and 'Blackadder' were pretty traditionally shot. And then there were the ones that start to break the mold or be really ambitious. The ones that spring particularly to mind would be 'The Young Ones.'","I've always been fascinated by horror films and genre films. And horror films harbored a fascination for me and always have been something I've wanted to watch and wanted to make.","I definitely went through a period when I was a teenager when every girl was 'The One' and every break-up was the 'Worst Thing That Had Ever Happened.'","When I went to college, I discovered the Sega console, and 'Sonic the Hedgehog' became very dear to me.","I used to stay up all night playing 'Resident Evil 2,' and it wouldn't stop until the sun came up. Then I'd walk outside at dawn's first light, looking at the empty streets of London, and it was like life imitating art. It felt like I'd stepped into an actual zombie apocalypse.","I tire of franchises, remakes, and endless sequels.","For 120 minutes, 'Birdman' floats from comedy to surrealism to high drama to quiet brilliance. I felt so inspired by watching this movie. It reaches for the sky and never comes back down to earth.","Between the ages of 18 and 20, I made three hour-long films. One was a superhero film called 'Carbolic Soap.' One was a cop film called 'Dead Right.' And the other was called 'A Fistful Of Fingers.'","My parents used to talk about Sergio Leone films a lot. And I got really into them. I love Clint Eastwood. I love the camera angles. I love the music.","By the time I got to Bournemouth Art College, I'd been so inspired by Sam Raimi and Robert Rodriguez and their tiny, no-budget films that I decided to do a feature-length version of 'Fistful Of Fingers.'","I think the premise of somebody trying to recreate a night from their teenage years stuck with me as something potentially very tragically comic.","I'd like to do some things over again. I never want to repeat anything that went well, though - I just want to do better at slightly different things.","I would say 'American Werewolf in London' is like an unconventional buddy movie: even if the buddy dies 20 minutes in, he still remains throughout the picture, and their partnership is one of the best things in the movie.","I guess a lot of comic-book adaptations strive for realism. Christopher Nolan is making Batman seem very real and very serious.","I think where the criticism of videogames come from is where videogames are just Xeroxes of films, and when you get a film adaptation of that game, you've just Xeroxed something twice. I think that's where a lot of the criticism comes from - there are ultra-violent games that are already based on a million films.","It's funny: sometimes with 'Spaced,' people would try and read too much into something I'd done, with the references meaning something more than they do.","When you're doing a car chase movie, you're sitting in car waiting for places or grips or stuff for quite a while.","If you ever watch police chases on, like, helicopter cams, they very quickly become nightmarish when you start to see the police coming in from the edge of the frame. I always find that terrifying.","In a lot of action films, a lot of guys are driving muscle cars or vintage cars, whereas in reality, a lot of getaway drivers would actually choose, like, commuter cars and find a way to blend into freeway traffic as quickly as possible.","Usually if I find a film that's challenging, that I'm intrigued by, I want to watch it again knowing what the ending is. I found that with something like 'The Godfather Part II.' I think it took me three watches to fully experience it in the way it was intended.","Sometimes, some things have to settle, and you have to think about the intention of it.","There have been recorded cases of people learning how to fly a plane after playing a flight simulator, but there's never been a case of someone learning to fight by playing 'Tekken.'","The idea of fighting your new girlfriend's ex-lovers, 'Street Fighter' style, is the ultimate geek wish-fulfilment.","The making of documentaries for 'Humanoids From The Deep,' 'Galaxy Of Terror' and 'Forbidden World' are absolutely fascinating.","When I am not working, I try to watch more than one film a day if I can.","Usually in TV... A TV director could be anything from a main grip to just a glorified cameraman, and sometimes a director can be the person who is hired last. It's very much a producer's medium.","I just remember watching 'Brass Eye' and being so utterly blown away by the scope of it and how much it managed to cram into an episode.","Some people are brilliant on the first take, some people are brilliant on the fourth take, and when you are doing a group scene, you kind of have to figure that out.","It's interesting that some people reading the comics see Scott Pilgrim as a blank slate in that they like to imagine themselves as Scott Pilgrim, so it's interesting that there are two kind of schools of thought about the character. One is, like, Scott Pilgrim is awesome. The second is Scott Pilgrim believes himself to be awesome.","You get some directors, and I can never understand it - there's a thing they call the 'video village' where all the monitors are, and you've probably seen it on set visits - I hate that! I never, ever like sitting in video village. I get either my own monitor or a hand held monitor, and I stand right by the camera.","'Don't Look Now' is a masterpiece. I think it's the best-edited movie of all time. I adore it.","All of my films have been very dialogue-heavy, and that's great. It always makes it more of a challenge to market in other countries.","I like watching films that can play in any language because they're essentially silent.","I think, 'Scott Pilgrim,' it was something where the general audience didn't necessarily understand straight away what it was.","'Scott Pilgrim' is something that was a little bit more difficult to put in one box. But, to me, that's not necessarily a bad thing about the movie.","I remember seeing 'Gremlins' and having my mind blown and seeing 'Ferris Bueller's Day Off' at 13, and it was this hugely aspirational experience.","I have this theory about science fiction movies in that, when the space race sort of died, a lot of people sort of lost hope.","When I was a kid, I just figured we'd be living on the moon by the year 2000.","Once people realized that, 'Hey, we're going to be left on Earth here, and everything is going to hell quickly,' sci-fi soon became about our own self-destruction.","Critics should think about how the opening weekend audience might want to discover some surprises for themselves.","In 'Shaun of the Dead,' it's not Shaun's fault that there's a zombie apocalypse - he just has to get through the day.","I had a chance to do 'Ant-Man' in 2011.","Occasionally, you'll get a 'District 9,' a film that is politically charged, but there is nothing going on beneath the surface with a lot of horror films. They are not about anything.","I love horror, sci-fi and action, or I wouldn't make these kinds of movies, but those designations are Trojan horses to make these personal comedies.","I'm a big fan of films that I grew up on and would watch obsessively, over and over again. If I didn't feel like I got everything on the first watch good, I want to see it again immediately.","My favorite film of all time is 'Raising Arizona.' I watched it again as soon as it was over. I had it on VHS, rented it, and I watched it and said, 'I want to watch that again, right now.' I think I did the same with something like 'Goodfellas,' which is a completely different genre.","I'd rather try and cram in another two gags than leave a pause to say, 'Hey, wasn't that bit funny?'","Every time I watch a Clint Eastwood film, I'm in touch with my feminine side, I've developed a searing man-crush on Clint Eastwood.","I remember when we did 'Shaun of the Dead,' and when we were trying to get it off the ground in 2001 before we actually made it, a lot of people just didn't want to know.","Usually, if you read a script by somebody else and there's a dense page of stage directions, people just skip through it or speed read it.","Some actors don't even read the stage directions at all.","I'm a big believer in keeping the stage directions really tight.","Mel Brooks is an interesting one because he started out making films about stuff that he was totally affectionate about, like musicals, westerns, horror films, Hitchcock films. And then, as they get further on, and you get to 'Spaceballs,' then it's just kind of contrived.","I love the Zucker brothers' films - 'Airplane!,' 'Top Secret' and 'Police Squad!' - are my formative experiences.","When you write something, at first you might feel very defensive and protective of every single thing, but after a while, you just see what works and what doesn't. Sometimes you do test screenings, and an audience tells you that, or sometimes you eventually just go, 'Let's cut the joke out.'","Tony Scott, Walter Hill, Michael Mann - I'm a big action fan, full stop. And even though Michael Mann is the more celebrated film-maker than Tony Scott, I love them both in different ways.","If you have ever driven around London and seen the amount of one way systems... they basically rubbed out all car chase crime. In fact, if you get bank robberies in the U.K., they're using scooters.","Not everybody fantasizes about robbing a bank, but I think most people have that fantasy of being in a high speed chase.","When we made 'Shaun of the Dead,' it was our first feature, and we were just lucky to make a film, full stop.","We got offers to make sequels to both 'Shaun of the Dead' and 'Hot Fuzz,' and they never really interested us because we like having these endings where it seems very final but could hint at some kind of future adventure that you'll never see.","There are lots of films I wish stopped at installment number one. I like 'Back to the Future Part II' and 'Part III' enough, but I still like the ending of the first one better.","I grew up on Marvel and, like, '2000 AD.'","I was never a DC kid - I went through a phase from, like, 11 to 17 where I would try to buy as many Marvel titles as possible. And '2000 AD' was kind of the sort of sci-fi/punk of British comics.","I find just in terms of free time I'm always envious of people I know who... listen to music, watch films, play games, read books. I have to pick. And I find frequently that if I've got Sophie's Choice, I'll try to keep up with music and keep up with films. So my book reading and comic reading and game playing is terrible and infrequent.","I grew up on 'Battle of the Planets.'","I'm very happy with the response for everything I've done, but, you know, sometimes you get things like, 'Oh, 'Spaced' Series One wasn't as good as 'Spaced' Series Two.' Or 'Shaun of the Dead' is not as good as 'Spaced,' or, 'Hot Fuzz' is not as good as 'Shaun.' Or, now, 'The World's End' is not 'Shaun of the Dead.'","You cannot put 50 years of the Marvel universe into a movie. It's impossible.","Comics have years to explain this stuff, and in a movie, you have to focus on one thing. So it's about kind of streamlining, I think. Some of the most successful origin films actually have a narrower focus.","'The Driver' wasn't commercially successful at the time, but when I was a teenager, I had no knowledge of that.","When I did 'Hot Fuzz,' I tried to get Barbara Steele in the movie, but I was told she had retired.","I was at art school that had quite a celebrated film course as well. I tried for that film course when I was 18, but they said I was too young. I tried this audio and visual design course instead. Two years later, I reapplied for that higher course, but they said I was still too young and to try in five years.","The first TV show I worked on was with the guys from 'Little Britian,' Matt Lucas and David Walliams, who did a show in 1995 I directed, 'Mash and Peas.'","One of the reasons for me that there's no 'Spaced 3' is that I don't think you can pretend to be 26 for ever.","The man-child in American comedies is always glorified; they never really show the darker side."],"Edgard Varese":["I dream of instruments obedient to my thought and which with their contribution of a whole new world of unsuspected sounds, will lend themselves to the exigencies of my inner rhythm.","Contrary to general belief, an artist is never ahead of his time but most people are far behind theirs.","Music, which should pulsate with life, needs new means of expression, and science alone can infuse it with youthful vigor.","There is an idea, the basis of an internal structure, expanded and split into different shapes or groups of sound constantly changing in shape, direction, and speed, attracted and repulsed by various forces.","I don't want to write any more for the old Man-power instruments and am handicapped by the lack of adequate electrical instruments for which I now conceive my music.","I was not influenced by composers as much as by natural objects and physical phenomena.","I have just begun a work in which an important part is given to a large chorus and with it I want to use several of your instruments - augmenting their range as in those I used for my Equatorial - especially in the high range.","Everyone is born with genius, but most people only keep it a few minutes.","Our musical alphabet is poor and illogical.","Music is organized sound."],"Edgardo Osorio":["Florence is charming, cozy, beautiful, inspiring - it has so many great places to go to and so many unique things to see that you won't find anywhere else!","Historically, I think you can really judge a person by their shoes.","I love art, being so close to the galleries, being by the water - and sunsets from the terrace.","I design flats like I design heels: They must be seductive, beautiful and comfortable.","I was surrounded by women and all I would hear is of them complaining about their shoes. Back then, 'comfort' was a dirty word in fashion footwear. This was before fur loafers or sneakers. So, I wanted to create a shoe that was like slipping your foot into a glove - something beautiful, feminine, and sexy at the same time.","My shoes aren't minimalist, but they are about a new simplicity.","The shoes and the eyes are windows to a woman's spirit.","When I sit down and design, it's shoes that always appear.","I was lucky that I started very young, since I had a very clear idea of what I wanted to do. But my father is very conservative, and he never considered fashion to be a real career but something I could pursue as a hobby. He wanted me to be a doctor, and at one point, I thought of becoming a plastic surgeon.","I love to turn an idea that is in my head into reality.","I want to know who my client is. I see her on Instagram, but it's another thing to get to chat with her.","I've had many ideas come from clients.","My retail partners, they are my brand ambassadors. They're the ones who are selling the shoes to women.","America is our biggest market, and I really do believe if you can make it in New York, you can make it anywhere.","No one needs anything; they have to want it.","We do high heels, and people know us for that, but the idea of wearing a flat from day to night feels special.","People want fashion from us, whereas they might buy core styles from other designers.","Every woman looks good in a flamenco dress.","A sexy shoe is one that men like.","We have such a loyal following in London that we decided to open a shop, and I find Albemarle Street extremely charming and special.","I like the idea of sending my Aquazurra girls out with a lucky charm under their feet.","Shoes are very emotional. For women, they carry the message that you want to give to the world. One day you want to be sexy, or super powerful at your job - you wear a great pump. If you want to be on-the-go and running after your kids - you wear a great flat.","Women dress very much according to their moods, so when you see their shoes, it really shows you the character and what they want to show to the world, and what they are feeling at that time.","I have so much fun because I love to meet the women who wear my shoes and meet the clients. That, to me, is the best part - getting to know the faces of the people who actually wear my shoes and getting to have a conversation with them.","I started doing flats because women would always apologize for wearing them when they met me, as if they had to be in heels when meeting a shoe designer.","I wanted to create flats that are as chic as heels - flats you don't have to apologize for.","I like statement flats that can take you from day to night.","I still work weekends because I like it; I enjoy it. I just don't care.","I got the same industry experience in five years that someone else might have had in 15.","I personally approve all the shoes that go into production, and I have a level of involvement with the factories that other people don't have.","I went to department stores, and there was nothing that I really loved. All the shoes were too complicated, too crazy, too ridiculous, too extreme. The platforms were so high; the shoes were so ugly, covered in crystals and feathers and crap. I just thought, 'Maybe somebody wants a beautifully simple, sexy shoe that they can actually walk in.'","Up until the 1960s, women would meet designers in their private ateliers, and together they would build a relationship and a wardrobe. Then, all of a sudden, designers disappeared into their own private bubble, and there was no communication.","For me, it's important that I can talk to my customers all over the world. They can comment on what they like, tell me what fits - we have a daily dialogue. I can also see what she looks like and how she wears my shoes, which is a huge advantage. Thank God for Instagram; it helps me keep connected.","There's something special about shoes, they give you a high like nothing else.","Even though my shoes are different from Ferragamo's aesthetic, which is more classic, I learned the importance of fit and quality. We were making shoes like they used to, by hand, and I carried that with me.","When I started out, the idea of comfort in shoes was almost a dirty word.","I was the first one to say that there could be comfortable, sexy shoes, and it's a big part of our brand.","I want you to be able to go to Aquazzura and find a shoe for every occasion, whether that's a red carpet ball or picking up your kids from school.","For some reason, many designers are in fashion, but they don't love women. I love women, and I follow my clients on Instagram.","As a male designer, you always need a woman's touch.","I think of my customer as a woman who wants to look beautiful and be able to walk.","I got a New York designer to build my dream store here, which is a little bit of Florence in New York. It's like the Duomo on Madison. I got inspired by Santa Maria Novella and all the Renaissance architecture.","Avoid patent leather, pink, and crystals.","I never met a stripe I didn't like.","I've always wanted to create shoes that were positive and happy.","Whenever I went to a wedding or a party, girls kept complaining about their shoes. I love to dance, and I wanted them to have shoes they could keep on all night.","It's as if to be interesting, you had to be depressed and messy, but that's complete nonsense.","I love to see a woman in a sexy, strappy sandal no matter what. It just looks beautiful.","What I always say to people is dress from the feet up. If you don't normally wear colour, try some colour on your feet; it's the place, I think you can have fun and update your outfit.","You can wear a beautiful black dress that you've maybe had for years, but if you wear a fun shoe, you can completely change it. Wear something different, something sexy, something strappy, or something with pom poms.","I think every celebrity that I love wears my shoes. I'm a particular fan of Julianne Moore, and I adore Jennifer Lawrence. There are so many beautiful women. I love Poppy Delevingne, of course; I even made a collection with her.","Being inspired is one thing, but completely knocking off a design is another. There is a big difference.","When people take advantage of you and make a business out of it, that's not nice.","Sometimes you design a shoe, and you think this one is a winner, but you never know when something will be such a crazy phenomenon.","For me, I knew the Christy flat was a beautiful shoe, but I had no idea the incredible trend that would follow - I mean, it's the most copied thing ever!","No one wears high heels all day, every day.","I want to make shoes that a woman can walk in. That's kind of what they're made for."],"Edi Gathegi":["I am sort of an adventurer. I like to explore new places. I don't get to travel as often as I would like but I love it.","Villains are fun to play.","I have died in enough TV and films.","I think that different actors go about their preparation differently, but when it comes to acting, I use my imagination.","New York is the only city that I have ever lived in that I have felt at home."],"Edi Rama":["Things can change only through strong personalities. I am not very good at supporting ignorance and mediocrity, so maybe this leads to arrogant gestures and arrogant responses. So, nobody's perfect.","Compromise in colors is grey.","Politics has come to resemble a cynical team game played by politicians, while the public has been pushed aside as if sitting on the seats of a stadium in which passion for politics is gradually making room for blindness and desperation.","Albania is going through a deep crisis because it lacks the rule of law, an independent judiciary, and freedom of the media. I don't think if we stop protesting the problem is solved.","In my previous life, I was an artist. I still paint. I love art.","For 11 years, I was mayor of Tirana, our capital. We faced many challenges. Art was part of the answer, and my name, in the very beginning, was linked with two things: demolition of illegal constructions in order to get public space back, and use of colors in order to revive the hope that had been lost in my city.","When people say all politicians are the same, ask yourself if Obama was the same as Bush, if Francois Hollande is the same as Sarkozy. They are not. They are human beings with different views and different visions for the world.","I still paint. I love the joy that color can give to our lives and to our communities. I try to bring something of the artist in me to my politics.","I'm not sure I am a politician. I would say that I am still an artist, and I'm trying to use politics as an instrument for change.","I strongly believe in political activity that has to do with choices - and not consensus that sometimes covers problems and doesn't resolve them.","I entered politics from a completely different background from other people in this field, and that has helped me to see and deal with things differently."],"Edie Adams":["All the dreamers in all the world are dizzy in the noodle.","You aren't going to leave me alone are you?","Well, we could tell them that we're here on an archeological expedition."],"Edie Brickell":["My grandmother was the greatest cook in the world. She could just go in there, the whole kitchen would look like a tornado hit it and then she'd come out with the best food. Then she'd sit at the table and she wouldn't eat!","But who cares? I can honestly look back and realize that everything happened for a reason. Everything that fell apart has fallen back into place beautifully and magically.","A lot of the songs start with an image. I was sitting there playing the guitar and I pictured this old, dirty green car, with the window rolled down, in the hot, hot, hot Texas heat, and this beautiful woman I knew when I was a kid sitting behind the wheel, looking out at me.","We didn't rehearse or play the songs to death before we recorded them, and that let us catch a freshness and energy level we've never really felt while making records.","I need to go outside. I wouldn't say I'm an outdoors person, but I like to go outside.","I hope I'm better today than I was yesterday. I don't believe in glory days or anything like that, so I think the best is tomorrow or later this afternoon!","You're just playing, playing, playing, and then an image or something will come into your mind, and basically you're just narrating it with music, letting it move along.","You feel like a prisoner if you don't create. You're jailed up inside of yourself.","You can look back at anything and wish you'd done something differently.","When I look at my kids, and the ease with which they pick up music, I wish I had that.","We were too young to know better, and none of us were very aggressive people. It would have helped a lot if just one of us had been aggressive enough to say no.","No matter how famous and established they were or however blessed they were with great songs or long careers, if they lived alone, they lived alone. That's not the way I wanted to live prior to the tour or after.","My son writes songs and plays. He sings like an angel.","If it turns out to be a hit, well, good luck dealing with fame. And if it's not a hit and you can still survive and make music you believe in, well, then you're truly blessed. I think that's where we are now.","I think the New Bohemians' inability to say no was a big part of our problem.","I like Rufus Wainwright a whole lot. He makes me wanna be even more musical.","I have taken the marshmallows off the sweet potatoes, however. They would make a big pan of sweet potatoes and cover it with marshmallows. My kids would love it if I would do that for them!","I can make dressing - or stuffing. Y'all call it stuffing up here, we call it dressing down there. It's really good dressing. That family recipe was passed on, and I love to make that.","Geffen was never supportive of the band.","But when it came to jamming and writing songs like we used to, we realized Brandon was a huge spirit in the band. Who knew? It was just something we had to learn.","But I really love music, and having a creative outlet is really the best thing you can do for yourself.","Becoming a mom made me more contentious about expressing my true taste.","And I was very comfortable with this band even when we disagreed. It takes a long time to feel comfortable enough to disagree with somebody. When everything happened, it just was really confusing. It's like our weaknesses were nurtured and brought out front by outsiders."],"Edie Campbell":["I think TV shows have usurped films!","I don't worry about chemicals. There are enough chemicals entering my body through all the fizzy drinks I consume to worry if my lip balm is 100 per cent organic.","There's a thing in the U.K., particularly in London, where it's kind of the idea of subculture and counterculture and the outside and the idea that it's great to be a freak, and the freak always wins. So I think English girls are a lot less scared of being the freak or looking like an idiot.","How hard can it be to walk up and down in a straight line? You just need to put one step in front of another; most people do it all the time. What's the worst that can happen? You fall over. Sometimes that happens to non-models, too; it wouldn't be the end of the world.","My role is to embody the Black Opium woman - I suppose you have to be the living embodiment of all the intangible things the brand stands for.","I'd like to work with horses, but it doesn't pay very well. Maybe I'd like to go somewhere in the Middle East because they keep buying really nice horses for their Olympic teams - like, the Qataris.","To be the outsider is actually a great thing in England.","I think Stella Tennant is amazing. And then I really loved all those '60s society models, like Edie Sedgwick.","I needed to pay for my horses in Warwickshire, and I couldn't do that off a waitress' wage.","If you always feel like an imposter, you work harder, and that makes you better at your job. You've got to keep a level of variation; otherwise, you'll end up talking about nails and beauty products all the time.","I just think that the Victoria's Secret girl values herself by the way she looks. And that might be linked with being healthy, but that's all it is, and it sets a negative example to other people.","I like wearing things that are a bit off but not in a ridiculous 'I'm wearing a huge hat' kind of way. More a socks with sandals way.","People need to take a breath and remember that it's only fashion. Relax. No one's going to die.","I've been making a diary of the daft things people have said during London Fashion Week, and it does wear a little bit thin, everyone comparing my name to Edie Sedgwick.","There's really nothing better than a hunt ball.","Sometimes I wake up and think, 'I want to look like Sherlock Holmes today,' and other times I want to look like a witch from 'Macbeth.'","Kristen Stewart always looks good - she wears what she wants. It's the same with Alison Mosshart - she chooses clothes that she loves rather than what she thinks she should wear.","When I was 17, I used to really think about what I wore every day.","I have a terrible habit of shopping after I go to the gym or hitting eBay.","Maybe the Burberry woman is undefinable! I think it's less about what she looks like and more about an attitude.","My favourite smell is horses. In fact, most of the time, I do smell like horses.","If I wasn't modelling, I'd probably be an intern somewhere, working for someone who interned the year before me.","It's amazing to be able to work with people right at the top of whatever they do... inspiring photographers and stylists with very interesting visual language. The more I do it, the more I enjoy it.","It's very good for you, riding. You know how every model is like, 'I do yoga.' Well, I find horses to have the same effect, in that you have to put your ego aside and concentrate on making the horse do the things you want it to do, and move in the way you want it to move - particularly if you're doing dressage.","Everyone Instagrams all the people they are with. I get that it's part of the job. But there's a point where it's like, 'Can't you just be a person and have a separate life to your job?'","I think there is something to be said for not feeling like just because you're a model you have to be dressed up, look amazing, go to every party, and be smiling all the time.","I'm not very good at going to parties and looking like I'm having fun.","The more I mistreat my hair, the stronger it grows back. I think it must be determined to survive.","What I like about Yves Saint Laurent Black Opium is that it's an understated scent that's somehow familiar.","You'll never see me with a precision flick of eyeliner. Messy eyeliner became my thing by accident rather than design. If you can't get it straight, then just work it in around your eyes.","You can't really plan for how that training session or competition is going to go. You have to see what your horse is giving you to work with, and then you tailor all your training around that.","I have a really great show jacket from Lavalliere that's really well made, and I have a great pair of Gucci jodhpurs, which is hilarious.","Everything comes back to the horse, which is why I love it. You put your ego aside, and you concentrate on getting the best performance out of this creature.","I am truly honoured to become ambassadress for Yves Saint Laurent. The brand's modern vision of beauty is very inspiring, and I am particularly proud to represent such an audacious archetype of woman.","I wear clothes and sell products and ideas.","I find it quite boring when people do things that are very considered and thought through. I like things best when they're just done because they're fun or beautiful, or simply because they are what that one person wanted to do at that one time.","I always find Victoria's Secret models a bit weird."],"Edie Falco":["Coming home to my family afterward makes the work richer, easier and more fun.","I'm not sad about any of my life. It's so unconventional. It doesn't look anything like I thought it would.","I love being able to take a nap in the afternoon.","My friends started having children after college, while I was pursuing this crazy acting career and living hand to mouth. Plus, all my boyfriends were artists struggling to make a living. Having kids didn't make any sense - why would I take on more of a financial burden when I couldn't even afford a dog?","I'm a very ritualistic, routine-oriented person, and I discovered over the years that I love working Monday through Friday.","I love to hand sew. I sometimes make clothing for my children, which of course they grow out of in a matter of minutes. I thoroughly love it.","I've also learned to no longer feel guilty if I'm invited out and don't want to go. If I start to say to myself, 'What's wrong with you that you're staying in five nights in a row to watch 'Forensic Files' instead of going out with your friends' I remind myself that it's what I need to do for myself at that point.","My actual personality probably lies someplace between the two.","The second you are handed a newborn it is yours. It doesn't matter what body it came out of. I've never felt more strongly about anything in my life.","I actually washed my window once, and it fell through - it was being held together by the dirt.","And hey-the psychiatrist in the show is Italian also. So people are going to focus on what they want to focus on. There's not much you can do about that.","I wanted to act; that was my one goal. I wanted to devote all my time to acting and not waitressing or anything else.","I was a young kid from Long Island who wanted to do something large with her life, so I can relate to that.","I was able to support myself by acting alone about six years ago. Until then, I was just scraping by.","I've watched those shows my whole life - being on one is like a dream. It's hard to balance that dream with the fact that this is the Edie I've known my whole life.","It's hard to notice things without people noticing me and that takes some getting used to.","One of the ways I think I gain fodder for characters is by watching people.","There were a lot of times I wondered if I was deluding myself. I had nothing else to fall back on, but I never enjoyed anything else.","Well, yeah, but I probably wasn't as open about my desperation.","When a show has gotten as much attention as this one, everyone wants to join in with something to say.","The high-grossing films are not all that interesting to me, I have to say. It's not stuff I would want to be in. Yes, you would want the big paycheck, but that's never really been my concern.","In my household there is an insane amount of laughter and celebration.","My kids have never seen me scream at anybody. They've never seen an argument. There's never been even a cold silence. And those are things that I grew up with because my parents did end up divorcing.","I really am profoundly grateful just in general in my life. I've had an embarrassing amount of good fortune.","I have this dog named Marley, and it is a kind of love I had never known. I have a hard time believing Marley did not come from my body. I know that sounds insane, but I feel that connected to her. She made me realize I wanted to adopt children.","I'm just not one of those people who thought having biological children was that important, to me it was more about wanting to raise a child.","Being a single mother was the right thing for me. But I have a tremendous amount of help from my friends. They're in love with my kids, and my kids are in love with them.","I never really wanted kids. I didn't not want them, but motherhood just wasn't something that pulled at me.","I do not cook.","I sort of love reading the scripts and going, 'Oh wow, what a great idea. I never would have thought of that.'","Is it harder having kids and working? It definitely is, but the payoff is you get to go home to your kids, and it all balances out. And I know I'm a better mother when I'm engaged in something outside of the house.","I think there was a time when I considered myself a work addict, but that's no longer accurate. My life has changed so dramatically over the last number of years, especially having a family now. My priorities have shifted.","It's a very complicated issue, this fame thing - I was not really cut out for it. There are some really fantastic things about it, but it's difficult for a private person like myself.","I don't watch a lot of television.","The world gets very small after a while, if you stick around long enough.","Throughout my career I've played a lot of parts that might've been played by a man. They're human roles rather than specifically men or women. I've never been as hooked into that as a lot of women are, you know, like, 'There aren't enough roles for women.' There aren't necessarily a lot of good roles for anybody.","I grew up kind of a tomboy and I used to fight with all the neighborhood boys.","We're living in a time when parenting is not at all mirroring the way I was parented. For me, I just followed my parents around on their errands; when they were busy on the phone, I was quiet. It's a different kettle of fish these days: They run the house, and you listen to their music, and you go to their appointments.","I don't have examples in my life of people who are all good or bad; I have deeply loved many people who are both, and I relate to those kinds of people on a far greater level.","There's a little good and bad in everyone. Everybody I've ever loved is very complicated.","The common misconception is that as an actress you have to learn what you're doing. No, you just have to make the audience think you've learned it.","I have lots of friends and, like me, they're not married. So my kids have lots of godparents - men and women, gay and straight. My loft is always filled with people helping me out with them and loving them.","I'm an old-school, embarrassing Joni Mitchell fan. Her music made a hook in my soul and hasn't let go for all these years. I even sing her songs as lullabies to my kids.","I've never been all that interested or aware of what people are thinking about me or saying about me. I think that has kept me safest and sanest.","I think that you do get a little extra jolt of confidence when you win an Emmy.","Writers, actors, anybody working on an ensemble-type thing, there are going to be some creaks in the beginning. It seems like there's tremendous potential in just letting things sort of breathe a little bit. It's tremendously important.","I don't know what it must be like to be a writer in general, but to be a comedy writer, it's got to be something - it's a very special kind of talent."],"Edie McClurg":["Self-doubt kills talent.","Don't stink up the place with bad acting, if an opportunity comes your way.","Acting isn't a singular profession, it is a collaborate profession.","I had to give myself permission to act, then others agreed.","Continue to study and learn new skills.","Regarding 'Ferris Bueller,' I was in the Czech Republic once, in Prague, making a movie at the same time as Jeffrey Jones, who played the principal, who was making a different movie. The Super Bowl was going to be playing at this bar at midnight, so we decided we would go watch the Super Bowl at this bar at midnight in Prague together.","John Hughes loved improvisers."],"Edie Sedgwick":["I lived a very isolated life. When you start at 20, you have a lot of nonsense to work out of your system.","You care enough, that you want your life to be fulfilled in a living way, not in a painting way, not in a writing way... you really do want it to be involving in living, corresponding with other living objects, moving, changing, that kind of thing."],"Edith Cavell":["I realize that patriotism is not enough. I must have no hatred or bitterness towards anyone."],"Edith Evans":["When a woman behaves like a man why doesn't she behave like a nice man?","I can't imagine going on when there are no more expectations.","A successful artist of any kind has to work so hard that she is justified in refusing to lay down her sceptre until she is placed on the bier.","What I want to give in the theatre is beauty, that's what I want to give.","I know that if I'd had to go and take an exam for acting, I wouldn't have got anywhere. You don't take exams for acting, you take your courage."],"Edith Hamilton":["When the freedom they wished for most was freedom from responsibility, then Athens ceased to be free and was never free again.","The fullness of life is in the hazards of life.","Theories that go counter to the facts of human nature are foredoomed.","Faith is not belief. Belief is passive. Faith is active.","Great art is the expression of a solution of the conflict between the demands of the world without and that within.","Mind and spirit together make up that which separates us from the rest of the animal world, that which enables a man to know the truth and that which enables him to die for the truth.","A people's literature is the great textbook for real knowledge of them. The writings of the day show the quality of the people as no historical reconstruction can.","None but a poet can write a tragedy. For tragedy is nothing less than pain transmuted into exaltation by the alchemy of poetry.","To be able to be caught up into the world of thought - that is being educated.","When the mind withdraws into itself and dispenses with facts it makes only chaos.","The modern minds in each generation are the critics who preserve us from a petrifying world, who will not leave us to walk undisturbed in the ways of our fathers."],"Edith Head":["Your dresses should be tight enough to show you're a woman and loose enough to show you're a lady.","A designer is only as good as the star who wears her clothes.","You can have anything you want in life if you dress for it.","What a costume designer does is a cross between magic and camouflage. We create the illusion of changing the actors into what they are not. We ask the public to believe that every time they see a performer on the screen, he's become a different person.","Fashion is a language. Some know it, some learn it, some never will - like an instinct.","Many women have asked me if it is possible to have a well-built wardrobe on a limited budget. 'Money,' I tell them, 'is no guarantee of taste, and an overstuffed wardrobe is often as bare as a skeleton when it comes to wearable apparel.'","Some people need sequins, others don't.","Growing old gracefully used to begin at about 35, but today women prefer to 'stay young gratefully' with thanks to designers, beauticians and plastic surgeons.","Even the most beautiful legs - Marlene Dietrich's, for instance - look better when the kneecap is covered.","I always wear beige, black or white. For one thing I look good in them. For another, when I'm beside a star at a fitting, and she looks into the mirror, I don't want to be competing in any way.","My motto is that the audience should notice the actors, not the clothes.","Every different director has another language - for instance, Hitchcock does not like any bright color ever, unless the story says 'there goes the girl in a red dress.'","I have yet to see one completely unspoiled star, except for the animals - like Lassie.","There's no such thing as a standard size movie star, or woman for that matter.","I've dressed thousands of actors, actresses and animals, but whenever I am asked which star is my personal favorite, I answer, 'Grace Kelly.' She is a charming lady, a most gifted actress and, to me, a valued friend.","Before you are interviewed for the job you want, try on the complete outfit you intend to wear.","Many faux pas of fashion can be avoided if you curb your instinctive desire to buy things with your heart instead of your head.","If you hunger for certain types of clothes, for which you have little use, put yourself on a diet. Just as you resist too much whipped cream and French pastry to keep your figure in shape, you can say no to those yearned-for but unneeded purchases that lead to a wardrobe that is shapeless and without form.","Couture has copied my things for years, in addition to countless other costume designers, claiming theirs were the original ideas. It's all part of the business, unfortunately.","We don't make glamorous movies today. Everything now is very realistic, artistic - and depressing. When is the last time you you saw a wonderful musical or a fabulous fantasy?","With women, there's a basic female instinct of caring deeply about the way they look; women stars have a narcissist complex.","Building a proper wardrobe is like building a home. Indeed, you should think of it like a home, because it is something you're going to live in. It must be comfortable and suit all your needs.","As women, we all have certain weaknesses. I know one who can't resist pretty shoes but has nothing suitable to wear with them. Others adore frilly lingerie but never have any money to buy outer clothing.","You can lead a horse to water and you can even make it drink, but you can't make actresses wear what they don't want to wear.","I have yet to see one completely unspoiled star, except for Lassie."],"Edith Pearlman":["I have a skepticism toward romance. I believe that decency and companionship are, in the long run, more important in life.","Architecture is undistinguished, sometimes derelict, but occasionally, as in 'Post and Beam,' there is something arresting in a setting... the building behind the Cathedral.","The natural world is often bleak, but the language devoted to it is as careful as needlepoint and prophetic as well.","I think the computer is a hindrance to good writing because it is so tempting to leave what you've written. If you use a typewriter, you must retype if you make a mistake, and thus, you must re-examine every word.","I wrote in the cellar for a number of years. I needed a private space, and it had a furnace, so it was always warm.","The ordinary experiences of aging alter and clarify your view of past, present, and future.","There's no rule I want to break or ever wanted to break - I find the conventional life gratifying - as long as I can sit at my typewriter, alone, for half a day.","Tony Judt's remarkable 'The Memory Chalet' was written from the prison of mute immobility.","I always loved to read, and I wanted to be part of the project of literature. My physical longevity is due to luck, and my literary longevity is due to my physical longevity.","I know a lot of single people who are not miserable as society tells them they're supposed to be.","I was quite satisfied with my creative life. I've always had reinforcement from a small but devoted readership.","I lived around the corner from Saul Bellow.","All the stories I write come from someone I've met or some anecdote I've heard.","I wanted to publish a book simply to be buried with it; that's all I wanted. I had no ambition beyond that.","The market town of Cheltenham, in Gloucestershire, was a popular 19th - century English spa. Its mineral springs were supposed to be good for you. This was before the invention of bran. In the 20th century, Cheltenham grew into an active municipality.","In the late 1950s, self-esteem hadn't yet been invented. High schools saw their sole mission as preparing students thoroughly for academic work."],"Edith Piaf":["Singing is a way of escaping. It's another world. I'm no longer on earth.","Don't care what people say. Don't give a damn about their laws.","I think you have to pay for love with bitter tears.","I'd like to see one person - just one - who would own up to having been a coward.","As far as I'm concerned, love means fighting, big fat lies, and a couple of slaps across the face.","I wouldn't mind at all coming back to earth after my death.","All I've done all my life is disobey.","Death does not exist.","To be successful in my native France, where people speak the same language and understand me, is nothing.","To sing is to bring to life; impossible if the words are mediocre, however good the music.","Death is the beginning of something.","I don't want to die an old lady.","I want to make people cry even when they don't understand my words.","I've always wanted to sing, just as I've always known that one day I would have my own niche in the annals of song. It was a feeling I had.","I've been thinking about Jesus. Don't you find it a bit strange that, since He was living with His family and all, He up and left them just when they needed him most?","If God has allowed me to earn so much money, it is because He knows I give it all away.","Money? How did I lose it? I never did lose it. I just never knew where it went.","People say that I could sing the phone book and make it sound good.","Tell me what you'd like to hear me sing. I'll sing whatever you like, after which I'll take up a collection, if you don't mind."],"Edith Rogers":["But do not understand me as saying, or for one moment suggesting, that women legislators should confine themselves to doing only social service work. Not at all.","I cannot doubt that women will line up, like the men elected, with the groups whose political thinking and convictions are in accord with their own political convictions.","The farm women are extremely well organized and are bound to be heard from."],"Edith Schaeffer":["People throw away what they could have by insisting on perfection, which they cannot have, and looking for it where they will never find it.","It makes sense that there is no sense without God."],"Edith Sitwell":["My personal hobbies are reading, listening to music, and silence.","I am patient with stupidity but not with those who are proud of it.","The aim of flattery is to soothe and encourage us by assuring us of the truth of an opinion we have already formed about ourselves.","Hot water is my native element. I was in it as a baby, and I have never seemed to get out of it ever since.","A great many people now reading and writing would be better employed keeping rabbits.","I have often wished I had time to cultivate modesty... but I am too busy thinking about myself.","I am an unpopular electric eel in a pool of catfish.","I wish the government would put a tax on pianos for the incompetent.","The public will believe anything, so long as it is not founded on truth.","I have taken this step because I want the discipline, the fire and the authority of the Church. I am hopelessly unworthy of it, but I hope to become worthy.","Poetry is the deification of reality.","The trouble with most Englishwomen is that they will dress as if they had been a mouse in a previous incarnation they do not want to attract attention.","Good taste is the worst vice ever invented.","The poet speaks to all men of that other life of theirs that they have smothered and forgotten.","Still falls the rain - dark as the world of man, black as our loss - blind as the nineteen hundred and forty nails upon the Cross.","I am one of those unhappy persons who inspire bores to the greatest flights of art."],"Edith Stein":["The limitless loving devotion to God, and the gift God makes of Himself to you, are the highest elevation of which the heart is capable; it is the highest degree of prayer. The souls that have reached this point are truly the heart of the Church.","As for what concerns our relations with our fellow men, the anguish in our neighbor's soul must break all precept. All that we do is a means to an end, but love is an end in itself, because God is love.","The nation... doesn't simply need what we have. It needs what we are.","One could say that in case of need, every normal and healthy woman is able to hold a position. And there is no profession which cannot be practiced by a woman.","Every true prayer is a prayer of the Church; by means of that prayer the Church prays, since it is the Holy Spirit living in the Church, Who in every single soul 'prays in us with unspeakable groanings'.","Peoplehood tends to develop into nationhood if the people achieves a certain maturity. This is analogous to an individual person who becomes acquainted with herself only in the course of her life, without being able to say that she possessed no personal uniqueness at all before that 'self-recognition.'","The entire educational process must be carried out with love, which is perceptible in every disciplinary measure and which does not instill any fear. And the most effective educational method is not the word of instruction but the living example without which all words remain useless.","This is a serious warning cry: Surrender without reservation to the Lord who has called us.

Innovation drives economic growth. So let's all go exploring.","Exploring is an innate part of being human. We're all explorers when we're born. Unfortunately, it seems to get drummed out of many of us as we get older, but it's there, I think, in all of us. And for me that moment of discovery is just so thrilling, on any level, that I think anybody that's experienced it is pretty quickly addicted to it.","Exploration is the engine that drives innovation. Innovation drives economic growth.","During my first open ocean dive, I went down to 800 feet and turned out the lights. I knew I would see bioluminescence, but I was totally unprepared for how much. It was incredible! There were explosions of light everywhere, like being in the middle of a silent fireworks display.","I have made hundreds of dives in submersibles, with each dive holding the promise of seeing an organism or a behavior that no one has ever seen before. But I have always wondered about the animals and behaviors that we're not seeing because our bright lights and loud thrusters scare them away.","I just was mesmerized by all of this life everywhere I looked. And so I wanted to be a marine biologist.","The primary way that we know about what lives in the ocean is we go out and drag nets behind ships. And I defy you to name any other branch of science that still depends on hundreds-of-year-old technology. The other primary way is we go down with submersibles and remote- operated vehicles. I've made hundreds of dives in submersibles.","One of the things that's frustrated me as a deep-sea explorer is how many animals there probably are in the ocean that we know nothing about because of the way we explore the ocean.","In 2008, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded for work done on a molecule called green fluorescent protein that was isolated from the bioluminescent chemistry of a jellyfish, and it's been equated to the invention of the microscope in terms of the impact that it has had on cell biology and genetic engineering.","I think I have the best job in the world. Seventy-one percent of the planet is covered by water, we've explored less than five percent of the ocean, and there are so many fabulous discoveries that have yet to be made.","We've only explored about 5% of our ocean. There are great discoveries yet to be made down there - fantastic creatures representing millions of years of evolution and possibly bioactive compounds that could benefit us in ways we can't even imagine.","There's a lot of animals in the open ocean - most of them that make light. And we have a pretty good idea, for most of them, why. They use it for finding food, for attracting mates, for defending against predators. But when you get down to the bottom of the ocean, that's where things get really strange.","Finding animals that make light in the ocean is easy. Just drag a net through the water anywhere in the upper 3000 feet, and as many as 80-90% of the animals you catch can make light. The biomimetic lure that I developed imitates one of these - a common deep sea jellyfish called Atolla.","It is clear that if we are going to understand ocean ecosystems, we need to understand the part that bioluminescence plays in those ecosystems.","Squid experts have been debating for some time about whether the giant squid is a passive predator that just floats around in the water and waits to bump into something. I was never one to imagine it to be passive.","I loved anything to do with animals from a very early age.","I never, ever would have imagined the kind of career I've had. It just wouldn't have occurred to me that anything like this could have been possible. I didn't have any such aspirations. And I still can't believe my good fortune.","For my Ph.D. thesis, I was measuring the electrical activity that triggers light emission from a bioluminescent dinoflagellate. As I was nearing the completion of my degree, my major professor wrote a grant for an instrument for measuring the color of very dim light flashes from bioluminescent animals.","I had wanted to place the Eye-in-the-Sea at an oasis on the bottom of the ocean, in some site rich with life that was likely to be patrolled by large predators. The first time I got to test the camera at such a place was in 2004, in the north end of the Gulf of Mexico, at an amazing location called the brine pool.","It's a little-appreciated fact that most of the animals in our ocean make light. I've spent most of my career studying this phenomenon called bioluminescence. I study it because I think understanding it is critical to understanding life in the ocean where most bioluminescence occurs.","Since my first dive in a deep-diving submersible, when I went down and turned out the lights and saw the fireworks displays, I've been a bioluminescence junky. But I would come back from those dives and try to share the experience with words, and they were totally inadequate to the task. I needed some way to share the experience directly.","In 2010, there was a TED event called Mission Blue held aboard the Lindblad Explorer in the Galapagos as part of the fulfillment of Sylvia Earle's TED wish. I spoke about a new way of exploring the ocean, one that focuses on attracting animals instead of scaring them away.","We've only explored about five percent of our ocean. There are great discoveries yet to be made down there, fantastic creatures representing millions of years of evolution and possibly bioactive compounds that could benefit us in ways that we can't even yet imagine.","We need a NASA-like organization for ocean exploration, because we need to be exploring and protecting our life support systems here on Earth.","The one thing I've learned exploring the deep is that you just can't even begin to imagine some of the bizarre creatures that are down there.","Giant squid aren't rare. Based on the number of beaks that have been found in the stomachs of sperm whales, it's thought that there are actually millions of them in the ocean, and yet, we haven't seen them.","If I go out in the open ocean environment, virtually anywhere in the world, and I drag a net from 3,000 feet to the surface, most of the animals - in fact, in many places, 80 to 90 percent of the animals that I bring up in that net - make light. This makes for some pretty spectacular light shows.","When caught in the clutches of a predator, the jelly produces a light display that is a pinwheel of light that is basically a call for help. It serves to attract the attention of a larger predator that may attack their attacker, thereby affording them an opportunity for escape.","If we are to be good stewards of the ocean, we need to understand what lives there and how the animals interact with each other and with their environment, which means we need to be constantly seeking new and improved methods for exploration and observation.","This is part of what's driving me, is this feeling like there's so much yet to be discovered in the oceans, and we're destroying it before we even know what's in it.","There's a lionfish cookbook put out by the Reef Environmental Educational Foundation, and it tells you how to catch them, how to clean them.","That's a real problem when people bring exotics into their homes. Sometimes it's by accident, but sometimes it's on purpose.","I developed my camera system, called the Medusa, jointly with a colleague down in Australia as a method of exploring the ocean unobtrusively. The critical thing was that we didn't use white light, which I believe has been scaring the animals away.","I developed an optical lure that imitates certain types of bioluminescent displays that I think might be attractive to large predators. The other way to do it is just use dead bait, but I think dead bait attracts scavengers, and we wanted to attract active predators.","Squid don't eat jellyfish, but they eat the things that eat the jellyfish. Jellyfishes put on a lightshow to attract a larger predator. It's caught in the clutches of something like a fish and has no hope for escape unless its lightshow attracts something bigger that will attack their attacker.","The giant squid has the biggest eyes of any animal on the planet. It's a visual predator.","Now we have new tools for exploring the deep and have to pull together a deep exploration program that takes advantage of them."],"Edmond About":["Marriage, in life, is like a duel in the midst of a battle.","But as the Pope has a long arm, which might reach me in France, I have gone a little out of the way to tell him the plain truths contained in these pages.","It was in the Papal States that I studied the Roman Question.

In a sense, they give you a challenge, and you try to express that challenge by climbing them.","People do not decide to become extraordinary. They decide to accomplish extraordinary things.","Life's a bit like mountaineering - never look down.","I think it all comes down to motivation. If you really want to do something, you will work hard for it.","Ever since the morning of May 29, 1953, when Tenzing Norgay and I became the first climbers to step onto the summit of Mount Everest, I've been called a great adventurer.","I think I mainly climb mountains because I get a great deal of enjoyment out of it. I never attempt to analyze these things too thoroughly, but I think that all mountaineers do get a great deal of satisfaction out of overcoming some challenge which they think is very difficult for them, or which perhaps may be a little dangerous.","Good planning is important. I've also regarded a sense of humor as one of the most important things on a big expedition. When you're in a difficult or dangerous situation, or when you're depressed about the chances of success, someone who can make you laugh eases the tension.","While on top of Everest, I looked across the valley towards the great peak Makalu and mentally worked out a route about how it could be climbed. It showed me that even though I was standing on top of the world, it wasn't the end of everything. I was still looking beyond to other interesting challenges.","When you're climbing at high altitudes, life can get pretty miserable.","No one remembers who climbed Mount Everest the second time.","On the summit of Everest, I had a feeling of great satisfaction to be first there.","I have never regarded myself as a hero, but Tenzing undoubtedly was.","Human life is far more important than just getting to the top of a mountain.","Once I've decided to do something, I do usually try to carry it through to fruition.","I enjoyed climbing with other people, good friends, but I did quite a lot of solo climbing, too.","I don't regard myself as a cracking good climber. I'm just strong in the back. I have a lot of enthusiasm, and I'm good on ice.","When I was 50 years old, I actually decided to draw up a list of half a dozen things that I really hadn't done very well, and I was going to make efforts to improve. One of them was skiing, and I really did become a very much better skier.","The truth is, I'm just a rough old New Zealander who has enjoyed many challenges in his life.","I was scared many times on Everest, but this is all part of the challenge. When I fell down a crevasse, it was pretty scary.","I like to think of Everest as a great mountaineering challenge, and when you've got people just streaming up the mountain - well, many of them are just climbing it to get their name in the paper, really.","Despite all I have seen and experienced, I still get the same simple thrill out of glimpsing a tiny patch of snow in a high mountain gully and feel the same urge to climb towards it.","There is something about building up a comradeship - that I still believe is the greatest of all feats - and sharing in the dangers with your company of peers. It's the intense effort, the giving of everything you've got. It's really a very pleasant sensation.","If you cannot understand that there is something in man which responds to the challenge of this mountain and goes out to meet it, that the struggle is the struggle of life itself upward and forever upward, then you won't see why we go.","The Sherpas play a very important role in most mountaineering expeditions, and in fact many of them lead along the ridges and up to the summit.","It's not a real adventure when you have to pay for it.","I'm sure the feeling of fear, as long as you can take advantage of it and not be rendered useless by it, can make you extend yourself beyond what you would regard as your capacity. If you're afraid, the blood seems to flow freely through the veins, and you really do feel a sense of stimulation.","I think the really good mountaineer is the man with the technical ability of the professional and with the enthusiasm and freshness of approach of the amateur.","Adventuring can be for the ordinary person with ordinary qualities, such as I regard myself.","I have enjoyed great satisfaction from my climb of Everest and my trips to the poles. But there's no doubt that my most worthwhile things have been the building of schools and medical clinics.","Many people have been getting too casual about climbing Everest. I forecast a disaster many times.","Becoming a 'Sir' is slightly uncomfortable at first, although it is a considerable honor. It is amazing how quickly you become accustomed to it.","Even when you're 50, you can make the effort to improve your standards.","I think my first thought on reaching the summit- of course, I was very, very pleased to be there, naturally - but my first thought was one of a little bit of surprise. I was a little bit surprised that here I was, Ed Hillary, on top of Mt. Everest. After all, this is the ambition of most mountaineers.","I am inclined to think that the realm of mythology is where the Yeti rightly belongs.","I believe that of all the things I have done, exciting though many of them have been, there's no doubt in my mind that the most worthwhile have been the establishing of schools and hospitals, and the rebuilding of monasteries in the mountains.","I think that a good mountaineer is usually a sensible mountaineer.","I've always hated the danger part of climbing, and it's great to come down again because it's safe.","Take advantage of the years of pioneering efforts. You might find this boring, as the young want to rush head on, as it were.","Tourism is a very big economic benefit to the Sherpa people, and also, they have very strong ties to their own social attitudes and their own religion, so fortunately, they're not too influenced by many of our Western attitudes.","There is precious little in civilization to appeal to a Yeti.","Nobody climbs mountains for scientific reasons. Science is used to raise money for the expeditions, but you really climb for the hell of it.","I think Himalayan climbers tend to mature fairly late. I think most of the successful Himalayan climbers have ranged from 28 to just over 40, really.","I don't spend a lot of time thinking about dying, but I like to think that I've - if it did occur - that I would die peacefully and not make too much of a fuss about it.","I hate being called an 'icon.' I just don't like it. That's all there is to it.","I don't know if I particularly want to be remembered for anything. I personally do not think I'm a great gift to the world. I've been very fortunate.","When I was climbing, I built up a close relationship with the Sherpa people.","My most important projects have been the building and maintaining of schools and medical clinics for my dear friends in the Himalaya and helping restore their beautiful monasteries, too.","I really haven't liked the commercialization of mountaineering, particularly of Mt. Everest. By paying $65,000, you can be conducted to the summit by a couple of good guides.","I was definitely very much a country boy.","My relationship with the mountains actually started when I was 16. Every year, a group used to be taken from Auckland Grammar down to the Tangariro National Park for a skiing holiday.","My mother was a schoolteacher and very keen that I go to a city school, so although it was fairly impoverished times, I traveled every day to the Auckland Grammar School.","If I wished to do something, even if I couldn't find anyone who wanted to make the effort with me, I would go out solo climbing. I did find solo climbing very challenging and a little frightening. You knew that you were completely on your own, and you had to overcome all the problems and possible dangers.","I am a lucky man. I have had a dream and it has come true, and that is not a thing that happens often to men.","I was extremely lucky that I had two great wives. It sounds a bit funny to say that, but it's absolutely true.","I realised a little bit to my astonishment that I can give a lecture for a thousand people, and there will be this tumultuous applause, so, you know, I have the feeling well, it can't be all that bad.","I can remember when I first went into the Himalayan area way back in 1951.

But now, finance has become just as important to them as it is to us, and this is a change maybe not for the better."],"Edmund Husserl":["Experience by itself is not science.","To begin with, we put the proposition: pure phenomenology is the science of pure consciousness.","Something similar is still true of the courses followed by manifold intuitions which together make up the unity of one continuous consciousness of one and the same object.","Natural objects, for example, must be experienced before any theorizing about them can occur.","Psychologically experienced consciousness is therefore no longer pure consciousness; construed Objectively in this way, consciousness itself becomes something transcendent, becomes an event in that spatial world which appears, by virtue of consciousness, to be transcendent.","To every object there correspond an ideally closed system of truths that are true of it and, on the other hand, an ideal system of possible cognitive processes by virtue of which the object and the truths about it would be given to any cognitive subject.","Without troublesome work, no one can have any concrete, full idea of what pure mathematical research is like or of the profusion of insights that can be obtained from it.","In a few decades of reconstruction, even the mathematical natural sciences, the ancient archetypes of theoretical perfection, have changed habit completely!","In all the areas within which the spiritual life of humanity is at work, the historical epoch wherein fate has placed us is an epoch of stupendous happenings.","Within this widest concept of object, and specifically within the concept of individual object, Objects and phenomena stand in contrast with each other.","At the lowest cognitive level, they are processes of experiencing, or, to speak more generally, processes of intuiting that grasp the object in the original.","If all consciousness is subject to essential laws in a manner similar to that in which spatial reality is subject to mathematical laws, then these essential laws will be of most fertile significance in investigating facts of the conscious life of human and brute animals.","It just is nothing foreign to consciousness at all that could present itself to consciousness through the mediation of phenomena different from the liking itself; to like is intrinsically to be conscious.","Philosophers, as things now stand, are all too fond of offering criticism from on high instead of studying and understanding things from within.","Pure phenomenology claims to be the science of pure phenomena. This concept of the phenomenon, which was developed under various names as early as the eighteenth century without being clarified, is what we shall have to deal with first of all.","The actuality of all of material Nature is therefore kept out of action and that of all corporeality along with it, including the actuality of my body, the body of the cognizing subject.","The ideal of a pure phenomenology will be perfected only by answering this question; pure phenomenology is to be separated sharply from psychology at large and, specifically, from the descriptive psychology of the phenomena of consciousness.","We would be in a nasty position indeed if empirical science were the only kind of science possible.","What is thematically posited is only what is given, by pure reflection, with all its immanent essential moments absolutely as it is given to pure reflection."],"Edmund Leach":["Far from being the basis of the good society, the family, with its narrow privacy and tawdry secrets, is the source of all our discontents.","The violence in the world comes about because we human beings are forever creating barriers between men who are like us and men who are not like us.","Men do not have to cook their food; they do so for symbolic reasons to show they are men and not beasts."],"Edmund Morgan":["Thomas Paine, so celebrated and so despised as he traveled through the critical events of his time, has long appealed to biographers. Paine was present at the creation both of the United States and of the French Republic. His eloquence, in the pamphlet 'Common Sense,' propelled the American colonists toward independence.","Both European and American historians have done away with any conceptual limits on what in the past needs and deserves investigating. The result, among other things, has been a flood of works on gender history, black history, and ethnic history of all kinds.","To make a successful film from a successful play is probably much more difficult than making one from scratch, just as any carpenter will tell you that it is more difficult to restore an old house than to build a comparable new one.","The American Revolution was carried out in the name of the people, and it was supposedly 'We, the people,' who created the government that Americans still live under.","The American world had - seemingly, at least - become a Jeffersonian world by the election of 1800, which placed Thomas Jefferson in the presidency. Jefferson had been Hamilton's rival in the new government's early years, and Hamilton has figured in the public memory almost as much for that rivalry as for his positive achievements.","Few words in any language carry such a load of meaning as 'honor.' It is an old word, unchanged even in its spelling from classical Latin to modern English. Spoken or written, it does not seem to require much explanation; most people think they know what it means.","Some men look at constitutions with sanctimonious reverence and deem them like the Ark of the Covenant, too sacred to be touched. They ascribe to men of the preceding age a wisdom more than human and suppose what they did to be beyond amendment.","By 1892, enlightenment had progressed to the point where the Salem trials were simply an embarrassing blot on the history of New England. They were a part of the past that was best forgotten: a reminder of how far the human race had come in two centuries.","It was not necessary and might even have been disadvantageous for a government to claim a direct personal commission and communion of the kind God had given some rulers in the Old Testament. A working government might need the support of the Church but not of God Himself in a voice from on high.","The Puritans left behind so full a record of what they thought and did that scholars cannot resist the temptation to make the most of it.","Who would think it possible to redirect historical scholarship by explaining what Thomas Jefferson said in the Declaration of Independence?","In 1787, many Americans were convinced that the 'perpetual union' they had created in winning independence was collapsing. Six years earlier, in the Articles of Confederation, the thirteen state governments had surrendered extensive powers to a congress of delegates from each state legislature.","The men who founded and governed Massachusetts and Connecticut took themselves so seriously that they kept track of everything they did for the benefit of posterity and hoarded their papers so carefully that the whole history of the United States, recounted mainly by their descendants, has often appeared to be the history of New England writ large.","It is hard for anyone who discovers George Washington not to write about him, perhaps because he is so hard to discover and such a surprise when you do.","Washington presided at the Constitutional Convention of 1787 and is often credited with its success. But he had no known part in drafting its provisions.","Throughout his long career, Washington earned the adulation not merely of ordinary people but of the other luminaries whom we now hail as 'founding fathers.'","There is something about guns that inhibits understanding. It is not just that they can put an end to argument. They somehow generate beliefs that are obviously contrary to observable fact.","The musket could not be aimed except in a general direction; a bow in the hands of a skilled archer could regularly hit and kill an enemy completely beyond musket range.","The musket, always a muzzleloader, took minutes to reload; an archer could aim and fire up to a dozen arrows in a minute. Muskets required continual cleaning and repair; bows were quickly made and easily maintained.","In 1595, by order of the Privy Council, the English armed services abandoned the longbow and fought with muskets for the next two centuries and more. Nobody is sure why.","Liberty had many friends in the eighteenth century.","Americans, perhaps more than most people, have pondered the question of who they are and what their country is.","What was the American Revolution? The people who joined to carry it out had different views of what they had done.","No one escapes from the past without bearing some of its burdens.","Between 1776 and 1789, Americans replaced a government over them with a government under them. They have worried ever since about keeping it under. Distrust of its powers has been more common and more visible than distrust of the imperial authority of England ever was before the Revolution.","In America, we may acknowledge Washington and Lincoln as great men, and probably Franklin and Jefferson and maybe Franklin Delano Roosevelt and possibly even several more, but we would probably disagree about precisely what it was that made them great, what it was that enabled them to give a lasting direction to the course of events.","The first English settlers of North America knew they were making history. New Englanders in particular were so sure of it that they started writing their own accounts of themselves as soon as they got here.","Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence; Madison wrote not only the United States Constitution, or at least most of it, but also the most searching commentary on it that has ever appeared. Each of them served as president of the United States for eight years. What they had to say to each other has to command attention.","The men and women who occupied the east coast of North America between 1607 and 1800 have been more closely scrutinized than any other collection of people in American history.","The famous convention of 1787 met in Philadelphia to define the additional powers needed to enable Congress to do its job effectively. Instead, the convention proposed a brand new national government.","The three hundredth anniversary of the Salem witch trials of 1692 comes at a time when witchcraft commands a scholarly attention that would have been puzzling in 1892 or even in 1792.","Vox populi vox dei: the voice of the people is the voice of God. The slogan was useful for those who first attempted to substitute the people for God as the source of political authority. Their attempt was ultimately so successful that God no longer seems to be needed in government.","Franklin was the best known of the Founding Fathers. His death could not go without some sort of official notice. The House of Representatives, after listening to a brief tribute by James Madison, voted to wear badges of mourning for two months and then got on with business.","In France, where Franklin had lived from 1776 to 1785, he had won an extraordinary place in the public mind. The French had lionized him to the point of absurdity - or so at least his colleagues in the American mission thought.","Most historians don't much like generalizations. Indeed, they make a trade of showing that this or that generalization about the past will not work here or there or then.","When Landon Carter, a Virginia plantation owner, read the Declaration of Independence two days after it was issued, he wondered whether its ringing affirmation of equality meant that slaves must be freed. If so, he confided to his diary, 'You must send them out of the country, or they must steal for their support.'","The colonial period has been the proving ground in America for the new social history, which concentrates on the ordinary doings of ordinary people rather than on high culture and high politics. Unfortunately ordinary people, almost by definition, leave behind only faint traces of their existence.","The starting point for the new history, both in Europe and America, has been the record of births, marriages, and deaths, which most literate societies preserve in one form or another. In colonial America, surviving records of this kind - as of every other kind - are most abundant for New England.","The southern colonists were not preoccupied with their own historical significance and mostly did not bother even to make the records of births, marriages, and deaths that they required of themselves by law. Nor did they write accounts of what they were up to for the benefit of posterity.","The preoccupation of American historical and literary scholars with the New England Puritans must seem to outsiders like an obsession.","Apart from the intrinsic interest of the complex system of beliefs the Puritans carried with them, their lives give a clue to what it meant at the beginning to be American. And the level of scholarship dealing with them has reached a point where it can address the human condition itself.","So many able historians have worked over seventeenth-century New England that one would think there was little left to be learned from the people who lived there - fewer than 100,000 at the end of the century. Seldom, apart perhaps from the Greeks and Romans, have so few been studied by so many.","History, at its best, always tells us as much indirectly about ourselves as it does directly about our predecessors, and it is often most revealing when it deals with episodes and phenomena that we find repulsive.","The difference between eccentricity and originality in historical studies is often difficult to detect at first encounter. When a radically new interpretation of a large segment of history makes its appearance, time is needed to sift the evidence.","Cotton Mather is one of those classic figures of American history who can't be left out. One has to explain him or explain him away, redeem him or denounce him.","Cotton Mather's publications in his own lifetime amounted to more than 400 titles, and his magnum opus, on which he labored most of his life, remains unpublished: a commentary on every verse of every book of the Bible. Anyone who leaves that kind of record behind issues an irresistible invitation to historians.","Everybody knows that Alexander Hamilton was a founding father of the United States, a young father to be sure: only thirty at the time of the Constitutional Convention and just turned thirty-eight when he left behind his brilliant career as Secretary of the Treasury.","Why consider debates in the English House of Commons in 1628 along with documents on American developments in the late eighteenth century? The juxtaposition is not capricious, because the Commons during this period generated many of the ideas that were later embodied in the government of the United States.","When historians of early America turned from the pursuit of past politics, they devised a category known in the academy as 'social and intellectual history.' In it, they stuffed nearly everything except politics on the assumption, which the anthropologists assured them was correct, that it would all fit together. Somehow it did not."],"Edmund Phelps":["The 1920s and 1930s were a period of sensational productivity growth: new products were springing up all over the place, and most of those new products and new methods were developed by people who started their own companies.","Without being aware, I think I was being indoctrinated into what was called Vitalism, the idea that what makes life worth living, the good life, consists of accepting challenges, solving problems, discovery, personal growth, personal change.","Most of the big banks were shot through with short-termism, deceptive practices and self-dealing. We must institute basic changes in corporate governance and in management practice to restore responsibility and honesty for the sake of the economy and for the self-respect of the country.","Raising the minimum wage seems to all economists to, at the very least, fail to 'raise' employment, and we'd all like to see better inclusion of low-skilled workers into good-paying jobs.","The good life, as it is popularly conceived, typically involves acquiring mastery in one's work, thus gaining for oneself better terms - or means to rewards, whether material, like wealth, or nonmaterial - an experience we may call 'prospering.'","I've lived to see key parts of my research absorbed in textbooks and in central banks around the world. And some finance ministries, too.","America's peak years of indigenous innovation ran from the 1820s to the 1960s. There were a few financial panics and two depressions, to be sure. But in this period, a frenzy of creative activity, economic competition and rapid growth in national income provided widening economic inclusion, rising wages for all, and engaging careers for most.","Expertise and judgment in the art of lending for novel ventures must be reacquired.","Corporatist attitudes against capitalism came to the fore in the 1920s. Corporatists, with their conservative values, hated the invasion of towns and regions by new businesses, upsetting traditional ways, wealth and status.","I started to think about what drives innovation and what its social significance might be. The next step was to think innovators are taking a leap into the unknown. That led me to the thought that it is also a source of fun and employee engagement.","In societies where one sees a higher prevalence of 'modern values' - individualism, vitalism and self-expression - there's also higher reported job satisfaction.","Statistical studies are all over the lot about the pluses and minuses of raising the minimum wage.","A nation's economy is more than its markets, tastes, technologies and property rights.","When I was a teenager, I learned to play the trumpet. Music became my passion.","In the 1960s, and stretching back to the 1930s, it was felt by many economists that easy money is a reliable way to increase employment.","A healthy economics has got to have both conceptual, theoretical research and applied, empirical research.","'Egalitarians' who complain about inequality view the wealth of the wealthiest as bad in itself: it disfigures society. They would enact a wealth tax to extirpate the offending wealth.","When the word 'morality' comes up in connection with economics, income distribution and financial stability are usually the issues. Is it moral for rich countries to use such a high proportion of the world's resources or for investment bankers to earn large bonuses?","At the simplest level, economics can better show us the consequences of our actions. Less simple are cases in which we don't have the knowledge to predict the full consequences. Global warming and climate change are examples.","Economics has paid a terrible price for its dalliances with the Keynesian and neoclassical theories.","What brought mass innovation to a nation was not scientific advances - its own or others' - but 'economic dynamism': the desire and the space to innovate.","In America, black urban teenagers have long been lacking in inclusion. In France, there is a comparable lack of inclusion among North Africans. In much of Europe, there has been little attempt to include the Roma.","Workers in decent jobs view the economy as unjust if they or their children have virtually no chance of climbing to a higher rung in the socioeconomic ladder.","Companies like Google and Facebook may offer jobs allowing or requiring imagination and creativity, but the whole of Silicon Valley accounts for only 3 percent of national income and a smaller percentage of national employment.","As a grandson of farmers in downstate Illinois, I have long admired the dedication of farmers to their work and have written about the role of agriculture in American innovation.","If every effect of any new products or methods were required to be known before they could be produced and marketed, they would not be true innovations - and thus not represent new knowledge of what people would like, if offered.","Those of us born into vitalist and expressionist cultures must hope that governments will draw back from shutting down the modernist project of exploring, experimenting, and imagining - of voyaging into the unknown - that has been essential for rewarding lives.","I think the 19th century is an extraordinary period with a welling up of creativity and all kinds of experimentation and exploration going on at least until 1940.","My thinking has always been that the worst problem we have with regard to lack of inclusion is the terribly low labor force participation rates and terribly high unemployment rates of young men, especially young men in ethnic minority groups and, in particular, young black men.","You have little representation of young black men in the business sector, so you have children growing up in disadvantaged neighborhoods who don't hear discussions at the dinner table about what goes on in business. It's almost as if we have two nations.","For decades, my research was driven by outstanding problems in macroeconomics: mainly growth theory and employment theory.","The best part of the high school in Hastings must have been the Music Department. Its orchestra and concert band did well in county competitions, and the dance band formed by its students was the best in the region. I played lead trumpet in all of them.","I attended Amherst College from 1951 to 1955. The first two years were a revelation. There were innumerable exchanges with brilliant classmates, among them the playwright Ralph Allen, the classics scholar Robert Fagles, and the composer Michael Sahl.","When I was in college at Amherst, my father asked me a favor: to take one course in economics. I loved it - for the challenge of its mysteries.","I didn't do my work for money or prizes - only for the excitement of discovery.","It was gradually learned that acceptance of a somewhat higher inflation rate would not really bring somewhat higher employment.","I do think from time to time that conceptual questions arise: What do we mean by equilibrium? What do we mean by this concept and that concept?","A system where self-employment and self-finance was typical gave way to a system of companies having various business freedoms and enabling institutions. This was the 'great transformation' on which historians and sociologists as well as business commentators were to write volumes.","A modern economy is marked by the feasibility of endogenous change: Modernization brings myriad arrangements from expanded property rights to company law and financial institutions.","Unemployment determination in a modern economy was the main subject area of my research from the mid-1960s to the end of the 1970s and again from the mid-1980s to the early 1990s.","I could try to incorporate or reflect in my models what it is that an employee, manager, or entrepreneur does: to recognize that most are engaged in their work, form expectations and evolve beliefs, solve problems, and have ideas. Trying to put these people into economic models became my project.","In Greece, Italy and, to a lesser extent, France, unsustainable tax cuts and spending sprees added to households' estimates of their private wealth relative to their wage income.","The main cause of Europe's deep fall - the losses of inclusion, job satisfaction and wage growth - is the devastating slowdown of productivity that began in the late 1990s and struck large swaths of the continent. It holds down the growth of wages rates, and it depresses employment.","Disciples of Keynes, who focus on aggregate demand, view any increase in household wealth as raising employment because they say it adds to consumer demand.","Economists of a classical bent lay a large part of the decline of employment, and thus lagging output, to a contraction of labour supply.","After a major loss of dynamism in the 1960s, productivity growth rates began dropping in most countries, falling by half in the U.S. in the 1970s and more or less ceasing altogether in France, Germany and Britain in the late 1990s.","Developing new products is labour- intensive. So is producing the capital goods needed to make them. These jobs disappear when innovation stalls.","With less competition to fear, companies are emboldened to raise their mark-ups and profits. That lifts share prices and thus the wealth of already wealthy shareholders.","Some economists believe that the Greeks' work ethic and thrift can pull them through. But the classical virtues can do nothing to offset the dearth of innovation that plagues the economy.","The Keynesian belief that 'demand' is always at the root of underemployment and slow growth is a fallacy.","No amount of debt restructuring, even debt forgiveness, will help the Greeks achieve real prosperity. What they need is not short-term relief but, rather, a long-term cure.","There's such a preoccupation with liquidity and such an unwillingness to invest beyond the horizon of the next quarter and making sure that the CEOs hit their quarterly earnings.","When public spending in the form of transfer payments makes various services and benefits free of charge, work is discouraged. Yet it is precisely Social Security that legislators fear to cut.","I don't think the economy telegraphs very clearly where it's going.","One reason why upturns follow downturns is that downturns tend to overshoot. People get panicky, they're afraid to stay the course, so they start selling. The other thing is that I think, as entrepreneurs keep on waiting to produce new things, that there's an accumulation of as-yet-unexploited new ideas that keeps mounting up.","Things can get only so bad. People want to eat, so at some point they resist further cuts to their consumption - it's not a bottomless pit.","An economy open to new concepts and novel ventures is bound to generate unequal gains.","My view is that innovation has declined in the everyday processes that businesses tinker with incrementally as they try to become more productive over time.","Unemployment rates tend to rise and fall in roughly equal proportion at all rungs of the ladder, and that happened between 1973 and 1985.","Liberal redistributionists in favor of heavy taxation place less weight on incentive than do small-government conservatives.","Everybody feels better about himself, his community, and his country if employers are paying workers well. Economics, though, teaches that if every employer is pressured to raise wages, some labor will be priced out of the market.","The difficulties of many European countries derive from their corporatism: state projects serving cronies and vast social protection programmes, both run by elites. These surged in the 1970s and 1980s.","Italy and France could lop off their excessive wealth through a one-time tax on private wealth.","Chancellor Angela Merkel and Wolfgang Schaeuble, her finance minister, are right to oppose fiscal and bank unions without political union.","Democrats and Republicans have been very keen to make home ownership almost a national purpose.","If you rent, that's it. You don't have to pay any interest to anybody. You don't have to pay any maintenance costs to anybody. You don't have to worry about whether the boiler is going to break down. While if you own your own home, you have a hundred aggravations.","I'm old enough to remember in the 1930s and the 1940s when thrift, frugality, was considered an important virtue.","I'm hoping that the administration and other thought leaders will succeed eventually in bringing the country back to the older idea that the American dream is having a career, getting a job, and getting involved in it, and doing well. That was the core of the good life.","In countries operating a largely capitalist system, there does not appear to be a wide understanding among its actors and overseers of either its advantages or its hazards.","Capitalist systems function less well without state protection of investors, lenders, and companies against monopoly, deception, and fraud.","In essence, capitalist systems are a mechanism by which economies may generate growth in knowledge - with much uncertainty in the process, owing to the incompleteness of knowledge.","Well into the 20th century, scholars viewed economic advances as resulting from commercial innovations enabled by the discoveries of scientists - discoveries that come from outside the economy and out of the blue.","Entrepreneurs have only the murkiest picture of the future in which they are making their bets, and also there is ambiguity: they don't know when they push this lever or that lever that the outcome is going to be what they think it is going to be - there is the law of unanticipated consequences.","I just think that the Europeans are depriving themselves of a high-employment economy, and they are depriving themselves of intellectual stimulation in the workplace - and personal growth - by sticking to the stultifying, rigid system that I call corporatism.","My God, I don't know anyone who likes to accumulate their wealth more than the Europeans.","There would be plenty of justification to raise revenues in order to subsidize businesses that employ low-wage workers. But there can be no justification for pandering to the economy's entire bottom half merely to attract its votes.","To pump up consumer or government demand would force interest rates up and asset prices down, possibly by enough to destroy more jobs than are created.","The fallacy of the neoclassicals is their tenet that total employment, though hit by shocks, can be said always to be heading back to some normal level.","The need to encourage entrepreneurship and ensure that young people have the opportunity to start new businesses is acute.","Narrow banks could restart effective intermediation and ensure that consumers and employment-creating small and medium-size enterprises are adequately financed and can contribute to the reactivation of the economy.","I would like to see people dreaming of striking out on their own into some other country or their own, wherever they feel the action is, in the hope of an exciting and rewarding career.","Overpaying the banks for their toxic assets could contribute capital, but that may not be politically feasible or attractive.","To prosper and advance, the American business sector is going to need a financial system oriented toward business, not 'home ownership.'","The epic story of the West is the development in the 19th century of a mass prosperity the world had never seen and its near-disappearance in one nation after another in the 20th.","Mass prosperity came with the mass innovation that sprung up in 1815 in Britain, soon after in America, and later in Germany and France: It brought sustained growth to these nations - also to nations with entrepreneurs willing and able to copy the innovations.","An indictment of entitlements has to focus on the huge 'social wealth' that the welfare state creates at the stroke of the pen. Yet statistical tests of the effects of welfare spending on employment yield erratic results.","The level of dynamism is a matter of how fertile the country is in coming up with innovative ideas having prospects of profitability, how adept it is at identifying and nourishing the ideas with the best prospects, and how prepared it is in evaluating and trying out the new products and methods that are launched onto the market.","Germany, Italy and France appear to possess less dynamism than do the U.S. and the others.","Entrepreneurs' willingness to innovate or just to invest - and thus create new jobs - is driven by their 'animal spirits,' as they decide whether to leap into the void.","The celebration of homeownership seems to be part of a countermovement against popular owning of shares in corporations.","I'm not attacking the idea that people live in conglomerations of houses in proximity to one another, sharing the same water mains and the same newspaper delivery boy and so forth. I'm not objecting to that. That could happen with or without homeownership.","I grew up thinking that renting is perfectly normal. And then, strangely enough, I never did buy a house. I live in New York City, and I'm still renting. My own personal narrative shows that it is possible to live a respectable life without ever having owned a home.","I grew up, until age 6, in Chicago. My parents rented their apartment and, at the end of the Depression, my parents wanted to replicate that situation. So, again, we lived in a somewhat suburban setting outside of New York City, and again, they rented."],"Edmund S. Muskie":["Looking at yourself through the media is like looking at one of those rippled mirrors in an amusement park.","You have the God-given right to kick the government around - don't hesitate to do so.","In the heat of our campaigns, we have all become accustomed to a little anger and exaggeration. Yet, on the whole, our political process has served us well.","It's funny. Of all the jobs I've been ambitious for, this is one that never crossed my mind."],"Edmund Spenser":["Her angel's face, As the great eye of heaven shined bright, And made a sunshine in the shady place.","The poets' scrolls will outlive the monuments of stone. Genius survives; all else is claimed by death.","Sleep after toil, port after stormy seas, Ease after war, death after life does greatly please.","I was promised on a time - to have reason for my rhyme; From that time unto this season, I received nor rhyme nor reason.","And all for love, and nothing for reward.","It is the mind that maketh good of ill, that maketh wretch or happy, rich or poor.","He that strives to touch the starts, oft stumbles at a straw.","Gold all is not that doth golden seem.","Each goodly thing is hardest to begin.","And he that strives to touch the stars, Oft stumbles at a straw.","What more felicity can fall to creature, than to enjoy delight with liberty?"],"Edmund Waller":["Tea does our fancy aid, Repress those vapours which the head invade, And keeps that palace of the soul serene.","The lark that shuns on lofty boughs to build, Her humble nest, lies silent in the field.","Illustrious acts high raptures do infuse, And every conqueror creates a muse.","Vexed sailors cursed the rain, for which poor shepherds prayed in vain.","To love is to believe, to hope, to know; Tis an essay, a taste of Heaven below!","All human things Of dearest value hang on slender strings.","How small a part of time they share, That are so wondrous sweet and fair!","Poets lose half the praise they should have got, Could it be known what they discreetly blot.","And as pale sickness does invade, Your frailer part, the breaches made, In that fair lodging still more clear, Make the bright guest, your soul, appear.","Could we forbear dispute, and practise love, We should agree as angels do above.","Leaving the old, both worlds at once they view, That stand upon the threshold of the new.","So must the writer, whose productions should Take with the vulgar, be of vulgar mould.","Circle are praised, not that abound, In largeness, but the exactly round.","His love at once and dread instruct our thought; As man He suffer'd and as God He taught.","Others may use the ocean as their road; Only the English make it their abode.","The seas are quiet when the winds give o'er; So calm are we when passions are no more!","Give us enough but with a sparing hand.","Poets that lasting marble seek Must come in Latin or in Greek.","Go, lovely rose! Tell her that wastes her time and me That now she knows, When I resemble her to thee, How sweet and fair she seems to be.","A narrow compass! and yet there Dwelt all that 's good, and all that 's fair; Give me but what this riband bound, Take all the rest the sun goes round.","Stronger by weakness, wiser men become.","The fear of hell, or aiming to be blest, savors too much of private interest."],"Edmund White":["When I was young, I despised old people. I was provincial and narrow-minded. It's the reason I stayed stupid so long. If you only get involved with young people you don't learn anything about the world.","Europeans forget that one-third of the American people have had a personal conversation with Jesus Christ and that the born-again are not just little old ladies in black but also CEOs and provosts of universities and candidates for office.","In the middle of my sophomore year, I was sent to boarding school, at the Cranbrook School for boys, in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, where I fell in love with Marilyn Monroe. I knew that she was the most beautiful woman in the world, and yet she was in pain, in need. She was unhappy. I believed that I could help her.","The one thing that is sort of sneered at and not really believed is bisexuality. Any bisexual man is just seen as a closeted gay man. That shows how narrow-minded people are. The other thing that's totally neglected and which nobody approves of is celibacy. People again assume that you're just repressing something.","First, I was opposed to gay marriage because it seemed like one more way that gays were wanting to assimilate. When I realized the Christian right was so opposed to it, as well as tyrannical governments in Africa and Russia, I thought, 'It must be a good thing to fight for.'","Sometimes Peggy herself would sell tickets to her museum, and if tourists asked her if Mrs. Guggenheim was still alive, she'd assure them she wasn't.","New York has been the subject of thousands of books. Every immigrant group has had its saga as has every epoch and social class.","Key West is the place where your sickly house plant back in New York grows to 10 ft. It's also the place where an 8-ft. cactus, the century plant, produces a huge yellow flower every great once in a while, like a robot proffering a bouquet. After the plant flowers, it dies.","Looking back, I can see that the women I loved, at least early on, were status symbols. I suppose, in that sense, I was my mother's true disciple. She'd taught me that a good man, though elusive, could transform one's whole life once he was caught.","Biography can be the most middle-class of all forms, the judgment of little people avenging themselves on the great.","There ought to be more grants that go to people in their late twenties and early thirties. That's a crucial age, although it's very hard to judge who is worth supporting and who is not. Looking back on my own life, I see that was the period when I was closest to giving up as a novelist and when I most needed some encouragement.","In a novel, I think you have a contract with the reader to make the character representative - of a moment in history, a social class... for instance, I wanted to make the boy in 'A Boy's Own Story' more like other gay men of my generation in their youth and not like me.","The Stonewall riots were a key moment for gay people. Throughout modern history, gays had thought of themselves as something like a mental illness or maybe a sin or a crime. Gay liberation allowed us to make the leap to being a 'minority group,' which made life much easier.","In the 1970s in New York, everyone slept till noon. It was a grungy, dangerous, bankrupt city without normal services most of the time. The garbage piled up and stank during long strikes by the sanitation workers. A major blackout led to days and days of looting. The city seemed either frightening or risible to the rest of the nation.","These rejections hurt me terribly because I felt it was my life that was being rejected.","I'm an atheist, I always thought, 'This is it.' If there is going to be a heaven, it should be on earth. I feel much happier than most people. I'm fairly stoic about death, but I'm not keen on dying if it's going to be long and protracted. I don't have dark nights of the soul, except occasionally. I'm such a little busy bee.","'One Hundred Years of Solitude' is a masterpiece because it is an episodic novel that has a rigorous form - an unprecedented combination. From the very beginning we know the town of Macondo will endure only a century, so there is a limit to the length of the narrative.","My mother was terribly invasive, all in the name of psychiatric honesty. It was a bad thing in some ways, but I do think it had the effect of making me interested in 'the truth' as a writer - more than beauty, more than having a shapely story.","If you're a beach person or a golfer, Key West is not for you. Most of the sand has been imported, and the water is shallow until you've waded far out, and all the way the sea floor is covered with yucky algae and sea grass.","In a memoir, your main contract with the reader is to tell the truth, no matter how bizarre.","If bigots oppose gay marriage so vehemently, it must be because marriage is a defining institution for them; gays will never be fully accepted until they can marry and adopt, like anyone else.","In Paris, AIDS was dismissed as an American phobia until French people started dying; then everyone said, 'Well, you have to die some way or another.' If Americans were hysterical and pragmatic, the French were fatalistic: depressed but determined to keep the party going.","I do probably come down a little hard on a group of people I call the 'blue chip gays.' I mean people who have managed to become very, very famous and are still very famous partly through staying in the closet, like Jasper Johns, Cy Twombly, Susan Sontag, Harold Brodkey and others.","In his enigmatic and cunning story 'The Crown of Feathers,' Isaac Bashevis Singer refuses to produce uncontradictory evidence of God's will but rather mixes all signals, jams the evidence, stalls every conclusion.","Originally, I was against gay marriage because I was opposed to all marriage, being an old-fashioned gay bohemian. The straight people I knew in the sixties were very much opposed to it. I was, too, and it was never a possibility for gays, but when I saw how opposed the Religious Right was to it, I thought it a fight worth fighting.","I lived through the Fifties in the Midwest when everything that was happening - the repression of homosexuality, for instance, the demonization of the Left, the giggly, soporific ordinariness of adolescence, the stone-deafness to the social injustice all around us - seemed not only unobjectionable but also nonexistent.","The great triumph of the Sixties was to dramatize just how arbitrary and constructed the seeming normality of the Fifties had been. We rose up from our maple-wood twin beds and fell onto the great squishy, heated water bed of the Sixties.","Just like Barack Obama, my views on gay marriage have evolved, and now I am a reluctant groom.","As a young teenager I looked desperately for things to read that might excuse me or assure me I wasn't the only one, that might confirm an identity I was unhappily piecing together.","I didn't want to write a biographie romancee especially since I already write novels, nor did I want to challenge the rules of the biography game, arbitrary as those rules might be.","I think sincerity was my sole aesthetic and realism my experimental technique.","I think that there are empty ecological niches in the literary landscape crying to be filled and when a book more or less fills a niche it's seized on, even when it's a far from perfect fit.","If I take a less defensive tone, I'd admit that I couldn't write today a very jazzy, contemporary look at America as I did in 1979 in States of Desire.","In the case of my book, I don't think it's really the coming-out gay novel that everyone really needed, even though it was received as such. The boy is too creepy, he betrays his teacher, the only adult man with whom he's enjoyed a sexual experience, etc.","Of course the success of A Boy's Own Story took me utterly off guard.","The first version of The Beautiful Room Is Empty was the first mss. I'd ever submitted to New York editors.","Whereas fiction is a continual discovery of what one wants to say, what one feels, what one means, and is, in that sense, a performance art, biography requires different skills - research and organization.","I was too prissy, too refined, too abstemious, too French to be a good American writer.","When my lover Hubert Sorin was dying of AIDS, he was always trying to fix me up - posthumously, as it were - with the cute busboy at the hotel.","I didn't get anything published until I was thirty-three, and yet I'd written five novels and six or seven plays. The plays, I should point out, were dreadful.","I was working for Time-Life Books from 1962 to 1970, as a staff writer, and after that, I was a journalist. Eventually, I became an editor at 'The Saturday Review' and 'Horizon.'","Part of my problem as a young writer was that I was too much a New Yorker, always second-guessing the 'market.' I became so discouraged that I decided to write something that would please me alone - that became my sole criterion. And that was when I wrote 'Forgetting Elena,' the first novel I got published.","It always seemed much better to be a writer - a Real Writer - than a successful hack.","I was never an assimilationist. I always thought gays had some special mission.","The French are pretty thin-skinned. The few times I mentioned a French writer in 'City Boy,' the relatives would ring up in high dudgeon. I once wrote a mocking review of Marguerite Duras in the 'New York Review of Books,' and good friends of mine in France got very angry.","From an early age, I had the idea that writing was truth-telling. It's on the record. Everybody can see it. Maybe it goes back to the sacred origins of literature - the holy book. There's nothing holy about it for me, but it should be serious, and it should be totally transparent.","The culmination of a long struggle was 2013, which could clearly be labeled the Year of the Gay. State after state had legalized gay marriage, despite intense opposition from the religious right.","AIDS had won gays sympathy; they no longer seemed the privileged brats that the general populace had resented in the 1970s.","Why did mainstream America come to accept marriage equality? Gay leaders had made a convincing case that gay families were like straight families and should have the same rights. The American spirit of fair play had been invoked.","I asked my body if it was going to die or not from AIDS. And it said 'no.' I sort of paid attention to that.","I never liked my father. He really was a dullard and misanthrope. My mother and he were married for 22, years and it was an ill match. She encouraged me to be a writer. She opened her home to black friends, and this was the 1950s. She didn't care later when I write about her.","I've accompanied several dying people on their travels, and the desert seems to be a favored destination. It is very hot and dry and lyrical in its own way.","I always feel I'm better known in England than I am here in the U.S. Americans don't read that much, and the French are very good at knowing the names of everybody.","A straight writer can write a gay novel and not worry about it, and a gay novelist can write about straight people.","Early on, after gay liberation, there was an almost Stalinist pressure from gay critics and even gay readers to write about positive role models. We were never supposed to write negative things about gays, or else we were seen as collaborating with the enemy.","One of the side benefits of staying in the closet is you can have a much bigger career.","Everyone seems agreed that writing about sex is perilous, partly because it threatens to swamp highly individualised characters in a generic, featureless activity (much like coffee-cup dialogue, during which everyone sounds the same), and partly because it feels... tacky.","Readers of novels often fall into the bad habit of being overly exacting about the characters' moral flaws. They apply to these fictional beings standards that no one they know in real life could possibly meet.","Reading the several thousand pages of Christopher Isherwood's complete journals is an instructive corrective to the prissiness of reading fiction. Isherwood had faults that we'd say were unforgiveable in a novel (he was careful to distance himself from these in his autobiographical fiction).","Barack Obama's decision to come out in favour of gay marriage may be a historic occasion, but it is not an isolated one. His administration has been making pro-gay noises for some time; his demographic in the upcoming election is young and educated, precisely the group that favours equality for the LGBT community.","I don't have to get married myself in order to campaign on behalf of gay marriage.","I've always deplored bad heterosexual values that dictate the minute a marriage is over the former partners no longer speak to each other; only straights could be so cruel and inhuman as to reject totally the person with whom they've shared their life for 20 or 30 years.","America thrives on identity politics, left and right. But France is opposed to the idea. Since the Revolution, the French have enthroned the idea of universalism. All of us must be equal before the law as abstract individuals, and that extends to the arts.","Nobody in France would ever say 'He's a Jewish novelist' or 'She's a black novelist,' even though people do write about those subjects. It would look absurd to a French person to go into a bookstore and see a 'Gay Studies' section.","Paradoxically, since gay men rarely have gay parents, cultural transmission must come from friends or strangers (a problem since the generations so seldom mix in gay life).","The natural enmity between leaver and left is like the absolute, immediate and always shifting hostility between driver and pedestrian.","Most writers tend to get worse rather than better. I'm determined to be one that gets better.","I changed my writing style deliberately. My first two novels were written in a very self-consciously literary way. After I embraced gay subject matter, which was then new, I didn't want to stand in its way. I wanted to make the style as transparent as possible so I could get on with it and tell the story, which was inherently interesting.","'The Sound of Things Falling' may be a page turner, but it's also a deep meditation on fate and death. Even in translation, the superb quality of Vasquez's prose is evident, captured in Anne McLean's idiomatic English version. All the novel's characters are well imagined, original and rounded.","Some writers are so enthralled by ideas (one thinks of Doris Lessing) that their characters become debaters, and their fables approach allegory.","'The Truth About Lorin Jones' will undoubtedly shock and offend as many readers as it will amuse, since it dares to make fun of feminism - of its manners, if not its politics.","I can think of no other writer who so thoroughly embodies the Jamesian spirit as Alison Lurie. Like him she can excavate all the possibilities of a theme. Like his, her books seem long, unbroken threads, seamless progressions of effects.","Perhaps no other body of literature is as subject to political pressures from within the community as gay fiction.","Few writers in history have ever been 'politically correct' (a notion that rapidly changes in any case), and there's no reason to imagine that gay writers will ever suit their readers, especially since that readership is splintered into ghettos within ghettos.","Nothing lasts in New York. The life that is lived there, however, is as intense as it gets.","While writing 'City Boy,' I relied mainly on my own memories. In particular, I was able to describe the effect of gay liberation on an individual life (mine) as events paralleled my own growing self-acceptance; in this case, the political truly was the personal.","I think I'm very stoic. Death and dying are things that I'm used to.","My father was a misanthrope who slept all day and stayed up all night so that he wouldn't have to see people. He ran a business with a large staff but would go there at night and leave things for them to do during the day when he wasn't there.","I longed for literary celebrity even as I saw with my own eyes how little happiness it brought.","Paris can be like the land of the Lotus-Eaters. You can't leave.","When I was living in Paris in the '80s, I used to go out with an American model who couldn't speak French. But suddenly everyone could speak English because he was so cute.","When I was a child, I loved 'The Marble Faun' by Nathaniel Hawthorne. The reason I liked it was because it had a beautiful binding. When you're a kid, you like books because they're pretty to look at, and this one had a white calfskin cover and gold edges. That was enough to make me love it.","I used to think that I could be successful if I pretended to be a 23-year-old black woman. I wanted to find a young black woman who would be willing to go in on this with me. I would write her novels, and then she would do the touring. I always thought I was too old and the wrong color.","I've always been impelled to say the truth. When I was 14, in 1954, I already wrote a gay novel, though I'd never read one. I felt that life handed me a great subject, gay life, that had scarcely been examined, and I was impelled to record it in all its strange detail.","I've always seen writing as a way of telling the truth. For me, writing is about truth. I have always tried to be faithful to my own experience.","The talk shows in the States want celebrities, not authors. In France, it is different; writers are called upon to comment on everything. They have a very public role there.","If I had been straight, I would have been an entirely different person. I would never have turned toward writing with a burning desire to confess, to understand, to justify myself in the eyes of others... I wouldn't have been impelled to live in New York and choose the hard poverty of bohemia over the soft comfort of the business world.","It's true that Paris is made up of equal parts of social conservatism and anarchic experimentation, but foreigners never quite know where to place the moral accent mark.","I hate writing. I almost never write. I write against deadlines. And when I'm teaching, I'm focused on that.","The Internet's impact is immense. My students can't imagine ever paying for a book.","There is a whole industry in America of people who want to write, and those who teach it. Even if the students don't end up writing, what's good about them taking the courses is, they become great readers, learning to appreciate the writing.","In 'A Boy's Own Story' and 'Jack Holmes and His Friend,' my idea was to take someone totally different from my real self and, at the same time, to assign to him my own life trajectory.","Women and gay men have something in common after all: in that they are trying to deal with this goofy egotistical monster called a man.","I can remember in the late 1980s and early 1990s how many men with AIDS I saw everywhere in Key West. There were hospices and medical supply stores geared to people with AIDS. It seemed that every sick man who could afford it had headed for the warmth and the tranquillity and the gay-friendliness of the island.","My father was a sort of John Wayne Texan who'd worked as a cowboy when he was young. He'd participated in rattlesnake round-ups and swum with copperheads.","Since, in the best Southern tradition, I was named Edmund Valentine White III, sometimes when people look up my books on Amazon they find 'Chocolate Drops from the South' by my grandfather.","There are a lot of historical novelists who do the research about the clothes and maybe even the eating utensils, but they're basically taking modern people and putting them in old drag - it's sort of the 'Gone With the Wind' approach.","I'm not such a fan of imagination. If you're alive to details, they oftentimes suggest a richer or deeper imaginative line than you would have imagined.","I was always ambitious - not to make money: to be published.","When I was in college, I was always saying I was a socialist.","Fiction is the thing I esteem most in my own work; I feel that, even if it's no good, only I could have written those books.","I think I could be a cook. Everybody always says I'm good, though I think it's quite gruelling as a profession.","Originally I was opposed to gay assimilation and targeted gay marriage as just another effort on the part of gays to resemble their straight neighbours.","When a woman falls in love with me, I feel guilty. I am convinced that it's pure obstinacy that keeps me from reciprocating her passion. As I explain to her that I'm gay, it sounds, even to me, like a silly excuse; I scarcely believe it myself.","I suppose people hadn't really thought each decade should have its own character and be different from the others till the 1920s, although I remember in a nineteenth-century Russian novel someone remarked that a character was a typical man of the 1830s - progressive and an atheist.","In retrospect, we could see that the 1950s had been a reactionary period in America of Eisenhower blandness, of virulent anticommunism, of the 'Feminine Mystique.'"],"Edmund Wilson":["There is nothing more demoralizing than a small but adequate income.","Marxism is the opium of the intellectuals.","If I could only remember that the days were, not bricks to be laid row on row, to be built into a solid house, where one might dwell in safety and peace, but only food for the fires of the heart.","No two persons ever read the same book.","I am not quite a poet but I am something of the kind.","All Hollywood corrupts; and absolute Hollywood corrupts absolutely.","Real genius of moral insight is a motor which will start any engine.","The human imagination has already come to conceive the possibility of recreating human society.","His style has the desperate jauntiness of an orchestra fiddling away for dear life on a sinking ship.","The product of the scientific imagination is a new vision of relations - like that of artistic imagination."],"Edna Ferber":["Christmas isn't a season. It's a feeling.","Roast beef, medium, is not only a food. It is a philosophy.","Living the past is a dull and lonely business; looking back strains the neck muscles, causing you to bump into people not going your way.","Perhaps too much of everything is as bad as too little.","Big doesn't necessarily mean better. Sunflowers aren't better than violets.","Writers should be read but not seen. Rarely are they a winsome sight.","It's terrible to realize you don't learn how to live until you're ready to die, and then it's too late.","A woman can look both moral and exciting... if she also looks as if it was quite a struggle.","Life can't defeat a writer who is in love with writing, for life itself is a writer's lover until death.","Being an old maid is like death by drowning, a really delightful sensation after you cease to struggle.","A closed mind is a dying mind.","If American politics are too dirty for women to take part in, there's something wrong with American politics.","Any garment which is cut to fit you is much more becoming, even if it is not so splendid as a garment which has been cut to fit somebody not of your stature.","A stricken tree, a living thing, so beautiful, so dignified, so admirable in its potential longevity, is, next to man, perhaps the most touching of wounded objects."],"Edna O'Brien":["Recollection is not something that I can summon up, it simply comes and I am the servant of it.","The vote means nothing to women. We should be armed.","I am obsessive, also I am industrious. Besides, the time when you are most alive and most aware is in childhood and one is trying to recapture that heightened awareness.","My hand does the work and I don't have to think; in fact, were I to think, it would stop the flow. It's like a dam in the brain that bursts.","Writing is like carrying a fetus.","Writers really live in the mind and in hotels of the soul.","I have some women friends but I prefer men. Don't trust women. There is a built-in competition between women.","I'm an Irish Catholic and I have a long iceberg of guilt.","In every question and every remark tossed back and forth between lovers who have not played out the last fugue, there is one question and it is this: 'Is there someone new?'","Countries are either mothers or fathers, and engender the emotional bristle secretly reserved for either sire."],"Edna St. Vincent Millay":["My god is all gods in one. When I see a beautiful sunset, I worship the god of Nature; when I see a hidden action brought to light, I worship the god of Truth; when I see a bad man punished and a good man go free, I worship the god of Justice; when I see a penitent forgiven, I worship the god of Mercy.","My candle burns at both ends; it will not last the night; but ah, my foes, and oh, my friends - it gives a lovely light!","Where you used to be, there is a hole in the world, which I find myself constantly walking around in the daytime, and falling in at night. I miss you like hell.","God, I can push the grass apart and lay my finger on Thy heart.","I am glad that I paid so little attention to good advice; had I abided by it I might have been saved from some of my most valuable mistakes.","The soul can split the sky in two and let the face of God shine through.","A person who publishes a book willfully appears before the populace with his pants down. If it is a good book nothing can hurt him. If it is a bad book nothing can help him.","Not truth, but faith, it is that keeps the world alive.","Some of us have been thinking and talking too long without doing anything. Poems are perfect; picketing, sometimes, is better.","What the customer demands is last year's model, cheaper. To find out what the customer needs you have to understand what the customer is doing as well as he understands it. Then you build what he needs and you educate him to the fact that he needs it.","Please give me some good advice in your next letter. I promise not to follow it.","We are all ruled in what we do by impulses; and these impulses are so organized that our actions in general serve for our self preservation and that of the race.","Set the foot down with distrust on the crust of the world - it is thin.","I've written so many verses and keep on writing so many more that I became afraid that if I didn't write them into one big book, I might forget some of them.","Childhood is the kingdom where nobody dies. Nobody that matters, that is.","Beauty is whatever gives joy.","I see things with my own eyes, just as if they were the first eyes that ever saw, and then I set about to tell, as best I can, just what I've seen.","The longest absence is less perilous to love than the terrible trials of incessant proximity.","Parrots, tortoises and redwoods live a longer life than men do; Men a longer life than dogs do; Dogs a longer life than love does.","It's not true that life is one damn thing after another; it's one damn thing over and over.","Music my rampart, and my only one.","I went to Boston fully expecting to be arrested - arrested by a polizia created by a government that my ancestors rebelled to establish.","It is high time we found out about this man Cummings. Let us give him every opportunity to show us at once whether he is a genius, a charlatan, or a congenital defective - and get him off our minds.","The young are so old, they are born with their fingers crossed.","I'm so tired of hearing about 'Renascence,' I'm nearly dead. I find it's as hard to live down an early triumph as an early indiscretion."],"Ednita Nazario":["I come from that society and there is a common thread, specifically family values - the idea that you do anything for your family, and the unconditional love for one's children.","Latin music has many international influences - pop, rock, country, Brazilian sounds, and alternative styles.","The fact is, Latinos now own their own lives and I believe they can afford to look back without judgment.","To begin with, I don't have any stage fright.","And, more important, none of Paul's music feels unfamiliar to me.","In America, music is more tightly categorized.","The Latin musical tradition is very rich and gives the singer a lot of freedom to explore a range of.","The voice has to be very clear at all times in order to convey the emotion.","I am a woman of the 21st Century who is self-assured and speaks my mind.","The process is intense and the producers, who are intelligent men, are bringing in new people for a fresh look at a complicated project that has been in the making for 10 years.","I had never auditioned for Broadway - any play - and I was not familiar with what you're supposed to do.","It's fascinating to be in a place where no one has ever heard of me.","I have to trust what I do and then do it."],"Edoardo Ponti":["Elegance is very dangerous. It's like TNT. A little goes a long way.","My parents could not be more Italian.","What would you do in order to marry Sophia Loren? I think anyone would become French to marry Sophia Loren.

He therefore approaches his task with full humility, and avoids clever tricks like the plague.","Why has elegance found so little following? That is the reality of it. Elegance has the disadvantage, if that's what it is, that hard work is needed to achieve it and a good education to appreciate it.","It is practically impossible to teach good programming to students that have had a prior exposure to BASIC: as potential programmers they are mentally mutilated beyond hope of regeneration.","The use of COBOL cripples the mind; its teaching should, therefore, be regarded as a criminal offense.","Mathematicians are like managers - they want improvement without change.","APL is a mistake, carried through to perfection. It is the language of the future for the programming techniques of the past: it creates a new generation of coding bums.","The lurking suspicion that something could be simplified is the world's richest source of rewarding challenges.","Teaching to unsuspecting youngsters the effective use of formal methods is one of the joys of life because it is so extremely rewarding.","The traditional mathematician recognizes and appreciates mathematical elegance when he sees it. I propose to go one step further, and to consider elegance an essential ingredient of mathematics: if it is clumsy, it is not mathematics.","The students that, like the wild animal being prepared for its tricks in the circus called 'life', expects only training as sketched above, will be severely disappointed: by his standards he will learn next to nothing.","Many mathematicians derive part of their self-esteem by feeling themselves the proud heirs of a long tradition of rational thinking; I am afraid they idealize their cultural ancestors.","About the use of language: it is impossible to sharpen a pencil with a blunt axe. It is equally vain to try to do it with ten blunt axes instead.","If 10 years from now, when you are doing something quick and dirty, you suddenly visualize that I am looking over your shoulders and say to yourself: 'Dijkstra would not have liked this', well that would be enough immortality for me.","Don't compete with me: firstly, I have more experience, and secondly, I have chosen the weapons.","I mentioned the non-competitive spirit explicitly, because these days, excellence is a fashionable concept.

Germany is determined to provide substantial help. So are the Netherlands and other states. But a day will come when we have to count on our own resources.","They're making a song and dance because that serves their immediate interests. But what will happen tomorrow? They will have to pay salaries and pensions.","To sum up, what has been our policy? We looked for and found friends all throughout the world.","When I came back to power, Georgia was completely isolated on the international stage.","Now, the entire world community recognizes Georgia. We are members of the United Nations and the Council of Europe. Everything is being prepared so that we will soon enter the European Union.","We also have a real opportunity to join NATO.","Prospects of normalizing our relations with Russia look good.","The external world is committed to helping Georgia settle its problems.","But we cannot rely on foreign help indefinitely.","No Georgian has the right to evade or neglect his duties and responsibilities.","Germany is determined to provide substantial help. So are the Netherlands and other states. But a day will come when we have to count on our own resources.","I am not responsible for the actions of Saakashvili and even for those of Gamsakhurdia.","As for myself, I was never against Russia.","I was a member of the Politburo for seven years, a foreign minister."],"Eduardo Bhatia":["Broadband, wireless, and technology services have become a vibrant sector of our national economy with the potential to both empower and invest in our communities.","We have over 30 dams in Puerto Rico, and I think only one works. We're here in the rain forest, and we have plenty of water. It's insane.","The majority of Puerto Ricans in Florida and New York are Democrats, but nonetheless, we have Republican governors.","As Chair of the Broadband and Technology Task Force, I will strive to ensure that legislative and regulatory policy making on these rapidly evolving services takes fully into account the needs of the Latino community.","No retirement system in the world is as broken as ours.","People who hand over democracy in exchange for economic security end up losing both things.","In the 21st century, government efforts should focus on 'multiculturalism', including the diversity of languages.","There is nothing more fundamental for public workers to know if they are going to be partly laid off.","I don't have a problem with a board that advises, that supervises, one with which we can have a discussion. But we will never accept a board that has control over Puerto Rico's affairs.","In Puerto Rico, there has developed a culture of taking out loans and not paying them back. That has ended.","It is unbelievable that the federal court itself ignores that rights guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution apply in Puerto Rico.","From the streets of Los Angeles to the public schools of the Bronx, there is no state of the Union where Latinos are not becoming local leaders and responsible politicians."],"Eduardo Chillida":["To look is one thing, to see is another thing; to see is very difficult, normally; to look is to try to see. I have looked and I hope I have seen.","Whatever I know how to do, I've already done. Therefore I must always do what I do not know how to do.","Art is that which comes to a man, and stands between himself and an implacable witness: the work.","One can never know enough. The unknown and its call lies even in what we know.","The hand has the richest articulation of space.","Boundaries are actually the main factor in space, just as the present, another boundary, is the main factor in time.","What comes from oneself, is nearly from no one. There is only me as a link.","In my work, I have never had any use for anything that I have known in advance.","Nobody can teach what is inside a person; it has to be discovered for oneself and a way must be found to express it."],"Eduardo Galeano":["History never really says goodbye. History says, 'See you later.'","We are all mortal until the first kiss and the second glass of wine.","We have a memory cut in pieces. And I write trying to recover our real memory, the memory of humankind, what I call the human rainbow, which is much more colorful and beautiful than the other one, the other rainbow.","The purpose of torture is not getting information. It's spreading fear.","Most of wars or military coups or invasions are done in the name of democracy against democracy.","Less is always more. The best language is silence. We live in a time of a terrible inflation of words, and it is worse than the inflation of money.","Each day has a story to - deserves to be told, because we are made of stories. I mean, scientists say that human beings are made of atoms, but a little bird told me that we are also made of stories.","Every two weeks, a language dies. The world is diminished when it loses its human sayings, just as when it loses its diversity of plants and beasts.","The walls are the publishers of the poor.","Even though professional soccer has become more about business and less about the game itself, I still believe football is a party for the legs that play it and for the eyes that watch it.","I'm attracted to soccer's capacity for beauty. When well played, the game is a dance with a ball.","The world is becoming an immense military base, and that base is becoming a mental hospital the size of the world. Inside the nuthouse, which ones are crazy?","In 1492, the natives discovered they were Indians; they discovered they lived in America.","Almost all wars, perhaps all, are trade wars connected with some material interest. They are always disguised as sacred wars, made in the name of God, or civilization or progress. But all of them, or almost all of the wars, have been trade wars.","If nature were a bank, they would have already rescued it.","Each time a new war is disclosed in the name of the fight of the good against evil, those who are killed are all poor. It's always the same story repeating once and again and again.","The fiesta of soccer, a feast for the legs that play and the eyes that watch, is much more than a big business run by overlords from Switzerland. The most popular sport in the world wants to serve the people who embrace it.","In the Age of the Almighty Computer, drones are the perfect warriors. They kill without remorse, obey without kidding around, and they never reveal the names of their masters.","I think the purpose of the writer is to help us see. The writer is someone who can perhaps have the joy of helping others see.","The diversity of life is so stimulating for me.","My language is a feel-thinking language, feeling and thinking at once, that is why it is a celebration of life, and at once it is a denunciation of everything that is not allowed in life to be real life, it's plenitude.","So many stories, and to choose which ones to tell and how to tell them. The words, they will tap me on the shoulder and they will speak to me: 'Tell me! Tell me!' The stories choose me.","Indignation must always be the answer to indignity. Reality is not destiny.","The history of soccer is a sad voyage from beauty to duty. When the sport became an industry, the beauty that blossoms from the joy of play got torn out by its very roots.","Richness in the world is a result of other people's poverty. We should begin to shorten the abyss between haves and have-nots.","Here in the United States, corporations has human rights. And then why not - why not nature also, if corporations can defend themselves, saying, 'We have human rights?' Well, let's admit that nature also should be protected.","I am grateful to journalism for waking me up to the realities of the world.","This work is a torture on the rump but a joy to the heart.","Always in all my books I'm trying to reveal or help to reveal the hidden greatness of the small, of the little, of the unknown - and the pettiness of the big.","Writing is a marvelous adventure and very labor-intensive: those words run away and try to escape. They are very difficult to capture.","I remember that - you know, I didn't receive a formal education. I was educated in the Montevideo cafe, in the cafes of Montevideo. There, I received my first lessons in the art of telling stories, storytelling.","The human murder by poverty in Latin America is secret. Every year, without making a sound, three Hiroshima bombs explode over communities that have become accustomed to suffering with clenched teeth.","From 8 A.M. until noon, I am pessimistic. Then from 1 P.M. until 4, I feel optimistic.","I go about the world, hand outstretched, and in the stadiums I plead, 'A pretty move, for the love of God.' And when good football happens, I give thanks for the miracle, and I don't give a damn which team or country performs it.","From their castle in Zurich, the owners of soccer do not propose, they impose. That's their way.","The manager believes soccer is a science and the field a laboratory, but the genius of Einstein and the subtlety of Freud is not enough for the owners and the fans. They want a miracle worker like Our Lady of Lourdes, with the stamina of Gandhi.","We Latins are known for jabbering on.","I am astonished each time I come to the U.S. by the ignorance of a high percentage of the population, which knows almost nothing about Latin America or about the world. It's quite blind and deaf to anything that may happen outside the frontiers of the U.S.","I am quite prehistoric, absolutely prehistoric.","Reality is very, very contradictory, and so I try to write just perfecting what I see, what I read, what I feel, in a feel-thinking way. Not only giving ideas, or receiving ideas, or trying to explain something, but mainly feel-thinking, a feel-thinking language able to tie the heart and the mind, which have been divorced.","When a book is alive, really alive, you feel it. You put it to your ear here, and you feel it breathe, sometimes laugh, sometimes cry, just like a person, a little person.","The division of labor among nations is that some specialize in winning and others in losing.","There is a tradition that sees journalism as the dark side of literature, with book writing at its zenith. I don't agree. I think that all written work constitutes literature, even graffiti.","The world is organised by the war economy and the war culture.","It's a difficult competition against silence, because silence is a perfect language, the only language which says with no words.","What is the most popular scene in the Bible? Adam and Eve biting the apple. It's not there.","Disasters are called natural, as if nature were the executioner and not the victim.","A lot of leftists think it is soccer's fault that people don't think, while most rightists are convinced that soccer is a proof that people think with their feet.","I wanted to be a soccer player, and I became the best of the best, the number one, better than Maradona, better than Pele, and even better than Messi - but only at night, nighttime, during my dreams. When I wake up, I realized that I have wooden legs and that I'm doomed to be a writer.","There are some writers who feel they are elected by God. I am not. I am elected by the devil - this is clear.","I'm a writer obsessed with remembering: with remembering the past of America above all - and above all, that of Latin America, intimate land condemned to forgetfulness.","The more the technocrats programme it down to the smallest detail, the more the powerful manipulate it, football continues to be the art of the unforeseeable. When you least expect it, the impossible occurs: the dwarf teaches the giant a lesson, and a scraggy, bow-legged black man makes an athlete sculpted in Greece look ridiculous.","The technocracy of professional sport has managed to impose a soccer of lightning speed and brute strength: a soccer that negates joy, kills fantasy and outlaws daring."],"Eduardo Paes":["Globalization has produced a new of level of interdependence among us. The economy and multinational supply chains do not abide by political boundaries. A computer ordered in Brazil is designed in California and assembled in several other countries. Economic integration was the first strong evidence of a new era.","Rio is an energetic, vibrant place, full of beauty and nature. But we face the kinds of problems any developing metropolis does - with pollution, traffic congestion, poverty. Distribution of green areas, for example, is not uniform. Madureira, the heart of the suburb in Rio, is a concrete jungle.","Hosting the Olympic Games of course guarantees the world's attention, but there is more to it than simply bathing in the global spotlight. Most importantly, host cities can use the opportunity to create a positive and lasting legacy, resulting in both tangible and intangible returns to local communities.","In Rio, 1.4 million of the 6.3 million people live in favelas, or slums. They are all over the city, but favelas are not always a problem - sometimes they can be a solution, if you have the right public policies.","There is no time and space limitation for public accountability on the Internet. Creative commonality is standard and does not resemble the authoritarian style of the dead communist experience. It seems that it is no longer society's obligation to understand legislation; it is a duty for governments to be understood by their people.","There is no time and space in the digital world. People chat and collaborate through social networks. Cultural icons garner millions of fans online in locations they have often never been themselves. The boundary between public and private life is now everyone's business.","Every time you think of a city, you have to think green, green, green. Every time you see concrete jungle, you must find open spaces. And when you find open spaces, make it so people can get to them.","I strongly believe being mayor is the public post in which you have the greatest opportunity to change peoples' lives for the better. People live in cities, not states or nations. As a mayor, you are connected directly to citizens.","Rio's a beautiful city, a vibrant place, special place.","I really do believe that mayors have the political position to really change people's lives.","Smart cities are those who manage their resources efficiently. Traffic, public services and disaster response should be operated intelligently in order to minimize costs, reduce carbon emissions and increase performance.","By 2050, seven out of ten people will live in cities, which will account for six billion people living in urban areas. That phenomenon is central to all the challenges humanity faces. If there is an issue to be addressed, then it is certainly happening in cities and therefore must be considered on an urban scale.","The city of the future is a city that cares about its citizens and integrates its citizens.","It's a difficult task to deal with cities. But with some original ways of getting things done, with some basic commandments, you can really get cities to be a great, great place to live.","You cannot deal with a city if it's not socially integrated.","Don't ever in your life do a World Cup and the Olympic Games at the same time. This will make your life almost impossible.","I don't want to compare my city to Zurich; thank God we're not that boring. Rio is advancing fast, but we're at a different phase in our civilization.","Civil movements and riots are as old as human civilization. Long before Twitter was created, mobilization of the discontented was mouth-to-mouth, or even by 'smoke signals' to gather the uprising against established political power.","Google is omniscient of what people search for and do. Facebook has over a billion subscribers, meaning Mark Zuckerberg has personal information about one in every seven people on Earth. U.S.A., Brazil, Mexico, India and Indonesia are at the top of that list.","President Obama is the best-known politician to be exploring the possibilities of new technologies to converse with the people. Others must follow his lead and innovate. It is inevitable.","Rio will have to look after the legacy of infrastructure. But it's unclear who will run the sports centres after the Olympics.","Elected representatives are so embedded in the basic notion of what constitutes a democratic nation that it has become indistinguishable from any other form of democratic governance.","The digital revolution has deepened the crisis within representative democracy. But as it forces its demise, it might also dictate its future. Traditional representative democracy within nations is no longer enough. People want more participation and collaboration with their government.","What we are witnessing is the birth of something I call 'Polisdigitocracy.' This is a form of government that counts participation and transparency as its cornerstones and uses technology as its guide. The digital revolution is allowing democracy to recall its foundations and evolution is modernizing and reinforcing our fundamental values.","When Seoul hosted the Games in 1988, it became a symbol of the Asian Tigers' ascent onto the world stage. In 1992, the Barcelona Olympics represented the unification of Europe. And when Rio plays host in 2016, it will reinforce the growing importance of Brazil and Latin America as a whole.","Political movements and mega sporting events have always gone hand in hand. In 1980, there were Cold War boycotts in Moscow and again in 1984 during Los Angeles Games.","I have the best job in the world. I wake up every morning energized at the thought of running Rio de Janeiro, the most exciting city on the planet.","In Rio we built a Center of Operations, a situation room that gathers information from municipal departments and allows us to manage and help decision-making. I can check the weather, the traffic and the location of city's waste collection trucks. Each of 4,000 buses in the city has a camera connected to the situation room."],"Eduardo Saverin":["I do have a Bentley. I do go out.","For charity purposes, how do I help? A lot of prospective levers and tools have come into my life.","I am obligated and I will pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes to the American government. I already paid and I will keep paying whatever taxes I owe based on my time as a U.S. citizen.","I am investing like a crazy person, mostly in internet start-ups. And I want to invest in Brazil as well, because I am Brazilian and that's in my heart.","I don't like showing my privacy online.","Facebook wasn't built out of a Harvard dorm window.","People always try to put a title or a symbol on you. If you work in a bank, you are a banker. For me, they see a co-founder of Facebook."],"Edvard Grieg":["Artists like Bach and Beethoven erected churches and temples on the heights. I only wanted... to build dwellings for men in which they might feel happy and at home.","Suddenly a mist fell from my eyes and I knew the way I had to take."],"Edvard Moser":["It was quite difficult to find a place to do what we wanted, namely to study the neurological basis of behaviour and especially learning and memory, which we were particularly interested in.","Most couples manage to cooperate on child raising - for us, our brain project is our third child, so nothing different, really."],"Edvard Munch":["The colors live a remarkable life of their own after they have been applied to the canvas.","Sickness, insanity and death were the angels that surrounded my cradle and they have followed me throughout my life.","For as long as I can remember I have suffered from a deep feeling of anxiety which I have tried to express in my art.","Death is pitch-dark, but colors are light. To be a painter, one must work with rays of light.","Nature is not only all that is visible to the eye... it also includes the inner pictures of the soul.","From my rotting body, flowers shall grow and I am in them and that is eternity.","A person himself believes that all the other portraits are good likenesses except the one of himself.","I have no fear of photography as long as it cannot be used in heaven and in hell.","Some colors reconcile themselves to one another, others just clash.","Disease, insanity, and death were the angels that attended my cradle, and since then have followed me throughout my life.","Painting picture by picture, I followed the impressions my eye took in at heightened moments. I painted only memories, adding nothing, no details that I did not see. Hence the simplicity of the paintings, their emptiness.","No longer shall I paint interiors with men reading and women knitting. I will paint living people who breathe and feel and suffer and love.","Without anxiety and illness I should have been like a ship without a rudder.","I painted the picture, and in the colors the rhythm of the music quivers. I painted the colors I saw.","The rich man who gives, steals twice over. First he steals the money and then the hearts of men.","In common with Michelangelo and Rembrandt I am more interested in the line, its rise and fall, than in color.","In my childhood I always felt that I was treated unjustly, without a mother, sick, and with the threat of punishment in Hell hanging over my head.","One can easily tell that the creator of the paintings in the Sistine Chapel was above all a sculptor.","Oil-painting is a developed technique. Why go backwards?","I learned early about the misery and dangers of life, and about the afterlife, about the external punishment which awaited the children of sin in Hell.","This kind of painting with its large frames is a bourgeois drawing-room art. It is an art dealer's art-and that came in after the civil wars following the French Revolution.","I build a kind of wall between myself and t he model so that I can paint in peace behind it. Otherwise, she might say something that confuses and distracts me.","The notes I have made are not a diary in the ordinary sense, but partly lengthy records of my spiritual experiences, and partly poems in prose.","I find it difficult to imagine an afterlife, such as Christians, or at any rate many religious people, conceive it, believing that the conversations with relatives and friends interrupted here on earth will be continued in the hereafter.","I should have considered it wrong to have finished the Frieze before the room for its accommodation and the funds for its completion were available.","Youth must go ahead and prosper. These young painters are all very talented people, but they all paint frescoes.","When I paint a person, his enemies always find the portrait a good likeness.","To die is as if one's eyes had been put out and one cannot see anything any more. Perhaps it is like being shut in a cellar. One is abandoned by all. They have slammed the door and are gone. One does not see anything and notices only the damp smell of putrefaction.","It was always my intention that The Frieze should be housed in a room which would provide a suitable architectural frame for it.","By painting colors and lines and forms seen in quickened mood I was seeking to make this mood vibrate as a phonograph does. This was the origin of the paintings in The Frieze of Life."],"Edward Abbey":["May your trails be crooked, winding, lonesome, dangerous, leading to the most amazing view. May your mountains rise into and above the clouds.","Wilderness is not a luxury but a necessity of the human spirit.","When a man's best friend is his dog, that dog has a problem.","A patriot must always be ready to defend his country against his government.","One man alone can be pretty dumb sometimes, but for real bona fide stupidity, there ain't nothin' can beat teamwork.","There is science, logic, reason; there is thought verified by experience. And then there is California.","The idea of wilderness needs no defense, it only needs defenders.","A drink a day keeps the shrink away.","You can't study the darkness by flooding it with light.","Anarchism is founded on the observation that since few men are wise enough to rule themselves, even fewer are wise enough to rule others.","Climbing K2 or floating the Grand Canyon in an inner tube; there are some things one would rather have done than do.","Civilization is a youth with a molotov cocktail in his hand. Culture is the Soviet tank or L.A. cop that guns him down.","Power is always dangerous. Power attracts the worst and corrupts the best.","Our culture runs on coffee and gasoline, the first often tasting like the second.","Belief in the supernatural reflects a failure of the imagination.","That which today calls itself science gives us more and more information, and indigestible glut of information, and less and less understanding.","For myself I hold no preferences among flowers, so long as they are wild, free, spontaneous. Bricks to all greenhouses! Black thumb and cutworm to the potted plant!","Society is like a stew. If you don't stir it up every once in a while then a layer of scum floats to the top.","Growth for the sake of growth is the ideology of the cancer cell.","Love implies anger. The man who is angered by nothing cares about nothing.","The tragedy of modern war is that the young men die fighting each other - instead of their real enemies back home in the capitals.","Our 'neoconservatives' are neither new nor conservative, but old as Bablyon and evil as Hell.","Say what you like about my bloody murderous government,' I says, 'but don't insult me poor bleedin' country.","What is the purpose of the giant sequoia tree? The purpose of the giant sequoia tree is to provide shade for the tiny titmouse.","Taxation: how the sheep are shorn.","The missionaries go forth to Christianize the savages - as if the savages weren't dangerous enough already.","Grown men do not need leaders.","If the end does not justify the means - what can?"],"Edward Albee":["The avant-garde theater is fun; it is free-swinging, bold, iconoclastic, and often wildly, wildly funny. If you will approach it with childlike innocence - putting your standard responses aside, for they do not apply - if you will approach it on its own terms, I think you will be in for a liberating surprise.","He that has been bitten by a snake is afraid of a rope.","Good writers define reality; bad ones merely restate it. A good writer turns fact into truth; a bad writer will, more often than not, accomplish the opposite.","I'm not suggesting that the play is without fault; all of my plays are imperfect, I'm rather happy to say-it leaves me something to do.","A play is fiction - and fiction is fact distilled into truth.","Sometimes a person has to go a very long distance out of his way to come back a short distance correctly.","It's a good idea to have friends both in Heaven and in Hell.","Old people whimper, and cry, and belch, and make great hollow rumbling sounds at table; old people wake up in the middle of the night screaming, and find out they haven't even been asleep; and when old people are asleep, they try to wake up, and they can't... not for the longest time.","The thing that makes a creative person is to be creative and that is all there is to it.","I am convinced that no one is fully educated without a full grounding in the arts.","What people really want in the theater is fantasy involvement and not reality involvement.","I swear, if you existed I'd divorce you.","Never marry for money; you can borrow it cheaper.","Careers are funny things. They begin mysteriously and, just as mysteriously, they can end; and I am at just the very beginning of what I hope will be a long and satisfying life in the theater. But, whatever happens, I am grateful to have had my novice work received so well, and so quickly.","American critics are like American universities. They both have dull and half-dead faculties.","Your source material is the people you know, not those you don't know, but every character is an extension of the author's own personality.","Remember one thing about democracy. We can have anything we want and at the same time, we always end up with exactly what we deserve.","I have a fine sense of the ridiculous, but no sense of humor.","One must let the play happen to one; one must let the mind loose to respond as it will, to receive impressions, to sense rather than know, to gather rather than immediately understand.","You gotta have swine to show you where the truffles are.","If Attila the Hun were alive today, he'd be a drama critic.","The difference between critics and audiences is that one is a group of humans and one is not.","My exposure to Beckett and to late O'Neill was probably important right at the time I gave up poetry and the novel.","That's all that counts. People being sorry. Makes you feel better; gives you a sense of dignity, and that's all that's important; a sense of dignity. And it doesn't matter if you don't care or not, either. You got to have a sense of dignity, even if you don't care, 'cause, if you don't have that, civilization's doomed."],"Edward Albert":["Sometimes you have to be selfish to be selfless.","The simple act of caring is heroic.","Some days it is a heroic act just to refuse the paralysis of fear and straighten up and step into another day.","Fear is the only true enemy, born of ignorance and the parent of anger and hate.","In times of life crisis, whether wild fires or smoldering stress, the first thing I do is go back to basics... am I eating right, am I getting enough sleep, am I getting some physical and mental exercise everyday.","In 1969, at the age of 19, I was lucky enough to work with George C. Scott in the definitive portrayal of his career over a period of many months and several countries on the definitive film version of Patton's WWII career.","Let us begin by doing our best to do our best, every single time, no matter what, forever.","Courage is just fear, plus prayers, plus understanding.","On a level of simple personal survival, understanding and forgiveness are crucial... whether in an intimate personal relationship or on a global level.","I always knew I would act.

Nothing more than the patching up of those attacked and the burying of those who are slain, without a thought being given to the real strong hold.","Disease is, in essence, the result of conflict between soul and mind, and will never be eradicated except by spiritual and mental effort.","In our western civilization we have the glorious example, the great standard of perfection and the teachings of the Christ to guide us. He acts for us as Mediator between our personality and our Soul.","Rest assured that whatever station of life we are placed, princely or lowly, it contains the lessons and experiences necessary at the moment for our evolution, and gives us the best advantage for the development of ourselves."],"Edward Ball":["The topic of slavery is like an electric fence. Touch it and people will react.","There are, after all, between seventy-five thousand and a hundred thousand descendants of the Ball-family slaves. If I were to begin apologizing to every one of these families, it would quickly become a meaningless act.","If you read the memoirs of slave-owning families, you'd be hard pressed to find evidence of black people in the lives of the whites, even though for most of the time on the plantations black people outnumbered whites by a ratio of seven to one.","Before the American Revolution there were frequent slave uprisings, and a lot of people would run away.","All of us in the Ball family in South Carolina, from the time we're children, hear stories about our ancestors, the slave owners.","It's not a common thing for a Southern white family to go out and seek their black cousins.","Slavery in West Africa, and in Rome and in the Mediterranean, was something different than slavery in America.","There was a uniqueness to the American case of slavery. 10 million people, a conservative estimate, were brought to America... hundreds of people were set up in work camps, and hereditary-forced labor was put in place. That's a very different thing than the personal slavery that existed elsewhere."],"Edward Bellamy":["If bread is the first necessity of life, recreation is a close second.","The primal principle of democracy is the worth and dignity of the individual.","I first saw the light in the city of Boston in the year 1857."],"Edward Bennett Williams":["I will defend anyone as long as the client gives me total control of the case and pays up front.","They don't need a lawyer, they need a toastmaster.","What are you supposed to do - stop practicing law whenever one of your friends becomes president?","You understand, of course, that I can only get you access.","In life every effort is marked down at the end as a win or a loss.","These newspaper reporters... ever since Sullivan versus New York Times... have got a license to lie."],"Edward Blake":["I fear the carnival of crime is beginning on our border.","As far as I can judge, not much good can be done without disturbing something or somebody.","I may err in judgment, but I hope not in intention.","The accumulation of personal wealth and the extension of commercial transactions have developed a great and lamentable increase in certain classes of crimes, while the improvements in transport have largely facilitated the escape of fugitive criminals."],"Edward Bok":["The fact must never be forgotten that no magazine publisher in the United States could give what it is giving to the reader each month if it were not for the revenue which the advertiser brings the magazine.","It is the growth of advertising in this country which, more than any single element, has brought the American magazine to its present enviable position in points of literary, illustrative and mechanical excellence.","The American advertiser has made the superior American magazine of today possible."],"Edward Bond":["The human mind is a dramatic structure in itself and our society is absolutely saturated with drama.","We are still living in the aftershock of Hiroshima, people are still the scars of history.","The Greeks said very, very extreme things in their tragedies.","I think there is no world without theatre.","Auschwitz is a place in which tragedy cannot occur.","If you engage people on a vital, important level, they will respond.","But we are not in the world to be good but to change it.","The truth has got to appear plausible on the stage.","First there was the theatre of people and animals, then of people and the devil. Now we need the theatre of people and people.","I write plays not to make money, but to stop myself from going mad. Because it's my way of making the world rational to me.","Whatever the economy needs to maintain itself, the government will do it.","All you now do is pursue your private objectives within society. Instead of us being a community, everybody is asked to seek their own personal ends. It's called competition. And competition is antagonism.","When humanness is lost the radical difference between the bodies in the pit and people walking on the street is lost.","Humanity's become a product and when humanity is a product, you get Auschwitz and you get Chair.","The English sent all their bores abroad, and acquired the Empire as a punishment.","Art is the close scrutiny of reality and therefore I put on the stage only those things that I know happen in our society.","At the turn of the century theatre does not have to be prescriptive.","Fifteen years ago I walked out of a production of one of my plays at the RSC because I decided it was a waste of time.","I don't think it's the job of theatre at the moment to provide political propaganda; that would be simplistic. We have to explore our situation further before we will understand it.","I'm interested in the real world.","I'm not interested in an imaginary world.","In the end I think theatre has only one subject: justice.","In the past goodness was always a collective experience. Then goodness became privatised.","It seems to me that we are profoundly ignorant of ourselves.","It's insulting to ask a dramatist what his view of his play is. I have no opinion.","It's politely assumed that democracy is a means of containing and restraining violence. But violence comes not from genes but from ideas.","It's wonderful to be able to sit down and write a play.","Now, drama is quite useful at helping us to understand what our position is and, conversely, we might then understand why our theatre is being destroyed.","Our unconscious is not more animal than our conscious, it is often even more human.","Religion enabled society to organise itself to debate goodness, just as Greek drama had once done.","Shakespeare has no answers for us at all.","The one overall structure in my plays is language.","The theatre, our theatre, comes from the Greeks.","Violence is hidden within democratic structures because they are not radically democratic - Western democracy is merely a domestic convenience of consumerism.","Violence is never a solution in my plays, just as ultimately violence is never a solution in human affairs.","We may seem competent, but by the end of next century there will be new deserts, new ruins.","What I try to do in a play is put a problem on stage, head-on, without evasion.","What Shakespeare and the Greeks were able to do was radically question what it meant to be a human being.","You have to go to the ultimate situation in drama.","You have to learn the language of Hamlet."],"Edward Boyden":["I was interested in big unknowns, and the brain is one of the biggest, so building tools that allow us to regard the brain as a big electrical circuit appealed to me.","It's not even known how many kinds of cells there are in the brain. If you were looking for a periodic table of the brain, there is no such thing. I really like to think of the brain as a computer.","What I'm really interested in is this idea of a 'brain co-processor' - a device that can record from, and deliver information to, so many points in the brain, with a computational infrastructure in between - a computer that can process the information and compute exactly what needs to be restored."],"Edward Brooke":["Power corrupts, absolute power corrupts absolutely, and I found that out when I was Attorney General in Massachusetts.","I'm looking for the best person irregardless of political party, of race or religion, or color of their skin. Those things don't matter to me. I want someone who's qualified, who has a qualification to character and the integrity to do the things that have to be done to save this world.","Intemperance and intolerance serve no one, and hatred guarantees failure.","The polarization of Congress; the decline of civility; and the rise of attack politics in the 1980s, the 1990s, and the early years of the new century are a blot on our political system and a disservice to the American people.","President Nixon has lost his effectiveness as the leader of this country, primarily because he has lost the confidence of the people.","When I left the Senate in 1979, there were several publishers who had approached me about writing an autobiography, and I knew that politicians write books for many reasons, but at that time, I just thought I wasn't ready and my story wasn't over, and I knew I had a new life ahead of me.","My fervent expectation is that sooner rather than later, the United States Senate will more closely reflect the rich diversity of this great country.","You can't say the Negro left the Republican Party; the Negro feels he was evicted from the Republican Party.","I am not a civil rights leader, and I don't profess to be one.","I can't serve just the Negro cause. I've got to serve all the people of Massachusetts.","I grew up segregated, but there was not much feeling of being shut out of anything.","I never studied much at Howard, but at Boston University, I didn't do much else but study.","My campaign confirmed my belief that although there are bigots in America, whose hateful rhetoric seizes the media's attention, the vast majority of people do not harbor such prejudice.","Politics is not a tea party. When it is time to act, you have to move fast and decisively.","When most presidents get in, they move to the center because they realize that this is a centrist country - even Reagan.","In my state, the Republican Party was the most progressive party.","I always believed there would be an African-American president. It was something I'd dreamed about, thought about, but certainly did not believe would happen in my lifetime.","I want to be elected on my own ability. Only then do you have progress... People should not use race as a basis for labelling me.","I chose the Republican Party early on in the 1950s and 1960s in Massachusetts. My father was a Republican, as was my mother, in Virginia.","I had male breast cancer and had dual radical modified mastectomy, and I've spent a lot of time working with the Susan G. Komen foundation to make men aware of male breast cancer - if you have breast tissue, you can have breast cancer.","I don't intend to leave the Republican Party, but I would like to move the Republican Party more to the center.","Richard Nixon was a very complex man. I don't think he was a conservative, nor liberal, not even a moderate. He was a pragmatic politician. He loved politics.","Fred Thompson was a law partner of mine.","When I arrived in the Senate, the moderate so-called Rockefeller Republicans held the balance of power.","I was entirely comfortable reaching across the Senate aisle to work with Democrats.","I was one of God's chosen few, no doubt about it. Not only being elected, but the joy and pleasure I derived from it. It was a wonderful life.","I've never tried to run away from my race. I was born a black man. You know that in your bones as soon as you are able to understand this country... My approach to life about race is, I don't see the difference between black people and white people.","I wanted to go to Washington to bring people together who had never been together before. I wanted to break down the barriers between races.","I had made my reputation on integrity."],"Edward Bryant":["There's no way my body can be fixed, but what we can hope to do is keep all the deteriorative processes as minimal as possible.","The future is no longer indefinite. Time has become very finite to me and very precious.","I make a genuine distinction between loneliness and aloneness. I know what each is like. There are times I'm lonely. But there are also many times when I need to be alone, when I don't want the feeling of someone else in the house other than the cats.","People think I write weird, but there are people at Death Equinox that make me look like Danielle Steele.","I don't like pain."],"Edward Burnett Tylor":["At sunset we are rattling through the streets of the little town of Cordova.","If you are a married man resident in Cuba, you cannot get a passport to go to the next town without your wife's permission in writing.","One step outside the gate, and we are among the sand-hills that stretch for miles and miles round Vera Cruz.","There are even many huts built entirely of the universal aloe.","Aching all over, we reached level ground again, and Mr. Christy withdrew his claims, and agreed that no road anywhere else could possibly be so bad as a Mexican road; a decision which later experiences only served to confirm.","Coughs seem very common here, especially among the children, though people look strong and healthy, but in the absence of proper statistics one cannot undertake to say whether the district is a healthy one or not.","During the Tertiary period the whole valley of Mexico was one great lake.","Even if severe wounds are given, the Indian has many chances in his favor, for his organization is somewhat different from that of white men, and he recovers easily from wounds that would kill any European outright.","Every one knows how the snow lies in the valleys of the Alps, forming a plain which slopes gradually downward towards the outlet Imagine such a valley ten miles across, with just such a sloping plain, not of snow but of earth.","Everything that is really Mexican is either Aztec or Spanish.","I am afraid the Spanish American has not always a very strict regard for truth.","Taking it as a whole, Mexico is a grand city, and, as Cortes truly said, its situation is marvellous.","The habit of building houses upon piles, which was first forced upon the people by the position they had chosen, was afterwards followed as a matter of taste, just as it is in Holland.","The interior of Mexico consists of a mass of volcanic rocks, thrust up to a great height above the sea-level.","The journey and excursions in Mexico which have originated the narrative and remarks contained in this volume were made in the months of March, April, May, and June of 1856, for the most part on horseback.","The plateau of Mexico is 8,000 feet high, and that of Puebla 9,000 feet.","There was no romance about the mosquitos, however.","We are at last on the high lands of Mexico, the districts which at least three different races have chosen to settle in, neglecting the fertile country below.","We were very kindly received by the English merchants to whom my companion had letters, and we set ourselves to learn what was the real state of things in Mexico.","Whenever anything disagreeable is happening in the country, Vera Cruz is sure to get its full share."],"Edward Burns":["Actors are con men and con men are actors.","I'm always aware of who my core audiences are and I serve that niche.","I mean the cool thing about the movies is that you get to try on these different personalities and different styles.","I'd been offered TV series over the years and never had any interest in doing television. I'm not a TV guy.","I suffer from Irish-Catholic guilt. Guilt is a good reality check. It keeps that 'do what makes you happy' thing in check.","When I was 25 years old and had no money - and didn't know how to make movies and had no experience - I was able to get $25,000 together, and that film was 'The Brothers McMullen.'","I'm betting that in two years I'll be talking to you about a film that I shot on an iPhone. It's absolutely coming, I have no doubt in my mind.","So you got the cool New Yorkers, and then there are the less-than-cool New Yorkers.","I feel Irish-Americans are the forgotten minority group. Nobody else is making films about them.","Newlyweds shooting budget: 5k for actors, 2k insurance, 2k food and drink. 9k in the can. We only shot 12 days. That's how to make an independent film.","You make a movie for 9k for the freedom it allows you.","You know, I've certainly gone through periods, once I got into this business, where I tried to adopt maybe a more sophisticated style, 'cause they give you all these free clothes.","And at no point did making 'Brothers McMullen' feel like work or hardship. It was really just a matter of 11 days of fun over the course of 8 months.","I spent four months in Prague in these blue rooms reacting to nothing and you basically place your faith in the hands of the director and the special effects co-coordinator and you keep your fingers crossed and hope that the creatures look really scary.","The stigma of the straight-to-DVD thing is over.","Look: You're not gonna become a millionaire doing this, but that was never the point. And I think a lot of people in the indie film business kind of took their eye off of that.","Quite honestly, it's too tough to get your movies made and then also to get out there and sell them.","When you work with a DeNiro or Hoffman, they love what they do so much that there's never any competitive vibe. It's more about how do we do this thing together.","The con movie is a little bit different where maybe we tell you what we're going to do but it never goes down the way you expect because there's so much double-crossing and cheats and lies going on along the whole way.","But the longer I'm in the business, you see a lot of times these screenplays have been rewritten 5 times and you're not really offending an author.","Spielberg gave us three takes before saying anything to us. Since then, I do that, three takes, to let the actors find their rhythm.","Woody Allen would go for seven years without a movie and then make one that makes no money.","It is a juggling act and I have been in it for 12 years now, which is about 11 years longer than I thought I would be, and then the priority there is thinking how can I stay somewhat irrelevant so that you can continue to survive and can continue to work and put yourself in a position to get to do the work you are truly passionate about.","People that went to art house theatre have more options, I used to go, but now think any movie can be delivered in a red envelope three months after it's released so why not watch it on my flat screen in the comfort of home.","I am a big fan of the old Howard Hawks films from the 30s and 40s, I was a big Hepburn and Tracey fan for a while and Woody Allen films that are a very different kind of romantic comedy.","I was a kid who went to film school and fell into acting.","But at a certain point, you have to take your influence and find your own voice if you want to become a relevant artist.","Maybe I should have taken a few chances. That's not to say I want to go make 'Star Wars', but I need to shift my career into the studio world. That's where my head was at when I thought of the original plot.","'Brothers McMullen' would not be picked up for theatrical distribution now.","That's my advice for indie filmmakers: Marry a supermodel.","The way I see it, when I go out as an actor, it should be on a type of film I'm never going to do as a director.","Well, honestly, the films I personally like to go see are smaller, more character-driven pieces, so that's why the movies I've made have been smaller, more character-driven movies.","It's so hard to raise money for independent films and the fact of the matter is that the bigger my star or whatever is, as a result of doing bigger pictures, the easier it is for me to get money for my own projects.","Well, for one thing, you know my dad was a cop."],"Edward Burtynsky":["Digital photography and Photoshop have made it very easy for people to take pictures. It's a medium that allows a lot of mediocre stuff to get through.","I'm trying to photograph an old offshore oil city that is lying in decay in the Caspian Sea, but I've been having a hard time getting there.","Sometimes you don't know why you're doing something. You're intuitively following, to see where it leads.","The bigger question is how does a rogue species called humans - whose population just blew through the seven billion mark on it's way to nine billion members - manage to survive the next century on a planet with finite resources, without destroying its delicate balance in the process.","I can go into the wilderness and not see anyone for days and experience a kind of space that hasn't changed for tens of thousands of years. Having that experience was necessary to my perception of how photography can look at the changes humanity has brought about in the landscape. My work does become a kind of lament.","I wish my artwork could persuade millions of people to join a global conversation about sustainability.","I wish we could launch a ground-breaking competition that motivates kids to invent new ideas in sustainable living.","I wish I could create an IMAX film that would make my work accessible to a broader audience.","I think the environmental movement has failed in that it's used the stick too much; it's used the apocalyptic tone too much; it hasn't sold the positive aspects of being environmentally concerned and trying to pull us out.","Like all animals, human beings have always taken what they want from nature. But we are the rogue species. We are unique in our ability to use resources on a scale and at a speed that our fellow species can't.","Water, like many other resources, is harvested, transported and used throughout all aspects of society. Unlike other resources, water is critical to the survival of all forms of life. The underlying question that sits at the core of my exploration is to what degree can we shape water before it begins to shape us.","I had to work to put myself through school, so I always worked in the heaviest industries I could find because that's who paid the best.","I'm working in this very complex set of issues having to do with who we are as a species and how much we can do to the Earth before it starts to buckle under. My work can easily read as an indictment, but I don't see it as that simple a problem.","Somebody referred to what I do as subliminal activism, which I like."],"Edward C. Prescott":["Economic integration is the path to riches and peace.","In the Great Depression, employment and investment were low because labor market institutions and industrial polices changed.","There is an old maxim which states that good judgment comes from experience, and experience comes from poor judgment. I think something similar can be said of government policy, to wit: Good policy comes from experience, and experience comes from poor policy.","After World War II, there were a lot of pension funds in Europe that were fully funded, but they were pressured to hold a lot of government debt. There was a lot of inflation, and the value of all those assets fell. Those pension funds couldn't honor their promises to the people.","It is an established scientific fact that monetary policy has had virtually no effect on output and employment in the U.S. since the formation of the Fed.","Of all the thankless jobs that economists set for themselves when it comes to educating people about economics, the notion that society is better off if some industries are allowed to wither, their workers lose their jobs, and investors lose their capital - all in the name of the greater glory of globalization - surely ranks near the top.","The Chinese are saving like mad, but they are not getting a very good return on their savings.","At some point, the spectacular growth in China has to stop.","Monetary policy causes booms and busts.","Despite the impression created by some economic pundits, the U.S. economy is not a delicate little machine that needs to be fine-tuned with exact precision by benevolent policymakers to keep from breaking down.","Multinational companies use their technological know-how in their foreign subsidiaries, so reciprocal multinational relationships are key - they lead to a vested interest in both countries to remaining open.","A lot of technological capital has to be absorbed person-to-person, and that happens more quickly if countries are economically integrated.","In the category of economic superpowers, more is better than less - the more technology those leaders develop, the more we all benefit.","You need a real crisis before you have reforms.","The money is nice, but I am not in this game for the money.","Economists create their own worlds. We're like little gods with our artificial economics, wanting to see what happens.","I love creating models and coming up with explicit structures I can play with.","Random distributions are not good things, because people are risk-averse, and this risk adversely affects their welfare. If you get too much price uncertainty, all kinds of long-term, mutually beneficial contracts can't be entered into.","You can't spend your way to prosperity.","If productivity grows, the economy does well.","Sometimes pessimism or optimism gets popular, and it's contagious."],"Edward Carey":["I had a very happy childhood. But I was sent off to boarding school at quite a young age, this massive Victorian house that was suffocated in ivy. I think there is a part of that school in 'Heap House.'","I inhaled Dickens as a kid, and I've always been fascinated by the Victorians. So many ridiculous objects they had! They created things like mustache cups, so you wouldn't wet your mustache when you were drinking tea. And eyebrow combs. What's happened to all the eyebrow combs? Marvelous things.","An ideal reader is someone who doesn't know what on Earth you've been doing, who will look at it with absolute freshness and go, 'Oh, so that's what you've been up to.'","Part of the joy of writing for kids is that you have to have a real adventure story. You can get really involved in the fantastic in a way that perhaps you can't so much in adult fiction.","Fairy tales, before they were sanitized, were very dark, and kids love that. 'Coraline' by Neil Gaiman feels like Beckett for kids. I think there's plenty of room for that. And I think there's a danger of being too patronizing to children, having things too sanitized.","I was sent to Naval School when I was young, and it didn't do me any good in any other form, but it made me get up in the morning.","Every new writing project, every new artistic project, needs to be protected so it can grow on its own before it begins to creep out into the world."],"Edward Carpenter":["Where there had been only jeers or taunts at first, crowds come to listen with serious and sympathetic men.","Great success in examinations does naturally not as a rule go with originality of thought.","Early in 1888 one or two of us got together to establish our own Sheffield Socialist Society.","With my somewhat vague aspiring mind, to be imprisoned in the rude details of a most material life was often irksome.","Do not think too much of the dead husk of your friend, or mourn too much over it, but send your thoughts out towards the real soul or self which has escaped - to reach it.","For so, surely you will cast a light of gladness upon his onward journey, and contribute your part towards the building of that kingdom of love which links our earth to heaven.","I might have simply settled down into an armchair literary life. I really don't know exactly why I didn't.","I should like these few words to be read over the grave when my body is placed in the earth; for though it is possible I may be present and conscious of what is going on, I shall not be able to communicate.","I was in the Square at the time. The crowd was a most good-humoured, easy going, smiling crowd; but presently it was transformed. A regiment of mounted police came cantering up.","IN April 1882 my father died; and I was at once whirled out of my land of dreams into a very different sphere.","It is curious that, with my somewhat antinomian tendencies, I should have gone to Trinity Hall - which was, and is, before all a Law College - and should thus have been thrown into close touch with the legal element in life.","My ideas had been taking a socialistic shape for many years; but they were lacking in definite outline.","The general fact of surplus value, namely that the workmen does not get the full value of his labours, and that he is taken advantage of by the capitalist, is obvious.","The other thing that happened in 1883 was my reading of Thoreau's Walden.","We lived within two hundred yards of the sea, and its voice was in our ears night and day.","Whatever the practical value of the Walden experiment may be, there is no question that the book is one of the most vital and pithy ever written.","When he was twenty-three or twenty-four my father began to learn German and read philosophy in his spare hours, which did not look as though he were destined to remain long on board ship!"],"Edward Cocker":["When Honor's sun declines, and Wealth takes wings, Then Learning shines, the best of precious things.","Learn avidly.

Walt Disney Every decision you make is a mistake.","So much of our lives is given over to the consideration of our imperfections that there is no time to improve our imaginary virtues. The truth is we only perfect our vices, and man is a worse creature when he dies than he was when he was born.","Ambition is a Dead Sea fruit, and the greatest peril to the soul is that one is likely to get precisely what he is seeking.","The bad poet is a toady mimicking nature.","Genius, like truth, has a shabby and neglected mien.","To write is a humiliation.","Nothing in our times has become so unattractive as virtue.","The Americans have always been food, sex, and spirit revivalists.","The ancients understood the regulation of power better than the regulation of liberty.","Herman Melville was as separated from a civilized literature as the lost Atlantis was said to have been from the great peoples of the earth.","The machine has had a pernicious effect upon virtue, pity, and love, and young men used to machines which induce inertia, and fear, are near impotent."],"Edward Dmytryk":["I knew that if it ever got down to a choice between the Party and our traditional democratic structure I would fight the Party and our traditional democratic structure I would fight the Party to the bitter end.","I only knew a few people, literally a handful of people, al of whom had been in the Party long before I was, all of whom were known by the FBI and were known to the Committee.","I was surprised to see the meeting was of Communists and the whole meeting was along Communist lines.","In art, the obvious is a sin.","Technical skill counts for nothing if it is used only to manufacture films which have little to do with humanity.","The film's dramatic requirements should always take precedence over the mere aesthetics of editing.","The only reason for using another cut is to improve the scene.","With me it was that defending the Communist Party was something worse than naming the names.","I believed that I was being forced to sacrifice my family and my career in defense of the Communist Party, from which I had long been separated and which I had grown to dislike and distrust.","Not a single person I named hadn't already been named at least a half-dozen times and wasn't already on he blacklist."],"Edward Dowden":["Sometimes a noble failure serves the world as faithfully as a distinguished success.","Browning's tragedies are tragedies without villains.","For a poet to depict a poet in poetry is a hazardous experiment; in regarding one's own trade a sense of humour and a little wholesome cynicism are not amiss."],"Edward Dyer":["And love is love in beggars and in kings.","My mind to me a kingdom is, such present joys therein I find, that it excels all other bliss.","Some have too much, yet still do crave; I little have, and seek no more.

I have never been one to put on airs and graces.","Most of the time, working as a stylist, you're at home, working on your own, researching.","When I was growing up, David Bowie was my idol. I grew up in inner-city London, and he was from Brixton, which is even more urban.","For me, fashion succeeds when it says something about the times we live in.","The funny thing is that the fashions from the '90s seem to sit so well with the fashions of 2016. Everything from then somehow skipped and came back.","When I was 18 years old, I moved into Neneh Cherry's house in Kensal Rise with Judy Blame and our friend Michael Boadi.","I was very honoured to be awarded an OBE in 2016 for my services to diversity in the fashion industry.","In my work, I have always tried to push the boundaries of what fashion can do.","Never forget that it sometimes takes a foreigner's eye to capture Britain most clearly.","People like me thought America was the best place to be creative, to be free to create, to have the freedom to be who you are.","I felt like I grew up with Bowie. I never dressed like him, even though I did love the music, but consistently throughout my career he has been a go-to reference point: The suit from 'Young Americans,' or the gold Missoni-type looks of Ziggy Stardust. 'The Berlin Years' still influences me.","There's a lot of research and time that goes into my shoots. I spend weeks on them, even for one picture.","You never know where inspiration is going to come from.","I am definitely allergic to wheat. Every time I eat it, I feel awful.","I'm very proud of the world that's embracing all these different ideas of what it is to be diverse, in 2017.","When you start out in the industry and things are tough, and you're not really making money, you question yourself: should I give up?","Being an immigrant and living in England, I feel like I lived in two worlds. There was the world that, when I was at school with my friends, was very English, and then I'd go home to another country, with exotic foods and colours. I have a sense of colour pairings, and that came from my background, I think.","A queen does not wear clothes off the runways.","Change always takes time.","The fashion industry needs to breed a whole different way of thinking. We need more diverse people working in all facets of the industry.","I like to play with contrast. It's about changing people's perceptions of people.","I learned that fashion was about more than fancy images. That there was a business side as well.","I'd never seen anything like it in my life. Someone so blatantly challenging the ideas of race and gender and sexuality. In a way, it was comparable to David Bowie, except that Prince brought that to the black community.","Prince was not scared. The first time I heard someone sing about AIDS, it was Prince: 'In France, a skinny man died of a big disease with a little name.' He was not afraid of taboos.","I am black in a predominantly white industry, and I have been luckier than most.","I grew up in an African household, so lots of chicken, lots of rice. We ate Jollof rice, a very West African dish.","I didn't know anything about the fashion industry until I met the stylist Simon Foxton on a Tube. I was 16, on my way to Kingsway College, and then my whole world opened up. Before that, like in every African family, you are meant to be a lawyer.","I come from a family who didn't have much money but raised me to believe that money wasn't the most important thing in the world. We had enough; we were happy.","I'm really excited to see my vision for the 'British Vogue' team come to fruition.","I was really sheltered growing up, with six brothers and sisters. We played together all the time, and I was living in a fantasy world, like most creative people.","My mother was a seamstress, so I always grew up with her making clothes. I knew how to construct outfits. I knew how to sketch. I knew how to customise. But I could never imagine it as a career.","I can't just go in and throw clothes at a picture. I still have to have some kind of an idea of a character, of who she is, where she's from. It's almost like playing a child's game. You have your dolls, and you create characters for them. Fashion indulged that in me.","My 'Vogue' is about being inclusive; it's about diversity. Showing different women, different body shapes, different races, class. To be tackling gender.","When I started in the nineties, a sample size was a 4 and a 6.","I grew up reading 'British Vogue' - I am so honoured and humbled to be taking up the mantle of editor.","'British Vogue' is a great magazine with a legacy of creativity and innovation.","I don't think everything has to be new all the time. You don't have to have the latest designer all the time to look good. Just have things you're comfortable with, have key pieces that you can sort of reinvent over and over again, and always keep things that you really love for a while.","A lot of my friends, we all grew up sort of not very wealthy. And in England, whatever ends up being a negative, that's a positive.","The best photographers know how to light any color skin.","I think if you're really good at what you do, you can see outside the box.","I'm so fascinated by the influence of social media on fashion. I've seen so many artists on Instagram, up and comers you would have never known otherwise.","Coming from a family who put a lot of emphasis on academics, I always thought I was going to be a lawyer.","When I was really young, I had an afro and wore pressed jeans and argyle sweaters. In my teens, I moved on to ripped Levi's jeans, white T-shirts, and cowboy boots.","I've learned to put a big value on having a life outside of fashion, and I think that's what's saved me, because the fashion industry can suck you in.","Social media is fine, depending on how you use it.","I feel like when it comes to the models, certain models are now like commodities in certain ways.","If you put one model in a show or in an ad campaign, that doesn't solve the problem. We need teachers in universities. We need internships. We need people of different ethnic backgrounds in all parts of the industry. That really is the solution: you have to change it from the inside.","Music, for me, is as important as fashion. The first visuals I remember are Elvis Presley, David Bowie, New Romantics, and different punk bands.","I don't think I'm in any way an icon, to be very honest.","I'm just propelled by insecurity; that's what really leads me to want to do better.","I get nervous before every shoot. I'm really jealous of the people that can just rest on their laurels and say, 'I'm good; this is it.'","I realise I am stepping into the shoes of a hugely respected editor in the shape of Alexandra Shulman, someone who has chosen to leave at the top of their game with a legacy of 25 years of success.","I didn't grow up with money; I didn't come from a rich family. But what fashion gave me was an escape into a world of creativity: if I couldn't afford that Junior Gaultier jacket, then I'd get one from the market and customise it.","When you leave your house in the morning, however you dress is the way you want the world to see you.","I think fashion can tell a story about celebrating difference, can talk about how different people are, how diverse people are - and for me, that's where fashion really succeeds, when it tackles things to do with the world we live in.","My memories of London Fashion Week are of starting out and not getting many tickets for fashion shows, but wanting to see them so much that I'd sneak in with my friends, people like Pat McGrath and Craig McDean.","I've always been very fascinated by technology - the Internet, social media.","With Rihanna, it's always a collaboration, and that's why I love her so much.","I take random inspiration from everywhere.","It was a whole new attitude: no makeup, less is more... the '90s were fun!","Kurt Cobain really made an impression on us. He just had that rebel attitude. You could tell he was super talented but didn't really care.","I used to wear a lot of Helmut Lang. Painted jeans. Cropped crombies with t-shirts. A lot of V-necks. The perfect V-neck was very important.","I love the optimistic American style that Gap celebrates and the simplicity of the basic white T-shirt that allows you to be yourself.","Growing up, I loved the imagery I saw from America as it celebrated being the land of the free and home of the brave.","I can tell you, without diversity, creativity remains stagnant.","Diversity is very important for me.","People of power have to show empathy and kindness to the young.","I'm very protective of all the vulnerable young kids that go on shoots. I can empathize. I've been there.","I want 'Vogue' to feel like a shop that you're not scared to walk into, one that's quite welcoming.","I grew up in west London, but my dad wouldn't let me go to school there, so I went in south London.","The more you style, the better you get. Don't give up. At a certain point, the magic happens.","You could say slowly but surely, the world is changing in a good way - equality in all forms is more and more part of the global conversation, and people are celebrating diversity and individuality.","Social media and technology are democratising and opening up fashion and the process of fashion for all - this has good and bad sides, but that comes with any change."],"Edward Everett Hale":["Coming together is a beginning; keeping together is progress; working together is success.","Life seeks life and loves life. The opening of a catkin of a willow, in the flight of the butterfly, in the chirping of a tree-toad or the sweep of an eagle - my life loves to see how others live, exults in their joy, and so far is partner in their great concern.","I am only one, but I am one. I cannot do everything, but I can do something. And I will not let what I cannot do interfere with what I can do.","The making of friends who are real friends, is the best token we have of a man's success in life.","The Resurrection miracle is nothing to you and me if it is only an event of eighteen centuries bygone. Unless we can live the immortal life - unless we can receive God to his own home in these hearts of ours - the texts are nothing to us unless these daily lives illustrate them.","Wrong fails because it is wrong. The wrongs, the untruths, are inconsistent with each other. They clash against each other and confute each other. They neutralize each other and are lost.","To look forward and not back, To look out and not in, and To lend a hand.","Never bear more than one kind of trouble at a time. Some people bear three kinds of trouble - the ones they've had, the ones they have, and the ones they expect to have.","'Do you pray for the senators, Dr. Hale?' No, I look at the senators and I pray for the country.","If you have accomplished all that you have planned for yourself, you have not planned enough.","Make it your habit not to be critical about small things.","Gentlemen and ladies are sure of their ground. They pretend to nothing that they are not.","It seems as if, for every dragon head that is lopped off, two more terrible appear. Seems so. But in truth, Life is gaining all the while. Brute force, such power as there seems to be in things, cannot stand against ideas which are eternal.","Wise anger is like fire from a flint: there is great ado to get it out; and when it does come, it is out again immediately.","It sometimes seems easier to trace the great general laws of God's government in the passage of events far from us than in those close around us. We see the shape of those far-off constellations, but we cannot group or set in order that to which our own sun belongs.","In the name of Hypocrites, doctors have invented the most exquisite form of torture ever known to man: survival.","War - hard apprenticeship of freedom.","Nineteen centuries would have been worth very little if we had not made some advance in welcoming the stranger, in feeding the hungry, in clothing the naked, and in caring for the prisoner.","How indifferent are men to this carpenter or that fisherman, who has no word to speak of adventure or of wealth, but has only the word of God to proclaim, and has no credentials but that he comes in the name of the Lord.","You may take this as a general and central principle in criticism: that all science, literature or song, which recognizes conscious life as the ruling principle of the universe, is Christian.","Thrones, dominations, principalities know now with a terrible certainty that mere force of arms has no power which compares with that living word of the crucified Nazarene, that bears with it Eternal Life, and directs the duty of a world of men whom he can lead, but who bend no knee to power.","You need the living, loving heart of living, loving men and women to quicken other hearts, which can live too and love too, and, in their turn, will quicken others which are dying now.","The great event of history is in the great miracle of Life: when, to a paralyzed world, Jesus Christ said, 'Take up your bed and walk,' and at his voice, that world obeyed. The victory of life over death!","Let a man live with God, not afraid to talk with him. Let him study God's plans and methods, as one of Michelangelo's pupils might study his.","Do well what you do. And do it conscious that you ought to be leaders among men.","Do not blow your own trumpets nor, which is the same thing, ask other people to blow them. No trumpeter ever rose to be a general."],"Edward Everett":["In Italy, on the breaking up of the Roman Empire, society might be said to be resolved into its original elements, - into hostile atoms, whose only movement was that of mutual repulsion.","In conformity with these designs on the city of Washington, and notwithstanding the disastrous results of the invasion of 1862, it was determined by the Rebel government last summer to resume the offensive in that direction.","Education is a better safeguard of liberty than a standing army.","And now the momentous day, a day to be forever remembered in the annals of the country, arrived. Early in the morning on the 1st of July the conflict began.","General Reynolds immediately found himself engaged with a force which greatly outnumbered his own, and had scarcely made his dispositions for the action when he fell, mortally wounded, at the head of his advance.","I feel, as never before, how justly, from the dawn of history to the present time, men have paid the homage of their gratitude and admiration to the memory of those who nobly sacrifice their lives, that their fellow-men may live in safety and in honor.","I will not refuse to do something that I can do.","God bless the Union; - it is dearer to us for the blood of brave men which has been shed in its defence.","It was appointed by law in Athens, that the obsequies of the citizens who fell in battle should be performed at the public expense, and in the most honorable manner.","Let a nation's fervent thanks make some amends for the toils and sufferings of those who survive.","Not a moment had been lost by General Hooker in the pursuit of Lee.","That a great battle must soon be fought no one could doubt; but, in the apparent and perhaps real absence of plan on the part of Lee, it was impossible to foretell the precise scene of the encounter.","The heart of the People, North and South, is for the Union.","There were speeches made in Congress in the very last session before the outbreak of the Rebellion, so ferocious as to show that their authors were under the influence of a real frenzy.","There is no sanctuary of virtue like home."],"Edward Felten":["Innovation happens because there are people out there doing and trying a lot of different things.","We're in a situation where the solutions that we have are not good enough. The way to improve anything is to have a discussion about its flaws. To understand what the one or two or three things are about it that would help fix it. The DMCA makes it dangerous to have that conversation.","I think there are problems with compact disc copy protection that can't be resolved.","Growth comes out of a healthy competitive atmosphere, not trying to choose a particular path forward.","Even if there were no illegal copying, the advent of digital distribution will put a lot of stress on the movie and music industry. When the distribution costs comes down, that puts more price pressure on the rest of the cost.","In making policy designed with copyright in mind, you end up making decisions about whether other important technologies, such as privacy-enhancing or file-search technologies, should be encouraged or discouraged. A collision is happening between creativity and protecting IP.","Given that you'll never be able to prevent copying, the question is, what can you do to minimize it? What can you do to make consumers happy enough with legitimate use of the system that they'll be willing to pay for it?","The problem - when you cast your net that wide - is you inevitably catch something you don't want to catch.","Vigorous enforcement of copyrights themselves is an important part of the picture. But I don't think that expanding the legal definition of copyright outside of actual copyright infringement is the right move.","The secret of the Internet's success has been its openness to new services.","The question is not whether we want to keep this open, neutral Internet - we do, or should - but whether government rulemaking can give us the result we want.","The next generation of innovators, who need neutrality the most, are not at the bargaining table. They're hard at work in their labs or classrooms, dreaming of the next big thing, and hoping that the Internet is as open to them as it was to the founders of Google.","Network operators need reasonable leeway to manage their networks.","And the user may have a higher comfort level deciding what information to provide rather than worrying about what inferences might be made from what they've gathered."],"Edward Fitzgerald":["I came like Water, and like Wind I go.","If you can prove to me that one miracle took place, I will believe he is a just God who damned us all because a woman ate an apple.","The Wine of Life keeps oozing drop by drop, The Leaves of Life keep falling one by one.","There was the Door to which I found no key; There was the Veil through which I might see.","Ah, take the Cash in hand and waive the Rest.","The Ball no question makes of Ayes and Noes, But Here or There as strikes the Player goes.","Strange, is it not? That of the myriads who Before us pass'd the door of Darkness through, Not one returns to tell us of the Road Which to discover we must travel too.","Think then you are Today what Yesterday you were - Tomorrow you shall not be less.","I sometimes think that never blows so red The Rose as where some buried Caesar bled; That every Hyacinth the Garden wears Dropt in her Lap from some once lovely Head.","Taste is the feminine of genius.","I am all for the short and merry life.","A book of verses underneath the bough, A jug of wine, a loaf of bread-and thou.","And much as Wine has played the Infidel, And robbed me of my Robe of Honor Well, I often wonder what the Vintners buy One half so precious as the stuff they sell.","The Moving Finger writes; and, having writ, Moves on: nor all your Piety nor Wit Shall lure it back to cancel half a Line, Nor all your Tears wash out a Word of it."],"Edward Forbes":["As we descend deeper and deeper in this region its inhabitants become more and more modified, and fewer and fewer, indicating our approach towards an abyss where life is either extinguished, or exhibits but a few sparks to mark its lingering presence.","Zero of Animal Life probably about 300 fathoms.","I have in hands, now, specimens of bottom from t he Gulf Stream, obtained by Lieutenant Craven, and I can say that they are among the most interesting that I have ever seen.","The corals do not look much worn, but still appear to have been dead. There are some delicate shells of molluscs from depths beyond 500 fathoms, where they were certainly living.","The naturalists of our own time hold equal faith in the wonders of the sea, but seek therein rather for the links of nature's chain than for apparent exceptions.","Moreover, all our knowledge of organic remains teaches us, that species have a definite existence, and a centralization in geological time as well as in geographical space, and that no species is repeated in time."],"Edward Furlong":["I have a little brother. He's actually living at my house right now. He's going to be 18.","I had a hard time going back to school after T2. I really didn't want to go to private school.","It hasn't been a totally smooth road, but in the whole span of things I feel like a very lucky person.","I was scared I was going to have some weird shape to my head and I was pleased that I didn't.","If I was in a room with a bunch of skinheads talking about racism, then I would be disturbed, but after we finished a take, we were normal people again.","I enjoy playing people that are totally different than me.","People aren't born racist.","I've always wanted to do a movie that takes place in the 70's and was about rock and roll and getting high, like Dazed and Confused or Fast Times at Ridgemont High.","The first willing concert I went to was Aerosmith when I was like 14.","Little Odessa. Of all my movies, it's the one that I still really love when I watch it and I'm pretty happy with what I didn in that.","It's really hard to find good movies, and that's pretty much what I try to find, good movies.","But i think it would drive me more crazy to just go do a movie that I didn't believe in, you know?","I don't think anyone has a normal family.","I'd be a liar if I said I had a normal family.","Who wants to go to school and be asked for, like, 20 autographs?","A lot of people my age are so hyper. I like hyper people.","But I'm not like sad, depressed miserable person. I guess sometimes I give off that impression.","Detroit was kind of a random thing where it was like a chance to be in a rock 'n' roll movie.","I'm so embarrassed by that album. I don't even own it myself.","When I was a kid, the idea of why I wanted acting to be the thing I do for the rest of my life was different. It was, Oh yeah, I'll get girls and be famous.","I've always liked women. But I don't want somebody who likes me because I'm famous. I like girls who are intelligent and who are kind of quiet like me.","I know a lot of people my age are still trying to figure out what to do, and I consider myself lucky that I can make a living doing something that I truly enjoy.","Jim Cameron used to call me 'Special Ed.'","I am very, very competitive and ambitious. I would definitely fight hard for a role I believed in.","I never thought I'd reach 21. I used to feel that was old, but growing old doesn't scare me anymore. I just want to have done something super special and have had someone to do it with.","By the time I'm old, I'm sure I'll have lived a full enough life. I think we're mortal for a reason. Life gets tiring, man!","I look up to actors. I look up to Robert DeNiro, I look up to Johnny Depp, I look up to Al Pacino, I look up to run-of-the-mill really good actors. I love watching movies, and I love watching other actors and learning from them."],"Edward G. Bulwer-Lytton":["In life, as in art, the beautiful moves in curves.","A good heart is better than all the heads in the world.","Power is so characteristically calm, that calmness in itself has the aspect of strength.","A fresh mind keeps the body fresh. Take in the ideas of the day, drain off those of yesterday. As to the morrow, time enough to consider it when it becomes today.","The pen is mightier than the sword.","When a person is down in the world, an ounce of help is better than a pound of preaching.","Love thou the rose, yet leave it on its stem.","A reform is a correction of abuses; a revolution is a transfer of power.","Be it jewel or toy, not the prize gives the joy, but the striving to win the prize.","Talent does what it can; genius does what it must.","A fool flatters himself, a wise man flatters the fool.","Dream manfully and nobly, and thy dreams shall be prophets.","It is not by the gray of the hair that one knows the age of the heart.","What mankind wants is not talent; it is purpose.","We tell our triumphs to the crowds, but our own hearts are the sole confidants of our sorrows.","There is nothing so agonizing to the fine skin of vanity as the application of a rough truth.","O be very sure That no man will learn anything at all, Unless he first will learn humility.","Beneath the rule of men entirely great, the pen is mightier than the sword.","Enthusiasm is the genius of sincerity and truth accomplishes no victories without it.","Truth makes on the ocean of nature no one track of light; every eye, looking on, finds its own.","How many of us have been attracted to reason; first learned to think, to draw conclusions, to extract a moral from the follies of life, by some dazzling aphorism.","There is nothing certain in a man's life but that he must lose it.","If thou be industrious to procure wealth, be generous in the disposal of it. Man never is so happy as when he giveth happiness unto another.","If you wish to be loved, show more of your faults than your virtues.","Anger ventilated often hurries towards forgiveness; anger concealed often hardens into revenge.","Remorse is the echo of a lost virtue.","The best teacher is the one who suggests rather than dogmatizes, and inspires his listener with the wish to teach himself.","Art and science have their meeting point in method.","Master books, but do not let them master you. Read to live, not live to read.","Chance happens to all, but to turn chance to account is the gift of few.","Whatever the number of a man's friends, there will be times in his life when he has one too few; but if he has only one enemy, he is lucky indeed if he has not one too many.","Happiness and virtue rest upon each other; the best are not only the happiest, but the happiest are usually the best.","I cannot love as I have loved, And yet I know not why; It is the one great woe of life To feel all feeling die.","In science, read, by preference, the newest works; in literature, the oldest. The classic literature is always modern.","Genius does what it must, and talent does what it can.","The easiest person to deceive is one's self.","There is no such thing as luck. It's a fancy name for being always at our duty, and so sure to be ready when good time comes.","Two lives that once part are as ships that divide.","The prudent person may direct a state, but it is the enthusiast who regenerates or ruins it.","The true spirit of conversation consists in building on another man's observation, not overturning it.","What ever our wandering our happiness will always be found within a narrow compass, and in the middle of the objects more immediately within our reach.","Every man who observes vigilantly and resolves steadfastly grows unconsciously into genius.","Refuse to be ill. Never tell people you are ill; never own it to yourself. Illness is one of those things which a man should resist on principle at the onset.","What is past is past, there is a future left to all men, who have the virtue to repent and the energy to atone.","One of the sublimest things in the world is plain truth.","One of the surest evidences of friendship that one individual can display to another is telling him gently of a fault. If any other can excel it, it is listening to such a disclosure with gratitude, and amending the error.","No author ever drew a character consistent to human nature, but he was forced to ascribe to it many inconsistencies."],"Edward G. Robinson":["I know I'm not much on face value, but when it comes to stage value, I'll deliver for you.","I didn't play at collecting. No cigar anywhere was safe from me.","My father and uncles and all their friends turned their lungs black trying to satisfy my collector's zeal.","In those days I would go for an interview and find myself competing with this other chap who would always be younger and taller, and much handsomer than I.","I had the advantage of reading the book, and when the script was first submitted to me, it was just another gangster story - the east side taking over the west side and all that.","Things got so bad that when I went shopping for a house, some people would refuse to open the door if they saw it was me standing there. And drunks would always want to challenge me."],"Edward Gibbon":["Our work is the presentation of our capabilities.","The winds and the waves are always on the side of the ablest navigators.","Revenge is profitable, gratitude is expensive.","I never make the mistake of arguing with people for whose opinions I have no respect.","Corruption, the most infallible symptom of constitutional liberty.","Books are those faithful mirrors that reflect to our mind the minds of sages and heroes.","The various modes of worship which prevailed in the Roman world were all considered by the people as equally true; by the philosopher as equally false; and by the magistrate as equally useful.","Every man who rises above the common level has received two educations: the first from his teachers; the second, more personal and important, from himself.","The laws of probability, so true in general, so fallacious in particular.","Fanaticism obliterates the feelings of humanity.","History is little more than the register of the crimes, follies, and misfortunes of mankind.","History is indeed little more than the register of the crimes, follies, and misfortunes of mankind.","The principles of a free constitution are irrecoverably lost, when the legislative power is nominated by the executive.","The courage of a soldier is found to be the cheapest and most common quality of human nature.","But the power of instruction is seldom of much efficacy, except in those happy dispositions where it is almost superfluous.","It has always been my practice to cast a long paragraph in a single mould, to try it by my ear, to deposit it in my memory, but to suspend the action of the pen till I had given the last polish to my work.","Hope, the best comfort of our imperfect condition.","We improve ourselves by victories over ourselves. There must be contest, and we must win.","Unprovided with original learning, unformed in the habits of thinking, unskilled in the arts of composition, I resolved to write a book.","Conversation enriches the understanding, but solitude is the school of genius.","My English text is chaste, and all licentious passages are left in the decent obscurity of a learned language.","Of the various forms of government which have prevailed in the world, an hereditary monarchy seems to present the fairest scope for ridicule.","The end comes when we no longer talk with ourselves. It is the end of genuine thinking and the beginning of the final loneliness.","In every deed of mischief he had a heart to resolve, a head to contrive, and a hand to execute.","I am indeed rich, since my income is superior to my expenses, and my expense is equal to my wishes.","My early and invincible love of reading I would not exchange for all the riches of India.","The author himself is the best judge of his own performance; none has so deeply meditated on the subject; none is so sincerely interested in the event.","The pathetic almost always consists in the detail of little events.","Our sympathy is cold to the relation of distant misery.","All that is human must retrograde if it does not advance.","I understand by this passion the union of desire, friendship, and tenderness, which is inflamed by a single female, which prefers her to the rest of her sex, and which seeks her possession as the supreme or the sole happiness of our being.","I was never less alone than when by myself.","Style is the image of character.","The style of an author should be the image of his mind, but the choice and command of language is the fruit of exercise.","Beauty is an outward gift which is seldom despised, except by those to whom it has been refused.","Their poverty secured their freedom, since our desires and our possessions are the strongest fetters of despotism.","Let us read with method, and propose to ourselves an end to which our studies may point. The use of reading is to aid us in thinking."],"Edward Gorey":["Life is intrinsically, well, boring and dangerous at the same time. At any given moment the floor may open up. Of course, it almost never does; that's what makes it so boring.","To take my work seriously would be the height of folly.","I just kind of conjured them up out of my subconscious and put them in order of ascending peculiarity.","I realize that homosexuality is a serious problem for anyone who is - but then, of course, heterosexuality is a serious problem for anyone who is, too.

The analytical part of my mind never quite let go.","I'd love to do some new plays.","It's amazing. I can't believe how brilliant the whole thing is - my daughter, Georgia, is just wonderful.","Normally, an actress has to work to bring out her male side. In our case, the dynamic is reversed. The actor playing her modelled himself on Sharon Stone.","Oh, come off it, I've only directed three plays for the RSC.","Shakespeare reveals human nature brilliantly: he shines a light on our instinctive desire to dominate each other.","Theatre is about people, not buildings. Incalculable damage has been done to the expert talent a company needs - from wardrobe to lighting technicians.","We felt that although they were patchy, there was a tremendous political energy in the Henry plays.","We have cut the text, but what remains are Shakespeare's words.","While trying to protect the republic, the conspirators in Julius Caesar enable Mark Antony to triumph.

The sound of a great engine, the unity and uniqueness of an automobile's engineering and coachwork, the history of the company and the car, and, of course, the sheer beauty of the thing.","I'm an actor. I'll take a lead if it's offered. The really good actors can fill a character, no matter what the role is. A good leading man is a character actor; a good character actor can be a leading man.","I like sunny stories. You know, my favorite girls in the '50s were Debbie Reynolds, Doris Day, and Esther Williams.","I thought cars were essential ingredients of life itself.","Growing up as a kid in Detroit, way back, there was a movie station that would show old kinescope reproductions of old movies, and I remember seeing Bela Lugosi for the first time and being duly frightened out of my wits.","How many times can you play an action character, or a quirky romantic? Every actor has to find his own way to make each character unique.","I remember seeing the first Astaire-Rogers musical on television, and I couldn't believe how beautiful it was. It dawned on me that you don't have to wear a cowboy hat to be a man.","I think it's much richer and much more fun to be an artist than to be anything else. I can't think of a better life than acting.","Actors are always grabbing each other on stage, looking in each other's eyes, making a moment so private, the audience doesn't know what they're doing.","The French suffered such catastrophic losses in the First World War. It really was the end of them as a great world power, although they, quote, 'won.'","You ingest the automobile in the very air of Detroit. Or at least you did in the 1940s and 1950s."],"Edward Hirsch":["Rhythm is sound in motion. It is related to the pulse, the heartbeat, the way we breathe. It rises and falls. It takes us into ourselves; it takes us out of ourselves.","Daydreaming is one of the key sources of poetry - a poem often starts as a daydream that finds its way into language - and walking seems to bring a different sort of alertness, an associative kind of thinking, a drifting state of mind.","Someone who's awake in the middle of the night is a soul consciousness when everyone else is asleep, and that creates a feeling of solitude in poetry that I very much like.","The Portuguese and Galician term 'saudade' suggests a profoundly bittersweet nostalgia.","Poetry takes courage because you have to face things and you try to articulate how you feel.","The elegy does the work of mourning; it allows us to experience mortality. It turns loss into remembrance, and it delivers an inheritance.","I think ancient cultures incorporated death into the experience of life in a more natural way than we have done. In our obsessive focus on youth, on celebrity, our denial of death makes it harder for people who are grieving to find a place for that grief.","James Salter is a consummate storyteller. His manners are precise and elegant; he has a splendid New York accent; he runs his hands through his gray hair and laughs boyishly.","I'd say people do need some help with poetry because I think poetry just helps takes us to places that Americans aren't always accustomed to going.","You're trying to write about something that's sacred. You're trying to bring the seriousness of life and death to it, and you're trying to find a way to dramatize it, and you're trying to give language to it, which is inadequate. But it's important to try.","Our culture has become increasingly intolerant of that acute sorrow, that intense mental anguish and deep remorse which may be defined as grief. We want to medicate such sorrow away.","I love the leisurely amplitude, the spaciousness, of taking a walk, of heading somewhere, anywhere, on foot. I love the sheer adventure of it: setting out and taking off.","The idea of how to read a poem is based on the idea that poetry needs you as a reader. That the experience of poetry, the meaning in poetry, is a kind of circuit that takes place between a poet, a poem and a reader, and that meaning doesn't exist or inhere in poems alone.","As far as I'm concerned, freedom is the most important thing to creativity. You should feel free to write in whatever way, whatever language, feels comfortable to you.","The terms of poetry - some simple, some complicated, some ancient, some new - should bring us closer to what we're hearing, enlarging our experience of it, enabling us to describe what we're reading, to feel and think with greater precision.","The line is a way of framing poetry. All verse is measured by lines. The poetic line immediately announces its difference from everyday speech and prose.","Each book should be an entity unto itself, with its own structure, character, life, name.","Poetry takes place in time. It is a durational. Things take place in sequence.","Throughout his work, Philip Levine's most powerful commitment has been to the failed and lost, the marginal, the unloved, the unwanted.","I've been fascinated over the years by the way refrains work. Think, say, of the refrains in Yeats' ballads. Ideally, each time the refrain comes back in a poem, it is both the same and different. It works by counterpoint and reiteration. It accrues meaning.","I'm a poet, and I spent my life in poetry.","As soon as something happens to us in America, everyone begins talking about healing. But before you heal, you have to mourn.","One of the things that happens to everyone who is grief-stricken, who has lost someone, is there comes a time when everyone else just wants you to get over it, but of course you don't get over it. You get stronger; you try and live on; you endure; you change; but you don't get over it. You carry it with you.","Depression is a feeling without a cause. Mourning has a cause.","Anyone who has lost a child will tell you that they don't recover their sense of endless possibility. Some people hide that well. But after a certain age, almost everyone is carrying something like that around, I suppose.","You're shadowed by your own dream, especially as you get older, of trying to create something that will last in poetry. And so, you're working on its behalf.","There have always been great defenses of poetry, and I've tried to write mine, and I think all of my work and criticism is a defense of poetry to try and keep something alive in poetry.","When I taught at the University of Houston in the Creative Writing program, we required the poets to take workshops in fiction writing, and we required the fiction writers to take workshops in poetry.","When I was young, I wrote everything, and I thought I would be an all around writer, that I would write everything.","A novel takes place over time. It's a historical narrative, and it needs to have a series of peaks and valleys and the move through. You can't just start at the highest pitch and stay there, but you can in a lyric poem.","I don't think you can read poetry while you're watching television very well.","The idea of a poem as a message in a bottle means that it's sent out towards some future reader, and the reader who opens that bottle becomes the addressee of the literary text.","My focus is on the reader and that the poet's job is not to inspire himself or herself. The poet's job is to inspire some future reader.","There's never been a culture without poetry in the history of the world.","In every culture, in every language, there is expressive play, expressive word play; there's language use to different purposes that we would call poetry.","I don't think poetry will die, but I think that poetry does demand a certain kind of attention to language. It does demand a certain space in order to read it, and I think that space is somewhat threatened by the lack of attention that people have and the amount of time that they give to things.","The very good thing about MFA programs is their democratizing. They bring a lot of different people to the table.","A person who's only suffering can't write a poem. There are choices to be made, and you need to be objective.","I had feelings that I didn't know what to do with, and I felt better when I started writing them. I thought of it as poetry. I did notice girls really liked it. Better than football. They liked the combination.","I began to imitate what I was reading, and I started to become a poet, even though what I was writing were not good poems.","I found a comfort in trying to solve some poetic problems because there were human ones I just couldn't solve.","The commitment to working at poetry is important because a poet is a maker, and a poem is a made thing. We have to honor our feelings by working to transform them into something meaningful and lasting.","I find great consolation in having a lot of poetry books around. I believe that writing poetry and reading it are deeply intertwined. I've always delighted in the company of the poets I've read.","I come from Chicago, and the landscape of the Midwest has always meant a great deal to me.","There's something really unnatural about losing a child, and there's something unnatural about having to write an elegy for your child, but I felt that I wanted people to know what he was like.","As long as there's been poetry, there have been lamentations.","Poetry is a form of necessary speech... I have sought to restore the aura of sacred practice that accompanies true poetic creation, to honor both the rational and the irrational elements of poetry.","Life has to have the plenitude of art.","Poetry is meant to inspire readers and listeners, to connect them more deeply to themselves even as it links them more fully to others. But many people feel put off by the terms of poetry, its odd vocabulary, its notorious difficulty.","There are still many tribal cultures where poetry and song, there is just one word for them. There are other cultures with literacy where poetry and song are distinguished. But poetry always remembers that it has its origins in music.","The sense of flowing, which is so crucial to song, is also crucial to poetry.","When poetry separates from song, then the words have to carry all the rhythm themselves; they have to do all the work. They can't rely on the singing voice.","One of the things that distinguishes poetry from ordinary speech is that in a very few number of words, poetry captures some kind of deep feeling, and rhythm is the way to get there. Rhythm is the way the poetry carries itself.","It's very important to me to be an American poet, a Jewish poet, a poet who came of age in the 1960s.","You are always trying to make something that is more than the sum of its parts.","My cultural experiences were as important to my formation as many of the other things that happened to me.","There are a lot of poems where I am questing for God. I don't think there is any finding of God.","I still feel that I'm capable of being as emotionally present as when I was young.","I believe in rooting poems in actual places, even if you move into some other extraordinary realm.","I started writing poetry as a teenager in suburban Chicago out of emotional desperation.","Poems mesmerized me, and I felt better when I was writing them, or trying to - more in touch with something deep and dark within myself.","I grew up in a middle-class house without books, without art. No one around me wrote poetry or even read it.","The sole literary presence from my childhood was my grandfather, a Jewish immigrant from Latvia, who eccentrically copied poems into the backs of his books. After he died, when I was 8 years old, my grandmother gave his books away, and his poems were lost.","Poetry itself hasn't been well served by poets who fled to the margins.","I aspire to a poetry of great formal integrity, deep passion and high intellect, and I have many models for how to do that.","It's absolutely crucial to maintain my life as a poet.","The muse, the beloved, and duende are three ways of thinking of what is the source of poetry, and all three seem to me different names or different ways to think about something that is not entirely reasonable, not entirely subject to the will, not entirely rational.","I'm so happy to be an advocate for poetry.","I read a lot as a kid and in high school.","I didn't read poetry seriously until college, when I really began to devour it in a very intense way. I also discovered that a poet is a maker. Before that, I thought a poet was someone who wrote about his own experiences.","The idea that a poem was a made thing stayed with me, and I decided then that I wanted to be an artist, not just a diarist. So I put myself through a kind of apprenticeship in writing poetry, and I understood even then that my practice as a poet was deeply related to my reading.","Poets have always celebrated grief as one of the deepest human emotions.","Poetry is a vocation. It is not a career but a calling.","Writing poetry is such an intense experience that it helps to start the process in a casual or wayward frame of mind.","I like the machinery of poems, especially when they have human warmth.","'Liberty Brass' is a small machine that unfolds in a single unpunctuated wave, which is interrupted by the rotating sign, the refrain. Each part is meant to do its work in relentless progression.","Once your poems are completed, you send them into the world. You don't write for a coterie of other writers - you write for other human beings.","Fresh or changing conditions ferment fresh forms."],"Edward Hoagland":["In order to really enjoy a dog, one doesn't merely try to train him to be semi-human. The point of it is to open oneself to the possibility of becoming partly a dog.","Country people do not behave as if they think life is short; they live on the principle that it is long, and savor variations of the kind best appreciated if most days are the same.","The question of whether it's God's green earth is not at center stage, except in the sense that if so, one is reminded with some regularity that He may be dying.","City people try to buy time as a rule, when they can, whereas country people are prepared to kill time, although both try to cherish in their mind's eye the notion of a better life ahead.","Animals are stylized characters in a kind of old saga - stylized because even the most acute of them have little leeway as they play out their parts.","Like a kick in the butt, the force of events wakes slumberous talents.","Men greet each other with a sock on the arm, women with a hug, and the hug wears better in the long run.","Land of opportunity, land for the huddled masses where would the opportunity have been without the genocide of those Old Guard, bristling Indian tribes?","Many people have believed that they were Chosen, but none more baldly than the Texans.","There were periods during my childhood when I stammered so badly I couldn't talk at all.","When I was 18 I worked with the Ringling Brothers circus, taking care of menagerie animals. I used to rather deliberately risk my life with the big cats.","Black bears, though, are not fearsome. I encountered one on the road to my house in Vermont, alone at night. I picked up two stones just in case, but I wasn't afraid of him. I felt a hunter's exhilaration and a brotherly feeling.","Once I climbed into a mountain lion's cage and she bounded at me and put her paw on my face, but she kept her claws withdrawn.","A writer's work is to witness things."],"Edward Hopper":["What I wanted to do was to paint sunlight on the side of a house.","No amount of skillful invention can replace the essential element of imagination.","Great art is the outward expression of an inner life in the artist, and this inner life will result in his personal vision of the world.","Maybe I am not very human - what I wanted to do was to paint sunlight on the side of a house.","If you could say it in words there would be no reason to paint.","There is a sort of elation about sunlight on the upper part of a house.","Well, I've always been interested in approaching a big city in a train, and I can't exactly describe the sensations, but they're entirely human and perhaps have nothing to do with aesthetics.","If I had the energy, I would have done it all over the county.","The only real influence I've ever had was myself.","In general it can be said that a nation's art is greatest when it most reflects the character of its people.","I believe that the great painters with their intellect as master have attempted to force this unwilling medium of paint and canvas into a record of their emotions.","I find linseed oil and white lead the most satisfactory mediums.","My aim in painting has always been the most exact transcription possible of my most intimate impression of nature.","After all, we are not French and never can be, and any attempt to be so is to deny our inheritance and to try to impose upon ourselves a character that can be nothing but a veneer upon the surface.","I trust Winsor and Newton and I paint directly upon it.","If the technical innovations of the Impressionists led merely to a more accurate representation of nature, it was perhaps of not much value in enlarging their powers of expression.","In its most limited sense, modern, art would seem to concern itself only with the technical innovations of the period.","Painting will have to deal more fully and less obliquely with life and nature's phenomena before it can again become great.","The question of the value of nationality in art is perhaps unsolvable.","I find in working always the disturbing intrusion of elements not a part of my most interested vision, and the inevitable obliteration and replacement of this vision by the work itself as it proceeds.","I have tried to present my sensations in what is the most congenial and impressive form possible to me.","I think that zinc white has a property of scaling and cracking.","I use a retouching varnish which is made in France, Libert, and that's all the varnish I use.","If the picture needs varnishing later, I allow a restorer to do that, if there's any restoring necessary.","It's to paint directly on the canvas without any funny business, as it were, and I use almost pure turpentine to start with, adding oil as I go along until the medium becomes pure oil. I use as little oil as I can possibly help, and that's my method.","More of me comes out when I improvise.","The trend in some of the contemporary movements in art, but by no means all, seems to deny this ideal and to me appears to lead to a purely decorative conception of painting.","There will be, I think, an attempt to grasp again the surprise and accidents of nature and a more intimate and sympathetic study of its moods, together with a renewed wonder and humility on the part of such as are still capable of these basic reactions.","Well, I have a very simple method of painting."],"Edward Irving":["I perceive two things in Scotland of the most fearful omen: ignorance of theological truth, and a readiness to pride themselves in and boast of it.","The thing which grieves and oppresses my heart with respect to poor Scotland, is the hardness of heart manifest in the levity and cruelty with which they speak of others.","The state of my poor boy's health prevents me from leaving home for a night.","The Evangelical party in the Church of Scotland will lay all flat if they be not prevented.","I have thoroughly gone through the subject of the Incarnation; and if it served you, could at any time give you the history from the beginning of the controversies on this subject, and of its present form."],"Edward James Olmos":["I believe that Gandhi was correct. Non-violent civil disobedience is the only way to bring about change that allows people to enjoy the change and not get killed in the process.","Chiapas is probably the main concern I have right now for the planet.","I learned to discipline myself to do things I didn't want to do.","I support the indigenous people anywhere in the planet.","Success is a matter of one's own feeling about oneself.","A saint is a person who gives of themself without asking for anything in return. That's how simple it is to be a saint. Try it! Try being a saint.","There are nuclear weapons in China, Iran, Korea and Pakistan. It wouldn't take much to send a couple of warheads off on this planet somewhere that would cause a lot of environmental damage, then if you have got someone who wants to retaliate you have real problems.","Education is a vacine for violence.","There is no way that we know what is going on between the African American and the Asian American. We don't understand what an Indigenous American is. We don't understand what a Latino American is.","Because people of color will definitely, definitely become the power base in the Western Hemisphere.","I'm always pleased when people respond to the work.","Education is the vaccine for violence.","I don't support violence, period.","Our inability to relate to one another is very, very, very important. When we don't have it, we get situations like Bosnia.","You get more churches burned down in the United States in the last two years than in the last hundred, because of the lack of understanding of culture and diversity and the beauty of it.","Yeah, the New York Times is very intellectual and very, very prestigious, but it doesn't reach the market that People magazine does.","Education is the key. But it's the kind of education that we teach that is the key. We don't have it.","At the rate we're going, the 21st century looks pretty clear. It's going to be pretty violent.","Right now, the Anglo people are desperately trying to hold on to the United States, like they tried to hold on to Africa.","And, granted, for a long time, the European has been dominant in certain parts of this Western Hemisphere, but by the end of the 21st century, it's over.","You know, Hillary Clinton gives of herself. Princess Diana gave of herself. But they are not saints.","Basically, I think that there are some characters that you can just allow the truth of your character as a human being in your real life to come through.","Now I also discipline myself to do things I love to do when I don't want to do them.","I want to show how strong I am from my roots.","We don't have as much prejudice as we did 40 years ago, but today it is more educated.","I think in Vice and American Me I played very silent, rigid characters and people remember them.","And I've been acting for 39 years, so I define characters differently than I did in say Miami Vice.","I'm not prepared for holding office any more than I think Arnold is.","When you're asked to fly a 747 you better at least be able to fly a Piper cub.","The older you get the more you understand what you're doing.","I'm here to make sense.","Sometimes you gotta do things that you don't really want to do. But you don't do them for money.","I love to drive. It's one of the most pleasurable things to me.","I've been in the director's chair for 'Battlestar Galactica' since its first season. I directed the only comedy that's ever been done in Galactica history.","'Stand and Deliver' has been the most successful thing I have done in my life. So many people have seen it.

Abby will retain her role of President, and I will continue to serve as Chairman of the Board.","I would expect the family would continue to play a critical role in leading Fidelity. However, the company does not necessarily have to be run day-to-day by a family member. It will be run by the person who is determined to have the right skills and chemistry.","Fidelity does have a succession plan in place to ensure a smooth transition."],"Edward Kennedy":["The work goes on, the cause endures, the hope still lives and the dreams shall never die.","Integrity is the lifeblood of democracy.

I just mind that someone else is.","It's now clear that from the very moment President Bush took office, Iraq was his highest priority as unfinished business from the first Bush Administration. His agenda was clear: find a rationale to get rid of Saddam.","Shamefully we now learn that Saddam's torture chambers reopened under new management, U.S. management.","There was no imminent threat. This was made up in Texas, announced in January to the Republican leadership that war was going to take place and was going to be good politically. This whole thing was a fraud.","Thus, the controversy about the Moral Majority arises not only from its views, but from its name - which, in the minds of many, seems to imply that only one set of public policies is moral and only one majority can possibly be right.","Today, we say the only thing we have to fear is four more years of George Bush.","We want to support our troops because they didn't make the decision to go there... but I don't think it should be open-ended.

Some days we give in to weakness, and sometimes we give in to strength.","The humor and emotion of the 'Do You Want to Build a Snowman' theme makes me cry every time I watch it, and that deep emotion is something we'd love to do on the show.

And 'Once,' when it's at its best, is emotional and fun.","The thing with 'Peter Pan' is it's been done so well so many times.","'Frozen' is a phenomenon on an entirely new Disney scale.","Belief is so important in everything.

I love the idea that all the Lost Boys were orphans, and that they wanted Wendy to be their mom.","'Northern Exposure.' I loved that show; I loved the way it was able to have episodes where somebody finds a woolly mammoth, he calls the museum in New York, they send a guy out, and the mammoth's gone because someone ate it. To me, that was everything I ever wanted to do. That show mixed emotion, humor and the surreal all at once.","The 'Lost' pilot was wide enough and included enough things so that when Season Five came, and we spent half of the year in 1973, nobody cried foul.

Its commitment is to the way of reason.","The concept of reason itself appears as an artificial attempt to separate intellectual powers from the frustrations, emotions, and accidents which cause events; the concept of reason is viewed as facade to prevent change.","Law builds upon and, I should like to claim, is one of the liberal arts.

Westerns - gasp - describe the West. Techno-thriller readers expect to learn something about technology from their fiction.","Lots of science fiction deals with distant times and places. Intrepid prospectors in the Asteroid Belt. Interstellar epics. Galactic empires. Trips to the remote past or future.","The distinguishing characteristic of the techno-thriller is technical detail.","I like to think readers appreciate a well-drawn near-future as well as a well-drawn far-future.","What SF author or fan isn't interested in human space travel? I've yet to meet one.","I want to believe humanity has not forgotten how to explore.","I have to believe SF writers will continue to inspire the public to have faith in - to demand! - a future that is at least as big and bold as the past.","It would help if human experts agreed on the meaning of such basic terms as intelligence, consciousness, or awareness. They don't. It's hard to build something that's incompletely defined.","In mainstream literature, a trope is a figure of speech: metaphor, simile, irony, or the like. Words used other than literally. In SF, a trope - at least as I understand the usage - is more: science used other than literally.","Many a fine SF story uses science or technology merely as backdrop. Many a fine SF story presumes a technological breakthrough and explores its implications without attempting to predict how the thing might actual work.","The biggest fatal flaw in most fictional portrayals of nanotech - what sends those books arcing across the room - is ignoring that the nanobots need energy to do... anything.","I'm a physicist and computer scientist by training. I worked in high tech for thirty years as everything from engineer to senior vice president - for many of those years, writing SF as a hobby - until, in 2004, I began writing full time.","What kind of hard SF do I write? Everything from near-future, Earth-centric techno-thrillers to far-future, far-flung interstellar epics."],"Edward M. Purcell":["To see the world for a moment as something rich and strange is the private reward of many a discovery.","I remember, in the winter of our first experiments, just seven years ago, looking on snow with new eyes.","The Nobel Prize, so long regarded in our science as the highest reward a man's work can earn, must bring to its recipient a most solemn sense of his debt to his fellow scientists and those of the past."],"Edward McKendree Bounds":["The resurrection of Jesus Christ was necessary to establish the truth of his mission and put the stamp of all-conquering power on his gospel.","The most casual reader of the New Testament can scarcely fail to see the commanding position the resurrection of Christ holds in Christianity. It is the creator of its new and brighter hopes, of its richer and stronger faith, of its deeper and more exalted experience.","The houses of Heaven are God-built and are as enduring and incorruptible as their builder. We will have bodies after the resurrection; transfigured they will be after the model of Christ's glorious body.","The preacher's sharpest and strongest preaching should be to himself. His most difficult, delicate, laborious, and thorough work must be with himself.","The life-giving preacher is a man of God, whose heart is ever athirst for God, whose soul is ever following hard after God, whose eye is single to God, and in whom by the power of God's Spirit the flesh and the world have been crucified, and his ministry is like the generous flood of a life-giving river.","Woe to the generation of sons who find their censers empty of the rich incense of prayer, whose fathers have been too busy or too unbelieving to pray, and perils inexpressible and consequences untold are their unhappy heritage.","It must never be forgotten that Almighty God rules this world. He is not an absentee God.","Prayer is a specific divine appointment, an ordinance of Heaven, whereby God purposes to carry out His gracious designs on earth and to execute and make efficient the plan of salvation.","Preaching is God's great institution for the planting and maturing of spiritual life. When properly executed, its benefits are untold; when wrongly executed, no evil can exceed its damaging results.","The transfiguration of Jesus is one of the typical facts of the resurrection of the body; not only of the glorious change, but of the renewed life of the body and of the general judgment day.","Men of prayer, before anything else, are indispensable to the furtherance of the kingdom of God on earth. No other sort will fit in the scheme or do the deed. Men, great and influential in other things but small in prayer, cannot do the work Almighty God has set out for His Church to do in this, His world.","Prayer concerns God, whose purposes and plans are conditioned on prayer. His will and His glory are bound up in praying.","In the Bible, we have the facts and history of man's redemption. Incidentally or essentially, other worlds and other beings are brought prominently on the stage of redemption purposes and plans.","The Bible nowhere enters into an argument to prove the person and being of God. It assumes His being and reveals His person and character.","Bible revelations are not against reason but above reason, for the uses of faith, man's highest faculty.","A denial of the reality of demonical possessions on the part of anyone who believes the Gospel narrative to be true and inspired may justly be regarded as simply and plainly inconceivable.","Every preacher who does not make prayer a mighty factor in his own life and ministry is weak as a factor in God's work and is powerless to project God's cause in this world.","Faith accepts the Bible as the word and will of God and rests upon its truth without question and without other evidence.","The Scriptures bear ample and continuous evidence that the faith of the resurrection of the body lies in the faith that Jesus Christ died and rose again.","The more praying there is in the world, the better the world will be, the mightier the forces against evil everywhere.","It is only when the whole heart is gripped with the passion of prayer that the life-giving fire descends, for none but the earnest man gets access to the ear of God.","Man's access in prayer to God opens everything and makes his impoverishment his wealth. All things are his through prayer.","Faith can make no appeal to reason or the fitness of things; its appeal is to the Word of God, and whatever is therein revealed, faith accepts as true.","Christianity is not rationalism, but faith in God's revelation. A conspicuous, all-important item in that revelation is the resurrection of the body.","The strong argument for Heaven as a place centers in and clusters about Jesus. The man Jesus, bearing a man's form, the body He wore on earth, has a place assigned Him - a high place.","The glorified will not be pilgrims, transient visitors, or tenants at will, but settled, permanent, walled, established by title, through eternity by warrantee deed, signed, sealed, recorded, possession given. No renters, no lessees of Heaven, but all property and home owners.","Safety is in Heaven. Put your values there only; put your heart there. No tears are there to flood your heart, no sorrows there to break it, no losses there to grieve and embitter.","God's plan is to make much of the man, far more of him than of anything else. Men are God's method. The Church is looking for better methods; God is looking for better men.","The Holy Ghost does not flow through methods, but through men. He does not come on machinery, but on men. He does not anoint plans, but men - men of prayer.","The character as well as the fortunes of the gospel is committed to the preacher. He makes or mars the message from God to man. The preacher is the golden pipe through which the divine oil flows.","Preaching is not the performance of an hour. It is the outflow of a life. It takes twenty years to make a sermon because it takes twenty years to make the man. The true sermon is a thing of life. The sermon grows because the man grows.","We may excuse the spiritual poverty of our preaching in many ways, but the true secret will be found in the lack of urgent prayer for God's presence in the power of the Holy Spirit.","The preachers who gain mighty results for God are the men who have prevailed in their pleadings with God ere venturing to plead with men.","When we say that prayer puts God to work, it is simply to say that man has it in his power by prayer to move God to work in His own way among men, in which way He would not work if prayer was not made.","If prayer puts God to work on earth, then, by the same token, prayerlessness rules God out of the world's affairs and prevents Him from working.","Prayer lays hold upon God and influences Him to work. This is the meaning of prayer as it concerns God. This is the doctrine of prayer, or else there is nothing whatever in prayer.","Nothing is more important to God than prayer in dealing with mankind. But it is likewise all-important to man to pray.","The life of the individual believer, his personal salvation, and personal Christian graces have their being, bloom and fruitage in prayer.","While the pulpit must hold to its unswerving loyalty to the Word of God, it must, at the same time, be loyal to the doctrine of prayer which that same Word illustrates and enforces upon mankind.","Men who pray are, in reality, the only religious men, and it takes a full-measured man to pray.","In doing God's work, there is no substitute for praying. The men of prayer cannot be displaced with other kinds of men.","The men to whom Jesus Christ committed the fortunes and destiny of His Church were men of prayer. To no other kind of men has God ever committed Himself in this world.","Prayer-leadership preserves the spirituality of the Church, just as prayerless leaders make for unspiritual conditions.","Leaders in the realm of religious activity are to be judged by their praying habits and not by their money or social position. Those who must be placed in the forefront of the Church's business must be, first of all, men who know how to pray.","In all God's plans for human redemption, He proposes that men pray. The men are to pray in every place, in the church, in the closet, in the home, on sacred days and on secular days.","The sanctity of prayer is needed to impregnate business. We need the spirit of Sunday carried over to Monday and continued until Saturday. But this cannot be done by prayerless men, but by men of prayer.","Praying men are God's agents on earth, the representative of government of Heaven, set to a specific task on the earth.","We are feeble, weak and impoverished because of our failure to pray. God is restrained in doing because we are restrained by reason of our non-praying. All failures in securing heaven are traceable to lack of prayer or misdirected petition.","Prayer must be broad in its scope - it must plead for others. Intercession for others is the hallmark of all true prayer. When prayer is confined to self and to the sphere of one's personal needs, it dies by reason of its littleness, narrowness and selfishness."],"Edward Moore":["I think when you're blessed with great influences, you need to spread it.","'Tis now the summer of your youth: time has not cropped the roses from your cheek, though sorrow long has washed them.","Time, still as he flies, adds increase to her truth, and gives to her mind what he steals from her youth.","I am rich beyond the dreams of avarice.","Ay, rail at gaming - 'tis a rich topic, and affords noble declamation. Go, preach against it in the city - you'll find a congregation in every tavern."],"Edward N. Ney":["A sense of style can be sort of fun, as long as it doesn't get in the way.","I can do whatever I want, because my career is a certain thing.","I know exactly what I want to buy and I spend very little time, maybe 15 hours a year, buying stuff. I'll go in and out of Dunhill in 45 minutes and pick out a few suits. Boom. And I'm gone. I get my shirts at Charvet. I go in there - woosh - and buy 12 shirts and some ties; once a year and that's it.","If you see a man who is so obviously impressed with his own appearance, then you wonder what his priorities are."],"Edward Norton":["I've always thought of acting as more of an exercise in empathy, which is not to be confused with sympathy. You're trying to get inside a certain emotional reality or motivational reality and try to figure out what that's about so you can represent it.","It's better for people to miss you than to have seen too much of you.","Duality is not a story. Duality is just a complexity.","Life, like poker has an element of risk. It shouldn't be avoided. It should be faced.","Instead of telling the world what you're eating for breakfast, you can use social networking to do something that's meaningful.","The more you can create that magic bubble, that suspension of disbelief, for a while, the better.","I almost forgot what it's like to be proud of my government.","I don't smoke and I don't want to smoke. I am not a fan of gratuitous smoking in films.","I'm fascinated by the ways in which people express themselves, because their responses are often counter to what they're actually feeling. Like when they're frightened, they tend to freeze. When they're angry, it doesn't always come out as volume. There are wonderful contradictions in the way that people express their emotions.","I like it when the deeper you go with the character, the more you see the layers start to peel away.","All people are paradoxical. No one is easily reducible, so I like characters who have contradictory impulses or shades of ambiguity. It's fun, and it's fun because it's hard.","A lot of why I do something is just the novelty of the experience.","Every little thing that people know about you as a person impedes your ability to achieve that kind of terrific suspension of disbelief that happens when an audience goes with an actor and character he's playing.","If I ever have to stop taking the subway, I'm gonna have a heart attack.","I tend to have a kind of tunnel vision when I'm looking at an individual piece.","The best films of any kind, narrative or documentary, provoke questions.","I just like working with smart people.","I don't get much out of doing a red carpet.","I don't have anything to prove to anybody, which is a lovely place to be.","When you're working on a creative thing, everyone has an idea, and they're pushing it. The first time you work with anybody, you have to get comfortable with the way another person pushes hard for what they want.","Identical twins are endemically alike in many ways.","It's dismaying to see the unilateralism that the government is doing.","I always felt that acting was an escape, like having the secret key to every door and permission to go into any realm and soak it up. I enjoy that free pass.","Look, you've got a generation of people coming along who are going to form their own new relationship with the idea of supporting the causes that they care about or changing the world. And these people are not going to do it the way our parents do it.","I never think that a film should answer questions for you. I think it should make you ask a lot of questions.","Just because you've made a couple movies, you've done some good movies, you've been nominated for some Academy Awards, whatever, nobody's entitled. It's a business. If they don't see it, I can think they're wrong, but I'm not entitled to a $15 million budget to make a film.","You never make all things for all people and can't always pander to the broadest denominator. I keep an eye toward doing the themes that interest me. Do they move me? Interest me? Make me think? When I run across something that is provocative in an unsettling way, it appeals to me.","Anybody who is running a marathon or doing a walkathon, doing a fundraiser for their school, their company, by far it's guaranteed the easiest and most fun way to quickly set up a fundraising campaign and send it around to your friends and family.","Well, I don't feel that I've played so many bad guys, and I'm rot really drawn to villains per se. I think a lot of people relate to some of my characters' inner struggles.","The film industry needs to confront the physical footprint of the way films get made.","Fame is very corrosive and you have to guard very strictly against it.","I do find myself drawn more to pieces that I feel are wrestling with the way that we're living now, what we're all going through.","People wrestle sometimes making movies, and I think that conflict is a very essential thing. I think a lot of very happy productions have produced a lot of very banal movies.","I have this embedded faith in the process through which films of a certain type get discovered on longer timelines.","Most of the films that I've ever really responded to are ones that I feel were really involved in their times.","I think we really feel like Crowdrise could be something that, 20 years from now, people take for granted because that's just how you do it, like if you're going to raise money for something, that's how you do it.","I get heartbroken flying into L.A. It's just this feeling of unspecific loss. Can you imagine what the San Fernando Valley was when it was all wheat fields? Can you imagine what John Steinbeck saw?","My generation is having its midlife crisis in its 20s.","When I'm the one who sits down and looks at the blank page and writes it out all the way, then I'll call it my script.","You know, independent films have been institutionalized, practically. Every studio has got a boutique arthouse label.","I like making movies for myself and my friends and people with my sensibility.","I grew up on the golden age of children's TV.","No, I'm not a very methodologically pure actor.","There's a lot of romanticisation of the intuitive actor and method acting and all kinds of notions about getting inside a character and coming out from there.","I'm a New Yorker, you know.","If I'm trying to put size on for a role, then I don't do much running.","You always end up getting involved in things because of, you know, the strange things your life brings you into contact with.","Basically, I think 21st century conservation is moving toward preserving ecosystems by dealing with the needs of people.","Everyone keeps saying the western's dead, but it's not.","The period western doesn't have a lot to say to most people today.","I read a lot of scripts and so many are clearly a knockoff of one familiar genre or another.","In drama, I think, the audience is a willing participant. It's suspending a certain kind of disbelief to try to get something out of a story.","It's a dream to be in a company of actors.","People are worried about the degree to which corporate interest is starting to threaten human interest.","At this point in my life I'm not bent on proving anything, really.","I've always liked the idea of taking old dramatic ideas and devices and making them feel relevant or contemporary or whatever.","If you've got a piece and you can feel the person who's going to direct it is really made for it, if it's really special for them, then it's going to be a better-than-usual experience.","It's nice when someone knows their lines.","I think a lot of people in their average day actually imagine two sides of a conversation at one point or another. I think that the mental trick of holding two sides of a conversation in your head is actually something that we all do.","I think a lot of people relate to some of my characters' inner struggles.","Young people know how to use these social networking tools, and they know how to use them effectively.","I like music, but I need to get outside more.","I tend to relate to a character in terms of the arc: what's interesting is where he starts versus where he ends up.","I remember as a kid having the offer of a scholarship, that it was going to be like going to Mars, and deciding to stay in my public school.","The people who work in the scientific field, they need help to convey what it's about.","I don't flatter myself - I'm not a scientist, I'm not a conservation expert.","I like things that aren't superficially one thing or another.","I'm not particularly precious about the theatrical experience any more.","I just love movies.","You can't control everything that comes to you."],"Edward P. Jones":["In journalism, a fact is just a fact. But in fiction, you have to build your case. It has to be made, step by step.","I have said with as much sincerity as I can muster that if I were thrown into a dungeon with a sentence of one hundred years, with my only company being an illiterate guard who came twice a day with meals but who never spoke, I would still write - on coarse toilet paper in the dark if I could spare it.","At first I read mostly books by Southern authors - black and white - because almost all the people I knew were born and raised in the South, starting with my mother. I remember I got a lot of Erskine Caldwell.","My father was Catholic, and my mother wanted me to go to Catholic school. That's what I did in first grade. But she couldn't afford the payments. I think it must have hurt her a lot, not to be able to give me a Catholic education.","My mother relied on her memory to do things because she couldn't read. Part of that was not really knowing numbers.","I don't want to own something that you can't take into your apartment at night.","I don't believe that there is any particular book that influenced any 'career' I might have.","Perhaps if I knew I would be stranded on an island with but one book, I would choose the Bible. For no religious reason whatsoever, but because of the varieties of stories, which might be useful as the days pass.","'Jane Eyre,' when I think of that book, it conjures up the best moments of college English courses. Literature is extraordinary, especially when you have a good professor.","I write a lot in my head. I've never been driven to write things down.","I'm not afraid of my own company. I was made to be at home.","The people I grew up around, almost all of them had been born and raised in the South. And, you know, they didn't always go to church, but they lived their lives as if God were watching everything they did.","It just so happens that I was born and raised in Washington. Had I been born in Chicago or San Antonio, the streets and places would have figured into whatever I wrote. Just so happens that it's Washington, D.C.","In the summer of 1964, my sister and I went to South Ballston, Virginia, to stay with my aunt and her kids. They passed the civil rights bill that summer; my cousins were so happy because now they could swim in the pool.","From my apartment in Arlington, I could see Washington. It was always nice to be near home.","I've never been comfortable with the idea of using family and friends in stories. Which is why it takes me longer than something else. Because you make them up out of nothing. Doing that is harder.","People seem to have trouble with the imagination. They can't believe that you can just pull things out of your brain like that.","I never like to put myself in the stories; in 'Lost in the City,' there are fourteen stories, and there's only one, 'The First Day,' about a little girl going to school, that has anything to do with me.","My mother worked in the white world, but I lived almost exclusively in a black world. I don't think I had ever seen a white teacher until I got to high school.","Those of us with this ancient compulsion to tell stories sometimes start with a single kernel of something.","There are those who write because they believe they have something so marvelous that it will make them famous and wealthy, a lauded commodity who will be invited to a lifetime of cocktail parties.","Something happened during the 1980s - perhaps the political climate of that time - that caused me to ask how a people would become part of a system that oppresses their own people.","When you grow up with a mother who has to wash dishes and clean hotel rooms, you know the importance of having a job, and you can't be without a job for any length of time, or you will be without anything.","You don't go to the library and walk along and pick out a topic. You are riding the bus, or shopping at Safeway, and all of a sudden the idea comes to you."],"Edward R. Murrow":["Good night, and good luck.","Anyone who isn't confused really doesn't understand the situation.","To be persuasive we must be believable; to be believable we must be credible; credible we must be truthful.","We must not confuse dissent with disloyalty. When the loyal opposition dies, I think the soul of America dies with it.","We cannot make good news out of bad practice.","Just because your voice reaches halfway around the world doesn't mean you are wiser than when it reached only to the end of the bar.","Our major obligation is not to mistake slogans for solutions.","A reporter is always concerned with tomorrow. There's nothing tangible of yesterday. All I can say I've done is agitate the air ten or fifteen minutes and then boom - it's gone.","Difficulty is the excuse history never accepts.","Senator McCarthy's reckless and unfounded attempt to impugn my loyalty is just one more example of his typical tactic of attempting to tie up to Communism anyone who disagrees with him.","A satellite has no conscience.","The obscure we see eventually. The completely obvious, it seems, takes longer.","Most truths are so naked that people feel sorry for them and cover them up, at least a little bit.","No one can terrorize a whole nation, unless we are all his accomplices.","Everyone is a prisoner of his own experiences. No one can eliminate prejudices - just recognize them.","I have an old-fashioned belief that Americans like to make up their own minds on the basis of all available information.","People say conversation is a lost art; how often I have wished it were.","Just once in a while let us exalt the importance of ideas and information.","We cannot defend freedom abroad by deserting it at home.","If we were to do the Second Coming of Christ in color for a full hour, there would be a considerable number of stations which would decline to carry it on the grounds that a Western or a quiz show would be more profitable.","The speed of communications is wondrous to behold. It is also true that speed can multiply the distribution of information that we know to be untrue.","The newest computer can merely compound, at speed, the oldest problem in the relations between human beings, and in the end the communicator will be confronted with the old problem, of what to say and how to say it.","The politician in my country seeks votes, affection and respect, in that order. With few notable exceptions, they are simply men who want to be loved.","If you believe that this war will be decided on the home front, then you must believe that radio used as an instrument of war is one of the most powerful weapons a nation possesses.","Fame is morally neutral."],"Edward Ruscha":["Traveling is irritating to me, but not driving. Going to the airport makes me nervous, but when I set out to just take a leisurely drive, it's blue skies and puffy clouds and time.","Basically everything I've done in art, I was in possession of when I was 20 years old. I use a waste retrieval method of working. I'll go back and use something that disgusted me 15 years ago but that I had enough sense to think about. Some artists change dramatically. I see my work more like history being written.","I'm interested in glorifying something that we in the world would say doesn't deserve being glorified. Something that's forgotten, focused on as though it were some sort of sacred object.","I travel a lot, but I don't come away with new inspiration.","All my artistic response comes from American things, and I guess I've always had a weakness for heroic imagery.","I wasn't captivated by the romance of Paris or London. I love visiting, but I'd rather be in L.A.","I don't do social media of any kind. If I did, I may as well join Scientology.","My friends and neighbors were always fixing their cars. Soldiers who felt restless wanted to work on something, and they understood cars. Me, I like to look at cars but I was never really a mechanic.","The one thing I miss is hitchhiking. Now there's no more of that. When's the last time you saw a hitchhiker? It's not that I consider it a great sport, but it was my way of seeing the country. The open road, especially in the western United States, is still very pristine, but everything else around it has changed.","I barely knew I wanted to be an artist. I liked my art classes and painting was fun, I guess, but I didn't realize that seeing the country was going to inspire me to further explore that... but that's what it did.","I have no social agenda with my work. I'm deadpan about it.","Work takes different forms. I can spend two or three days without completing anything, and it's choppy: it's filled with all kinds of irrationalities and stupid actions. I have some notion, and then I drop it because something else comes along. I'm forever darting from one side of the room to the other.","I knew I wanted to be some kind of artist from about 12. I met a neighbour who drew cartoons, and I had an idea I wanted to be a cartoonist - or something that involved Indian ink, at any rate.","I'd read about Los Angeles and this fact stuck in my mind: that the city gained 1,000 new people every day. In 1956! A thousand people every day! I felt: 'I want to be part of that.'","The big pay-off was to work as an artist and gain some shred of respect from your friends, who were also artists. But there was never any notion that you could make a living out of art. On the rare occasions you had a gallery show, and sold a little work, well, that was just gravy.","Traveling to Europe and traveling in the U.S.A. was a much different experience. 'On the Road' exemplified everything glamorous that was happening on this side of the planet. The book puts off some kind of sweet melody - part hope for the world, part nostalgic.","The difference between psychedelia and digitalia ages will seem like a smooth blending in years to come and will be a mere blip on the screen.","I don't watch TV, so I feel like I'm left out of the American fabric or something.","People refuse to believe that I've never been to Starbucks or Disneyland.","When you're on a highway, viewing the western U.S. with the mountains and the flatness and the desert and all that, it's very much like my paintings.","I was attracted to the concept of Hollywood and the lifestyle here. But I've grown to mistrust it because it has changed. I didn't bargain for digital access parking in some concrete structure. Real heaven for me was to drive somewhere and park right in front. Now the city is going vertical.","When I paint a picture of a house, that goes back to my roots.","As an artist, I gotta stand up to my own work.","When I drive, I check out everything I see, and just taking in all those observations helps me think. So I draw and write a lot as I drive, and I know that's dangerous, but I manage to do it off to the side, with my notes on the seat.","I'm very stodgy. I'm always looking at old photos of California and Los Angeles, knowing that what I'm looking at is now full of houses. There used to be vacant lots in Los Angeles, now all taken up by three-storey boxes - it's all getting infilled.","I was raised with the Bible Belt mentality, and by coming to California, I came out of this dark place and unlearned a lot of things I'd been taught.","Part of ego is displaying the ego. I've got ego, and I think I'm really good. But maybe I fall down in trying to sell it to people."],"Edward Rutherfurd":["Writing historical novels can be dangerous. We need to be as accurate and as fair about the historical record as we can be, at the same time as creating our fictional characters and, hopefully, telling a good story. The challenge is weaving the fiction into the history.","I descend from both Philadelphia Quakers and Carolina colonists whose families were separated by the Revolutionary War. That helped give me insight into the agony of Patriots who, until the British government denied their claims, had always, like Ben Franklin himself, thought of themselves as free-born Englishmen.","Paris. City of love. City of dreams. City of splendor. City of saints and scholars. City of gaiety. Sink of iniquity.","For centuries my father's family lived on Britain's biggest tidal river, the Severn, on which there was a huge trade with the interior, and through the Port of Bristol with America.","I myself was born beside a river - the Avon in Sarum. So when I first encountered New York's great harbor and the Hudson River as a teenager, and came to understand their historic canal and railroad links to the vast spaces of the Midwest, I felt both the thrill of a new adventure and a deep sense of homecoming.","I first considered writing 'New York' in 1991. I'd been in the city for a decade, was married to an American wife, and sending my children to New York schools. I was even on the board of a coop building. But I wasn't sure how to organize such complex material, and for many years I put the project aside.","For novelists, the imagination is everything. The trick is to guide one's imagination using research. I love using old maps. When I wrote my novels on London and New York, I found wonderful historical atlases. Paris has the most lavish maps of all.","For me, playing music while I write is important. Several of the romantic scenes in 'Paris' were written with Debussy's 'String Quartet,' his 'L'Apres-midi d'une Faune,' or Canteloube's 'Songs of the Auvergne' playing in the background.","All of my career has been an attempt to educate myself and get paid for it."],"Edward Said":["Since the time of Homer every European, in what he could say about the Orient, was a racist, an imperialist, and almost totally ethnocentric.","The inner me was always under attack by authority, by the way my parents wanted me to be brought up, by these English schools I went to. So I've always felt this kind of anti-authoritarian strain in me, pushing to express itself despite the obstacles.","I have been unable to live an uncommitted or suspended life. I have not hesitated to declare my affiliation with an extremely unpopular cause.","I don't myself believe in a two-state solution. I believe in a one-state solution.","Until the June 1967 war I was completely caught up in the life of a young professor of English. Beginning in 1968, I started to think, write, and travel as someone who felt himself to be directly involved in the renaissance of Palestinian life and politics.","I was one of the first people in the Palestinian world, in the late 1970s, to say that there is no military option, either for us or for them, and I'm certainly the only well-known Arab who writes these things - and who writes exactly the same things in the Arab press that I say here.","When you become a public figure, you still think, 'That's really not me; there's more to me than that.'"],"Edward Sapir":["No important national language, at least in the Occidental world, has complete regularity of grammatical structure, nor is there a single logical category which is adequately and consistently handled in terms of linguistic symbolism.","No two languages are ever sufficiently similar to be considered as representing the same social reality.","Cultural anthropology is more and more rapidly getting to realize itself as a strictly historical science.","The psychology of a language which, in one way or another, is imposed upon one because of factors beyond one's control, is very different from the psychology of a language which one accepts of one's free will.","We see and hear and otherwise experience very largely as we do because the language habits of our community predispose certain choices of interpretation.","In a sense, every form of expression is imposed upon one by social factors, one's own language above all.","Human beings do not live in the objective world alone, nor alone in the world of social activity as ordinarily understood, but are very much at the mercy of the particular language which has become the medium of expression for their society.","It is no secret that the fruits of language study are in no sort of relation to the labour spent on teaching and learning them.","A standard international language should not only be simple, regular, and logical, but also rich and creative.","English, once accepted as an international language, is no more secure than French has proved to be as the one and only accepted language of diplomacy or as Latin has proved to be as the international language of science.","Impatience translates itself into a desire to have something immediate done about it all, and, as is generally the case with impatience, resolves itself in the easiest way that lies ready to hand.","French and German illustrate the misleading character of apparent grammatical simplicity just as well.","As a matter of fact, a national language which spreads beyond its own confines very quickly loses much of its original richness of content and is in no better case than a constructed language.","It is quite an illusion to imagine that one adjusts to reality essentially without the use of language and that language is merely an incidental means of solving specific problems of communication or reflection.","It would, of course, be hopeless to attempt to crowd into an international language all those local overtones of meaning which are so dear to the heart of the nationalist.","National languages are all huge systems of vested interests which sullenly resist critical inquiry.","The spirit of logical analysis should in practice blend with the practical pressure for the adoption of some form of international language, but it should not allow itself to be stampeded by it.","A common allegiance to form of expression that is identified with no single national unit is likely to prove one of the most potent symbols of the freedom of the human spirit that the world has yet known.","A common creation demands a common sacrifice, and perhaps not the least potent argument in favour of a constructed international language is the fact that it is equally foreign, or apparently so, to the traditions of all nationalities.","A firm, for instance, that does business in many countries of the world is driven to spend an enormous amount of time, labour, and money in providing for translation services.","A logical analysis of reflexive usages in French shows, however, that this simplicity is an illusion and that, so far from helping the foreigner, it is more calculated to bother him.","A second type of direct evidence is formed by statements, whether as formal legends or personal information, regarding the age or relative sequence of events in tribal history made by the natives themselves.","Both French and Latin are involved with nationalistic and religious implications which could not be entirely shaken off, and so, while they seemed for a long time to have solved the international language problem up to a certain point, they did not really do so in spirit.","Comparison of statements made at different periods frequently enable us to give maximal and minimal dates to the appearance of a cultural element or to assign the time limits to a movement of population.","I am convinced that the stratigraphic method will in the future enable archaeology to throw far more light on the history of American culture than it has done in the past.","More and more, unsolicited gifts from without are likely to be received with unconscious resentment.","One of the glories of English simplicity is the possibility of using the same word as noun and verb.","So far as the advocates of a constructed international language are concerned, it is rather to be wondered at how much in common their proposals actually have, both in vocabulary and in general spirit of procedure.","The attitude of independence toward a constructed language which all national speakers must adopt is really a great advantage, because it tends to make man see himself as the master of language instead of its obedient servant.","The modern mind tends to be more and more critical and analytical in spirit, hence it must devise for itself an engine of expression which is logically defensible at every point and which tends to correspond to the rigorous spirit of modern science.","The supposed inferiority of a constructed language to a national one on the score of richness of connotation is, of course, no criticism of the idea of a constructed language.","These examples of the lack of simplicity in English and French, all appearances to the contrary, could be multiplied almost without limit and apply to all national languages."],"Edward Snowden":["Every person remembers some moment in their life where they witnessed some injustice, big or small, and looked away because the consequences of intervening seemed too

But there's a limit to the amount of incivility and inequality and inhumanity that each individual can tolerate. I crossed that line. And I'm no longer alone.","I can't in good conscience allow the U.S. government to destroy privacy, internet freedom and basic liberties for people around the world with this massive surveillance machine they're secretly building.","No system of mass surveillance has existed in any society that we know of to this point that has not been abused.","Even if you're not doing anything wrong, you are being watched and recorded.","You could watch entire villages and see what everyone was doing. I watched NSA tracking people's Internet activities as they typed. I became aware of just how invasive U.S. surveillance capabilities had become. I realized the true breadth of this system. And almost nobody knew it was happening.","Being a patriot doesn't mean prioritizing service to government above all else. Being a patriot means knowing when to protect your country, knowing when to protect your Constitution, knowing when to protect your countrymen, from the violations of and encroachments of adversaries. And those adversaries don't have to be foreign countries.","I wanted to fight in the Iraq war because I felt like I had an obligation as a human being to help free people from oppression.","I have been a systems engineer, systems administrator, a senior adviser for the Central Intelligence Agency, a solutions consultant and a telecommunications information systems officer.","The NSA has built an infrastructure that allows it to intercept almost everything. With this capability, the vast majority of human communications are automatically ingested without targeting. If I wanted to see your emails or your wife's phone, all I have to do is use intercepts. I can get your emails, passwords, phone records, credit cards.","There can be no faith in government if our highest offices are excused from scrutiny - they should be setting the example of transparency.","I have no intention of hiding who I am because I know I have done nothing wrong.","I do not want to live in a world where everything I do and say is recorded. That is not something I am willing to support or live under.","When people say, 'Why don't you face the music?'

Phone number, email, user id, cell phone handset id (IMEI), and so on - it's all the same.","The NSA has the greatest surveillance capabilities in American history... The real problem is that they're using these capabilities to make us vulnerable.","I carefully evaluated every single document I disclosed to ensure that each was legitimately in the public interest. There are all sorts of documents that would have made a big impact that I didn't turn over, because harming people isn't my goal. Transparency is.","Sometimes to do the right thing, you have to break a law. And the key there is in terms of civil disobedience. You have to make sure that what you're risking, what you're bringing onto yourself, does not serve as a detriment to anyone else. It doesn't hurt anybody else.","The only time you can be completely free from risk is when you're in prison.","What we've seen over the last decade is we've seen a departure from the traditional work of the National Security Agency. They've become sort of the national hacking agency, the national surveillance agency. And they've lost sight of the fact that everything they do is supposed to make us more secure as a nation and a society.","It may be that by watching everywhere we go, by watching everything we do, by analyzing every word we say, by waiting and passing judgment over every association we make and every person we love, that we could uncover a terrorist plot, or we could discover more criminals. But is that the kind of society we want to live in?","If I had to describe myself, I wouldn't use words like 'hero.' I wouldn't use 'patriot,' and I wouldn't use 'traitor.' I'd say I'm an American and I'm a citizen, just like everyone else.","I would rather be without a state than without a voice.","I do agree that when it comes to cyber warfare, we have more to lose than any other nation on earth.","I do not expect to see home again, though that is what I want.","You can't come forward against the world's most powerful intelligence agencies and be completely free from risk.","We're losing our way as a society. If we don't stand up, if we don't say what we think those rights should be, and if we don't protect them, we will very soon find out that we do not have them.","When you are in positions of privileged access... you see things that may be disturbing. Over time, that awareness of wrongdoing sort of builds up.","I've been a spy for almost all of my adult life - I don't like being in the spotlight.","You shouldn't change your behavior because a government agency somewhere is doing the wrong thing. If we sacrifice our values because we're afraid, we don't care very much about those values.","My sole motive is to inform the public as to that which is done in their name and that which is done against them.","The immoral cannot be made moral through the use of secret law.","What the government wants is something they never had before. They want total awareness. The question is, is that something we should be allowing?","For me, in terms of personal satisfaction, the mission's already accomplished. I already won. As soon as the journalists were able to work, everything that I had been trying to do was validated. Because, remember, I didn't want to change society. I wanted to give society a chance to determine if it should change itself.","That's the beauty of the Internet is that we're no longer tied to our communities by physical connections.","I care more about the country than what happens to me. But we can't allow the law to become a political weapon or agree to scare people away from standing up for their rights, no matter how good the deal. I'm not going to be part of that.","Bathtub falls and police officers kill more Americans than terrorism, yet we've been asked to sacrifice our most sacred rights for fear of falling victim to it.","All I can say right now is the U.S. government is not going to be able to cover this up by jailing or murdering me. Truth is coming, and it cannot be stopped.","I think the most important idea is to remember that there have been times throughout American history where what is right is not the same as what is legal.","I don't want to live in a society that does these sort of things... I do not want to live in a world where everything I do and say is recorded. That is not something I am willing to support or live under.","When you are subverting the power of government, that's a fundamentally dangerous thing to democracy.","All I wanted was for the public to be able to have a say in how they are governed. That is a milestone we left a long time ago.","I support a guaranteed basic income. I think we should take care of sick people. I believe women can make their own choices and that the government is at its best when it's building bridges instead of bombs.","I have no regrets.","Most of the secrets the CIA has are about people, not machines and systems, so I didn't feel comfortable with disclosures that I thought could endanger anyone.","Perhaps I am naive, but I believe that at this point in history, the greatest danger to our freedom and way of life comes from the reasonable fear of omniscient State powers kept in check by nothing more than policy documents.","Being called a traitor by Dick Cheney is the highest honor you can give an American, and the more panicked talk we hear from people like him... the better off we all are.","They still have negligent auditing, they still have things going for a walk, and they have no idea where they're coming from, and they have no idea where they're going. And if that's the case, how can we, as the public, trust the NSA with all of our information, with all of our private records, the permanent record of our lives?","We have seen enough criminality on the part of government. It is hypocritical to make this allegation against me. They have narrowed the public sphere of influence.","Ask yourself: if I were a Chinese spy, why wouldn't I have flown directly into Beijing? I could be living in a palace petting a phoenix by now.","After 9/11, many of the most important news outlets in America abdicated their role as a check to power - the journalistic responsibility to challenge the excesses of government - for fear of being seen as unpatriotic and punished in the market during a period of heightened nationalism.","The NSA and Israel wrote Stuxnet together.","Suspicionless surveillance does not become okay simply because it's only victimizing 95% of the world instead of 100%.","Citizens with a conscience are not going to ignore wrong-doing simply because they'll be destroyed for it: the conscience forbids it.","I am not trying to bring down the NSA, I am working to improve the NSA. I am still working for the NSA right now. They are the only ones who don't realize it.","It's been vindicating to see the reaction from lawmakers, judges, public bodies around the world, civil liberties activists who have said it's true that we have a right to at least know the broad outlines of what our government's doing in our name and what it's doing against us.","I think it's important to remember that people don't set their lives on fire. They don't walk away from their extraordinarily, extraordinarily comfortable lives ... for no reason.","Even though we may focus first on the rights of our own country, that does not mean that we should disregard the rights of everyone else.","It's important that we elevate and primarily focus on the rights of American citizens, but it's also important that we don't forget, 95 percent of the world's population lives beyond our own borders.","No one would argue that it's in the United States' interest to have independent knowledge of the plans and intentions of foreign countries. But we need to think about where to draw the line on these kind of operations so we're not always attacking our allies, the people we trust, the people we need to rely on, and to have them in turn rely on us.","I don't want to harm my government. I want to help my government. But the fact that they are willing to completely ignore due process, they're willing to declare guilt without ever seeing a trial, these are things that we need to work against as a society and say, 'Hey, this is not appropriate.'","I never chose to be in Russia, and I would prefer to be in my own country, but if I can't make it home, I will continue to work very much in the same way that I have... What happens to me is not as important; I simply serve as the mechanism of disclosure.","I will be satisfied if the federation of secret law, unequal pardon and irresistible executive powers that rule the world that I love are revealed even for an instant.","The NSA routinely lies in response to congressional inquiries about the scope of surveillance in America.","I have had many opportunities to flee HK, but I would rather stay and fight the United States government in the courts, because I have faith in Hong Kong's rule of law.","My intention is to ask the courts and people of Hong Kong to decide my fate.","I have had no contact with the Chinese government. I only work with journalists.","Congress hasn't declared war on the countries - the majority of them are our allies - but without asking for public permission, NSA is running network operations against them that affect millions of innocent people. And for what? So we can have secret access to a computer in a country we're not even fighting?","If I target for example an email address, for example under FAA 702, and that email address sent something to you, Joe America, the analyst gets it. All of it. IPs, raw data, content, headers, attachments, everything. And it gets saved for a very long time - and can be extended further with waivers rather than warrants.","A lot of people in 2008 voted for Obama. I did not vote for him. I voted for a third party. But I believed in Obama's promises.","The United States Government has placed me on no-fly lists.","If they had taught a class on how to be the kind of citizen Dick Cheney worries about, I would have finished high school.","I'm an engineer, not a politician.","What does that mean for a society, for a democracy, when the people that you elect on the basis of promises can basically suborn the will of the electorate?","Who I am really doesn't matter at all. If I'm the worst person in the world, you can hate me and move on. What really matters here are the issues. What really matters here is the kind of government we want, the kind of Internet we want, the kind of relationship between people and societies.","The public interest is not always the same as the national interest. Going to war with people who are not our enemy in places that are not a threat doesn't make us safe, and that applies whether it's in Iraq or on the Internet. The Internet is not the enemy. Our economy is not the enemy.","When you use any kind of internet-based capability, any kind of electronic capability, to cause damage to a private entity or a foreign nation or a foreign actor, these are potential acts of war.","I have been made stateless and hounded for my act of political expression.","I did not seek to sell U.S. secrets. I did not partner with any foreign government to guarantee my safety. Instead, I took what I knew to the public so what affects all of us can be discussed by all of us in the light of day, and I asked the world for justice."],"Edward St Aubyn":["Proust is a hero of mine. I read 'A la recherche' in one go, and I'm a very slow reader. It had an astonishing impact, reading it on my own and being my main company.

And they're not necessarily friends. The writer is the one I want to reinforce; the author would just feed on the reviews - so I'm in favour of starving him.","The whole 'Melrose' series is an attempt to tell the truth, and is based on the idea that there is some salutary or liberating power in telling the truth.","I'm really not responsible for what mental operation people have when they're reading my books other than the ones which are created by literary effects.","The Booker 2011 is of no more interest to me than the world heavyweight championship, which I'm not going to win either.

But learning by having ideas is really one of the rare and isolated events in nature.","Human education is concerned with certain changes in the intellects, characters and behavior of men, its problems being roughly included under these four topics: Aims, materials, means and methods.","Human folk are as a matter of fact eager to find intelligence in animals.","It will, of course, be understood that directly or indirectly, soon or late, every advance in the sciences of human nature will contribute to our success in controlling human nature and changing it to the advantage of the common weal.","On the whole, the psychological work of the last quarter of the nineteenth century emphasized the study of consciousness to the neglect of the total life of intellect and character.","So the animal finally performs in that situation only the fitting act.","Some statements concern the conscious states of the animal, what he is to himself as an inner life; others concern his original and acquired ways of response, his behavior, what he is an outside observer.","The dog, on the other hand, has few or no ideas because his brain acts in coarse fashion and because there are few connections with each single process.","The function of intellect is to provide a means of modifying our reactions to the circumstances of life, so that we may secure pleasure, the symptom of welfare.","The intellectual evolution of the race consists in an increase in the number, delicacy, complexity, permanence and speed of formation of such associations.","The real difference between a man's scientific judgments about himself and the judgment of others about him is he has added sources of knowledge.","The restriction of studies of human intellect and character to studies of conscious states was not without influence on a scientific studies of animal psychology.","The un-conscious distortion of the facts is almost harmless compared to the unconscious neglect of an animal's mental life until it verges on the unusual and marvelous.","This growth in the number, speed of formation, permanence, delicacy and complexity of associations possible for an animal reaches its acme in the case of man.","To the intelligent man with an interest in human nature it must often appear strange that so much of the energy of the scientific world has been spent on the study of the body and so little on the study of the mind."],"Edward Tufte":["It is straightforward for me to be ethical, responsible, and kind-hearted because I have the resources to support that.","Beautiful Evidence is about the theory and practice of analytical design.","A practical part of my teaching is to provide demonstrative, hands-on experiences.","The point of the essay is to change things.","What this means is that we shouldn't abbreviate the truth but rather get a new method of presentation.","I do believe that there are some universal cognitive tasks that are deep and profound - indeed, so deep and profound that it is worthwhile to understand them in order to design our displays in accord with those tasks.","The goal is to provide analytical tools that will last students a lifetime.","There are many true statements about complex topics that are too long to fit on a PowerPoint slide.","The leading edge in evidence presentation is in science; the leading edge in beauty is in high art.","The speculative part of my work is that these particular cognitive tasks - ways of thinking analytically - are tied to nature's laws.","That is to say, nature's laws are causal;

Such rules and laws are deduced from the accomplished fact; they are the products of reflection.","Photography to the amateur is recreation, to the professional it is work, and hard work too, no matter how pleasurable it my be.","I see no reason for recording the obvious.","I was extravagant in the matter of cameras - anything photographic - I had to have the best. But that was to further my work. In most things I have gone along with the plainest - or without.","There is nothing like a Bach fugue to remove me from a discordant moment... only Bach hold up fresh and strong after repeated playing. I can always return to Bach when the other records weary me."],"Edward Whitacre, Jr.":["Be willing to step outside your comfort zone once in a while; take the risks in life that seem worth taking. The ride might not be as predictable if you'd just planted your feet and stayed put, but it will be a heck of a lot more interesting.","Find your passion is in life, and do what you can to integrate that into your work life. That's not to say you won't have occasional frustrations in your job - that just goes with the territory - but at least you'll feel better inside, and that, over time, will mean more to you than you might think.","When I went into GM there was a lack of morale. The company had gone bankrupt and the people who worked there were embarrassed. Underneath all of, though, there was a will to show what they were capable of, but nobody knew exactly what to do.","No partnership between two independent companies, no matter how well run, can match the speed, effectiveness, responsiveness and efficiency of a solely owned company.","This merger is a logical next step that creates substantial value for customers and stockholders of both AT&T and BellSouth. It will benefit customers through new services and expanded service capabilities.","If someone wants to transmit a high-quality service with no interruptions and 'guaranteed this, guaranteed that,' they should be willing to pay for that.","I'm a pretty average guy and want to keep a low profile. I don't want the world necessarily to know about me.","TARP is funded by taxpayers, so there are many rules about how that money can and can't be used. The result: GM spends an awful lot of time checking in with the people who administer TARP over everything from hiring to executive compensation and management. For a global company, that adds up to a lot of distraction.","At AT&T, I learned an awful lot about people, and how important it is to have the right people in the right jobs. And when I say 'right people,' I'm not talking about their college degree or work history; I'm talking about things like bearing - How does this person interact with other people? Can he or she talk to you and not tick you off?","I don't know anything about cars. A business is a business, and I think I can learn about cars. I'm not that old, and I think the business principles are the same.","I am honored to be able to serve GM at this critical juncture and take part in its reinvention.","AT&T will not block access to the public Internet or degrade service, period.","My goal in coming to General Motors was to help restore profitability, build a strong market position and position this iconic company for success. We are clearly on that path.","So long as TARP money is wrapped up in GM, the company will never shake its 'Government Motors' image. That label, as competitors and GM employees are keenly aware, is code for one thing: 'GM is a failure.'","I find people to be people everywhere. Everyone wants the same thing - be successful.","None of us has control over the economy, the job market, or anything else in the global sense. But we are 100% in charge of how we respond to challenges that come our way, be it the loss of a job, a career derailment, or some other disappointment.","I started at GM knowing very little about that particular business. Not being an expert means you have to learn everything, starting from the basics.","When I got to GM they were using a matrix method of management which means everybody has more than one boss. I first heard about that system many years ago. It's supposed to help with collaboration, but my assessment is that it's pretty hard to get geared for action that way.","I've been accused many times of not talking very much, but I guess I don't believe in talking things to death. You can talk too much on most anything and it stops being productive. There is a time for action. Eventually you have to pull the trigger."],"Edward Witten":["I don't care about movies. I tend to play badminton once a week.","We know a lot of things, but what we don't know is a lot more.","But the beauty of Einstein's equations, for example, is just as real to anyone who's experienced it as the beauty of music. We've learned in the 20th century that the equations that work have inner harmony.","You have that one basic string, but it can vibrate in many ways. But we're trying to get a lot of particles because experimental physicists have discovered a lot of particles.","Regardless of any deviations, it was clear I was supposed to end up in math and physics.","As of now, string theorists have no explanation of why there are three large dimensions as well as time, and the other dimensions are microscopic. Proposals about that have been all over the map.","Having those extra dimensions and therefore many ways the string can vibrate in many different directions turns out to be the key to being able to describe all the particles that we see.","I have a tendency, more than most other physicists, to try to figure out everything all at once, before I publish. And even to try to figure out everything in my head, without pencil and paper.","If you are a researcher, you are trying to figure out what the question is as well as what the answer is.","As far as extra dimensions are concerned, very tiny extra dimensions wouldn't be perceived in everyday life, just as atoms aren't: we see many atoms together but we don't see atoms individually.","As for the forces, electromagnetism and gravity we experience in everyday life. But the weak and strong forces are beyond our ordinary experience. So in physics, lots of the basic building blocks take 20th- or perhaps 21st-century equipment to explore.","Even before string theory, especially as physics developed in the 20th century, it turned out that the equations that really work in describing nature with the most generality and the greatest simplicity are very elegant and subtle.","I wouldn't have thought that a wrong theory should lead us to understand better the ordinary quantum field theories or to have new insights about the quantum states of black holes.","If I take the theory as we have it now, literally, I would conclude that extra dimensions really exist. They're part of nature. We don't really know how big they are yet, but we hope to explore that in various ways.","One of the basic things about a string is that it can vibrate in many different shapes or forms, which gives music its beauty.","So when you ask me how string theory might be tested, I can tell you what's likely to happen at accelerators or some parts of the theory that are likely to be tested.","Spreading out the particle into a string is a step in the direction of making everything we're familiar with fuzzy. You enter a completely new world where things aren't at all what you're used to.","String theory is an attempt at a deeper description of nature by thinking of an elementary particle not as a little point but as a little loop of vibrating string.","Technically you need the extra dimensions. At first people didn't like them too much, but they've got a big benefit, which is that the ability of string theory to describe all the elementary particles and their forces along with gravity depends on using the extra dimensions.","The theory has to be interpreted that extra dimensions beyond the ordinary four dimensions the three spatial dimensions plus time are sufficiently small that they haven't been observed yet.","There was a long history of speculation that in quantum gravity, unlike Einstein's classical theory, it might be possible for the topology of spacetime to change.","In Einstein's general relativity the structure of space can change but not its topology. Topology is the property of something that doesn't change when you bend it or stretch it as long as you don't break anything.","It's indeed surprising that replacing the elementary particle with a string leads to such a big change in things. I'm tempted to say that it has to do with the fuzziness it introduces.","On the other hand, we don't understand the theory too completely, and because of this fuzziness of spacetime, the very concept of spacetime and spacetime dimensions isn't precisely defined.","Quantum mechanics brought an unexpected fuzziness into physics because of quantum uncertainty, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.","It's an exaggeration to say that I came up with M-theory.","Quantum mechanics brought an unexpected fuzziness into physics because of quantum uncertainty, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. String theory does so again because a point particle is replaced by a string, which is more spread out.","One very important aspect of string theory is definitely testable. That was the prediction of supersymmetry, which emerged from string theory in the early '70s.","I'm actually, for the most part, a complete agnostic politically.","I just think too many nice things have happened in string theory for it to be all wrong. Humans do not understand it very well, but I just don't believe there is a big cosmic conspiracy that created this incredible thing that has nothing to do with the real world."],"Edward Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax":["True merit, like a river, the deeper it is, the less noise it makes.","The plainer the dress, the greater luster does beauty appear.","Those who are of the opinion that money will do everything may reasonably be expected to do everything for money.","Ignorance makes most men go into a political party, and shame keeps them from getting out of it.","Gratitude is one of those things that cannot be bought.

Making matters worse, the resulting riches from these resources rarely benefit the people of the country from which they come.","There's only a certain number of movies I'm going to get made, and it's important to me that they each be original somehow.","There is no reason why challenging themes and engaging stories have to be mutually exclusive - in fact, each can fuel the other. As a filmmaker, I want to entertain people first and foremost. If out of that comes a greater awareness and understanding of a time or a circumstance, then the hope is that change can happen.","There is something universal in the theme of a man trying to save his family in the midst of the most terrible circumstances. It is not limited to Sierra Leone. This story could apply to any number of places where ordinary people have been caught up in political events beyond their control.","The funny thing is, when you look at photos of Tuvia Bielski, he was fair, blue-eyed, and could pass for a Gentile.","Scale is not just something that a director wants so as to play with all the toys. Scale also lends verisimilitude, to put together a real world.","I think it's easier to be cynical. I think the temptation, often, among writers is to write about anything other than real, true, deep feelings.","I think it's too easy often to find a villain out of the headlines and to then repeat that villainy again and again and again. You know, traditionally, America has always looked to scapegoat someone as the boogie man... there is a tradition in the most simplistic of action movies for there to be some horrible villain.","I think every culture - you can call it an American Ronin, a medieval knight errant, you could talk about 'Shane.' There is an archetype that I think is actually common to a lot of cultures, and even the Clint Eastwood stuff was probably as influenced by the Japanese stuff, and yet done by an Italian.","I don't think movies can ever be too intense, but people have to understand why you're showing them the things you are showing them.","I have nothing against diamonds, or rubies or emeralds or sapphires. I do object when their acquisition is complicit in the debasement of children or the destruction of a country.","I look at modern life and I see people not taking responsibility for their lives. The temptation to blame, to find external causes to one's own issues is something that is particularly modern. I know that personally I find that sense of responsibility interesting.","I think it's too easy often to find a villain out of the headlines and to then repeat that villainy again and again and again. You know, traditionally, America has always looked to scapegoat someone as the boogie man.","Samurai culture did exist really, for hundreds of years and the notion of people trying to create some sort of a moral code, the idea that there existed certain behaviors that could be celebrated and that could be operative in a life.","Sometimes when we weep in the movies we weep for ourselves or for a life unlived. Or we even go to the movies because we want to resist the emotion that's there in front of us. I think there is always a catharsis that I look for and that makes the movie experience worthwhile.","There is a segment of the American population that has been excluded from the national myth, and that should be redressed.","To me this movie is about what is valuable. To one person it might be a stone; to someone else, a story in a magazine; to another, it is a child. The juxtaposition of one man obsessed with finding a valuable diamond with another man risking his life to find his son is the beating heart of this film.","I, for one, suffer from a little bit of superhero fatigue.","I met a lot of women in the military with Meg Ryan, and they were remarkably impressive: Competent and strong and not versions of men, but versions of women. And they had stories to tell about how difficult it had been for them.","The issue of assault in the military is something that they've gone to great lengths to try to deal with - and have not entirely dealt with yet.","The military has been actually remarkable at dealing with race, but gender is an issue.","When I first thought about the military - and this goes all the way back to 'Glory' - I learned really quickly that it isn't a monolith. It is really an institution made up of some people with very different personalities and people of different backgrounds.","In the necessary memorialisation of the six million dead, there had been precious little attention paid to those who survived and how they survived.","One reason why in Hollywood we are so often inventing heroes is that real heroes are vexing.","In my experience of the men of action I have met - whether from the Second World War or Iraq or Vietnam - they often had to do things that they would rather not reflect upon afterwards. This is perhaps one reason why the story of the Bielskis remained untold for so long.","I like to do everything I can to avoid rehearsals, even while we're rehearsing.","Every day and every scene, it's never the scene that you expect.","Sometimes when an actor and director work together for the first time, it's not as if there's a suspicion, but there is tentativeness, a certain amount of a right of passage you have to go through in order to get there. When it's already there from the beginning, it's such a plus.","If you don't know each other you spend time doing research together, having dinner, and talking about your lives. You try to find common ground. Once you're shooting, the pressures are so intense; you really want to have a channel of communication open to you already.","Like everyone, I was a kid who played chess when I was young. And I am admittedly old enough to have been around during the fervor of the match in Reykjavik and the rise of Bobby Fischer, so those two things conspired to pique my interest.","I watched aspirationally. I looked at movies that maybe I didn't entirely understand but which developed in me some thirst for their subjects or for their context, and that became part of how I came to understand the world.","The idea that things can be serious minded but must be somehow balkanized in the art-house ghetto is very upsetting because I think it limits not just the audience who was already going to see it, but those who might have had their tastes developed at a younger age.","I do watch 'It's a Wonderful Life' with my children at Christmas, and I liked it long before it went into the public domain and became a cliche.","When 'The Godfather' comes on, any time of the day or night, I'm lost because I'm incapable of turning it off.","I've always believed that the stories and the performances are more important than I am. I think that the more invisible that my hand is, the more attention people can pay to the story and to those performances.","I tend not to go look at movies before I make a movie. I'd rather not be specifically influenced.","I think that I am interested in the resonance between character drama and high stakes, either situational or political or social or other kind of elevated drama, and I tend to find that those things combust.","I'm always interested in the ways in which a character can inhabit either a theme or a premise personally, so that those scenes that are about his character or his relationship with other characters feel in context and don't seem to be apart from or oddly vestigial to the actual drama.","When we did 'Thirtysomething,' television was either about doctors, lawyers, or cops.","My very first job was working on a TV show that was a prestigious TV show and well done - was called 'Family.'","People, especially press, want to pigeonhole you.","If a director is really a director, I think he's interested in more than one thing.","I might have painted myself into a bit of a corner doing all these big, serious David Lean-esque movies.","I know that when I'm writing, I always want to be directing.","If you take away scale, the nature of the story changes. I made a joke the other day: if I were to try to make 'Glory' now, rather than be about a regiment, it would be about a platoon. It would be seven men in the woods rather than all the men on the beach.","I was trained in the repertory theater. You would do Moliere one night and Sam Shepard the next.","I've always been drawn to all sorts of genres and all sorts of voices.","I guess television is so much on the word. It's so much closer to playwriting - the scale is more just about the voices and the internal lives. Movies, it's a very different canvas.","I've never been one of those guys who storyboards every frame, because that would take away some of the mystery and some of the fun.","My job is to tell the truth about what's happening as best I can.","The issue of diamonds in Africa is inseparable from the issue of child soldiers.","When my own son was 12, we didn't want toy guns in the house. So he just picked up a stick and went, 'Bam! Bam! Bam!' That's the testosterone of a 12-year-old boy.","There's a rising tide of concern among activists, economists, and artists about Africa. Theres a temptation to think of it as a monolith as opposed to all these different countries with different problems.","I would say that 'Schindler's List,' as powerful as it was, seemed to have continued with a particular iconography of victimization and passivity. That was the iconography with which I had grown up and to which I had grown accustomed.","'Milk' doesn't imply that all gay men who stayed in the closet were cowards.","Yes, illness is serious, but the indignities are also funny. And that defines my world view.","There is nothing that is so serious that you can't also see its comic side. Comedy is a way of talking about the most serious things.","It's a harder time to make original, less conventional movies. But God, we need them!","Doctors are kind of this shibboleth in our society. We know what they do, and we depend on them, but we don't know a lot about what it feels like from their side.","As we began to read more and more journals of men who had been in the Civil War and then been in the Indian Wars, we realized there was a whole universe of men whose souls had been shattered, whose lives had been utterly destroyed by what they had to do.","I think most Americans probably believe that our relationship with Japan began in 1941. In fact, obviously, it began in 1854 when Commodore Perry sailed into Yokohama harbor and threatened to burn it down unless they would open up to trade with us. The imperial impulse was first ours historically.","In my office, we were talking about the fact that they'd announced a remake of 'A Star is Born,' and I was bemoaning the idea of a fourth remake. And the young guys who work in my office were giving me blank looks, like, 'What's 'A Star is Born?'","I've done all sorts of different kinds of action. We did a thing in 'Blood Diamond,' the attack on Freetown, where I carefully staged the action but did not show the camera operators what we were going to film - so it has the feel of documentary, trying to capture something, and that gave it a whole different feel.","You can spend an extraordinary amount of time raising independent money to do a movie for very little means. I've done it with 'Pawn Sacrifice.'","Ironically, it's easier to raise the money to make the film than it is to have the film find wide distribution.","I think to see American troops in an American city is, you know, the sum of all of our fears.","There have been bombings by extremists. They are not representatives of Islam. They're not representative of the vast majority of people who love this country, but nonetheless, they exist.","The ronin were those masterless men who roamed around, and yet they found themselves getting involved in circumstances they hadn't expected.","I'm very promiscuous in my tastes.","When you're in a fight, and you get hit, it hurts. And as you get older, you begin to take on the aches and the bruises of doing that.","You have to make choices always. It's about the omission of something for the sake of another.","The Beatles in 1963 came to America and became international celebrities, but Bobby Fischer was one of the first, as Elvis was, more in terms of the message created around him.","I had known a couple of people in college who went off the rails, who had significant bouts with mental illness.","The privilege I've had over 15 movies over a very long time has been to make movies that were ambitious or grown-up, complex, that had themes in them that were sometimes political, sometimes challenging, to make these movies on a scale.","If I try to think objectively about myself and my work, I would say I want to be intuitive and distinctive.","I like to reveal people with some of the niceties of social behavior stripped away and the moral, ethical, and political issues are revealed.","The phone that you carry around with you. It's not just that it's a locator for anybody who wants to actually find out where you are, but it's also a leash. It's a reminder just how tethered you are.","I think there is a very powerful wish that we all have of being self-contained and having sort of opted out or choosing to remove ourselves from society and to have no ties and no obligations, and even no possessions. To be free in a particular way.","The Mitch Rapp novels are as thrilling and entertaining as they are relevant. I am delighted to be given the opportunity to translate them to the screen.","Often, romantic comedies exist in a vacuum, and it's kind of odd.","We've suspended the willing suspension of disbelief. We have given up that relationship, that almost hypnotic engagement, with the characters up on the screen.","There's a great tradition of actors taking on parts of much less obvious sympathy.","People tend not to dwell on drama.","In my experience, the men of World War II, the vets of Vietnam, even guys coming back from Iraq, are loath to talk about their experiences. And the survivors of the Holocaust, particularly, are often very close-mouthed about their stories, even to their own children.","The promise of an action movie to a certain audience is not a bad thing.","One resists categorization at one's peril.","The thing that has always interested me - amidst the scale, the historical spectacle, or the social significance or the political resonance - has been the relationships.","A sex scene is gratuitous when it only exists for its own sake.","I really look forward to that opportunity to be a student and discover things. That keeps it interesting for me. And I sometimes get easily bored, and there are still some things I wanna talk about instead of repeating something.","People make the assumption that you're only interested in one thing based on the most recent thing you've done. But some directors can be pretty promiscuous about their tastes, and that's how I want to challenge myself.","I've enjoyed the singular focus of not going back and forth between the two mediums. It isn't about the screen size so much as film being where the stories I'm most interested in telling happen to be at.","One of the great tragedies is that there is so much less open land available in Japan today. Many Japanese come to New Zealand because of its beauty.","It's one thing to plan and imagine what you want on a film, but when you actually arrive and survey the scene, there's a moment of, 'Oh my God, what was I thinking?'","Anorexia is pernicious and not something which goes away overnight.","It's hard not to want to become Ken Burns at times. I'm interested in being a Ken Burns who reaches that 17-year-old who goes to the multiplex just to see a good story well-told. And if there's history in it, all the better.","Movies, as I grew up loving them, were always about something.","Growing up, movies were something my family and, later, my friends and I would stay up all night talking about. The movies I remember moved me and forced you to think about things that made you know yourself better."],"Edward de Bono":["Creativity involves breaking out of established patterns in order to look at things in a different way.","Creativity is a great motivator because it makes people interested in what they are doing. Creativity gives hope that there can be a worthwhile idea. Creativity gives the possibility of some sort of achievement to everyone. Creativity makes life more fun and more interesting.","Studies have shown that 90% of error in thinking is due to error in perception. If you can change your perception, you can change your emotion and this can lead to new ideas.","Many highly intelligent people are poor thinkers. Many people of average intelligence are skilled thinkers. The power of a car is separate from the way the car is driven.","Creative thinking - in terms of idea creativity - is not a mystical talent. It is a skill that can be practised and nurtured.","Logic will never change emotion or perception.","The need to be right all the time is the biggest bar to new ideas.","One very important aspect of motivation is the willingness to stop and to look at things that no one else has bothered to look at. This simple process of focusing on things that are normally taken for granted is a powerful source of creativity.","An expert is someone who has succeeded in making decisions and judgements simpler through knowing what to pay attention to and what to ignore.","In the future, instead of striving to be right at a high cost, it will be more appropriate to be flexible and plural at a lower cost. If you cannot accurately predict the future then you must flexibly be prepared to deal with various possible futures.","Humor is by far the most significant activity of the human brain.","People should realize we're jerks just like them.","A memory is what is left when something happens and does not completely unhappen.","Dealing with complexity is an inefficient and unnecessary waste of time, attention and mental energy. There is never any justification for things being complex when they could be simple.","An idea that is developed and put into action is more important than an idea that exists only as an idea.","Most executives, many scientists, and almost all business school graduates believe that if you analyze data, this will give you new ideas. Unfortunately, this belief is totally wrong. The mind can only see what it is prepared to see.","There's a danger in the internet and social media. The notion that information is enough, that more and more information is enough, that you don't have to think, you just have to get more information - gets very dangerous.","If you never change your mind, why have one?","We need creativity in order to break free from the temporary structures that have been set up by a particular sequence of experience.","I think there is a danger with young people of being dependent in the sense that they don't acquire any identity or self-image of themselves as thinkers.","Unhappiness is best defined as the difference between our talents and our expectations.","If you wait for opportunities to occur, you will be one of the crowd.","Removing the faults in a stage-coach may produce a perfect stage-coach, but it is unlikely to produce the first motor car.","A painter may be looking at the world in a way which is very different from everyone else. If he's a craftsman, he can get other people to see the world through his eyes, and so he enlarges our vision, perception, and there's great value in that.","Teaching thinking for just five hours to unemployed youngsters increased employment 500 percent.","Opportunity ideas do not lie around waiting to be discovered. Such ideas need to be produced.","It has always surprised me how little attention philosophers have paid to humor, since it is a more significant process of mind than reason. Reason can only sort out perceptions, but the humor process is involved in changing them.","Sometimes the situation is only a problem because it is looked at in a certain way. Looked at in another way, the right course of action may be so obvious that the problem no longer exists.","Argument is meant to reveal the truth, not to create it.","Humor is probably the most significant characteristics of the human mind. Far more significant than reason. In fact, reason is actually a very cheap commodity.","In a sense, words are encyclopedias of ignorance because they freeze perceptions at one moment in history and then insist we continue to use these frozen perceptions when we should be doing better.","Most of the mistakes in thinking are inadequacies of perception rather than mistakes of logic.","The purpose of science is not to analyze or describe but to make useful models of the world. A model is useful if it allows us to get use out of it.","I must say, I don't feel very qualified to be a pop star. I feel very awkward at times in the role.","To be successful you have to be lucky, or a little mad, or very talented, or find yourself in a rapid growth field.","What the joke displays is a switch in perception. This is important in changing the way we think.","My thinking was taught to tribes in South Africa like the Zulus and Xhosas. At the time there were about 210 fights breaking out among them every month, but after they listened to my lessons, this fell to just four.","I think school is a place where thinking should be taught.","It's always amazed me how little attention philosophers, psychologists, or anyone else actually has paid to humor.","I do a great deal of work with young children, and if you give a child a problem, he may come up with a highly original solution, because he doesn't have the established route to it."],"Edwidge Danticat":["You have all these people in the city and everything has become centralized. If you live outside the city and you need a birth certificate or some official paper from the government, you have to travel to the city.","People think that there is a country there that these people are only around when they are on CNN. I don't think that's limited to Haiti.","To start with, for example this year, 2004, is the bicentennial of Haitian independence.","There is a frustration too, that at moments when there's not a coup, when there are not people in the streets, that the country disappears from people's consciousness.","That's whatever news topic, whatever political process any country is going through - whenever they are in the news, that's when they exist. If you don't see them they don't exist.","Someone has said that nations have interests, they don't have friends, and you see that over and over in U.S. policy.","People who want alternative information have to try so hard to find it.","People aren't really aware of what's happening in other places.","Or even the state of Florida, where they are prepared to execute children. Umm, well, you hope that at least that there is something there to be claimed.","On some levels, you can also have this feeling that we are being duped, somehow. And that the world is at play for something you would understand more if it were pure ideology. It is a very strange time and also basic things are being taken away.","On some level, now, we are joining the larger world and realizing that we are connected with people in these very scary ways, sometimes. What happened recently in Spain affects us here and brings questions up. It is too bad that people have to be shaken up in that way.","Napoleon had been fighting this army of slaves and free people in Haiti and it depleted his forces. And after the Revolution, when the French were driven out, they stopped and sold this big chunk of North America to the Americans for very little money.","More and more people are able to access information - thank goodness we have the Internet and if you are interested you can find things. Which is different than even 20 years ago.","In terms of the idea of long-term occupation - I have been reading a little bit more about this period - and you can see in that occupation are many lessons for the current occupation of Iraq. So we have these connections that go way back that people aren't aware of.","In Haiti you had the Duvaliers for 29 years and they were very well supported by the United States.","In fact that is the struggle that most Americans - As rich as this country is, most Americans are very limited in their interaction with the world, unless the world comes to us in a very shocking way.","I wanted to raise the voice of a lot of the people that I knew growing up, and this was, for the most part, poor people who had extraordinary dreams but also very amazing obstacles.","I think Haiti is a place that suffers so much from neglect that people only want to hear about it when It's at its extreme. And that's what they end up knowing about it.","I think daily that the country's future is being thrown to the wind.","Especially moments when things are very difficult and complicated for me and I am still trying to grasp what is happening and I am still trying to understand and to reach family back home.","Creating these messes that go from administration to administration and then you swoop in and clean them up - with that heroic Delta force - people not realizing that they were always there but doing different things than what we see them doing at the moment.","And the fact that Haiti was occupied for 19 years by the United States, from 1915 to 1934.","Also, people are not often aware of the way the United States' policies influence what happens in places like Haiti or El Salvador or Nicaragua.

It's incorrect, and it's a real problem.","I use a progressive alarm that makes a soft sound at first and then progressively gets louder. But I usually wake on the first sound, so it doesn't disturb my wife. When I used a loud alarm clock, I was more likely to hit it on the head and go back to sleep.","I have received a great deal of benefit from the simple yet difficult practice of learning to stop the internal voice in my head. I learned that the voice isn't me, and I don't need to keep rethinking events of the past nor overthink plans for the future. This skill has helped me both to focus and to pause before responding to unexpected events.","I exercise in the gym about three times a week. I vary the workout every time, but I'll always do some type of circuit work with weights.

The voices of the toys in the 'Toy Story' films, for example, are never audible to humans.","While problems in a film are fairly easy to identify, the sources of those problems are often extraordinarily difficult to assess. A mystifying plot twist or a less-than-credible change of heart in our main character is often caused by subtle underlying issues elsewhere in the story.","Creativity has to start somewhere, and we are true believers in the power of bracing, candid feedback, and the iterative process - reworking, reworking, and reworking again until a flawed story finds its through line or a hollow character finds its soul.","Beware of being blinded by your own success.","One of the effects Pixar University has on the culture is that it makes people less self-conscious about their work and gets them comfortable with being publicly reviewed.","I've certainly seen R&D groups, typically funded by large corporations, where they bring together a lot of smart people and nothing happens. And the reason nothing happens is that they don't have a clear goal.","If you want people to be let loose, you can't over-control them.","Throughout Pixar's history, we've had major meltdowns and crises. It's happened throughout our history: you reach a certain point, it doesn't work, and you start all over again.","When you take a director off a project, that makes a person feel humiliated because everyone knows it. But we're responsible because we put them in that position.","What I've learned running Pixar applies to all businesses.","For me, the work we did to turn around 'Toy Story 2' was the defining moment in Pixar's history.","We've always had ups and downs at Pixar, starting with the high we felt doing something we'd never done - 'Toy Story' - and the low we felt right after when we realized we'd messed a bunch of things up along the way.","People say they want to be in risky environments and do all kinds of exciting stuff. But they don't actually know what risk means: that risk actually does bring failure and mistakes.","Part of being the successful Pixar is that we will take risks on teams and ideas, and some of them won't work out. We only lose from this if we don't respond to the failures. If we respond, and we think it through and figure out how to move ahead, then we're learning from it. That's what Pixar is.","Every new idea in any field needs protection.","'Balance' is a soft word. It implies calm, something almost yogic, but that's not it at all. The process is always chaotic and turbulent.","With certain ideas, you can predict commercial success. So with a 'Toy Story 3' or a 'Cars 2,' you know the idea is more likely to have financial success. But if you go down that path too far, you become creatively bankrupt because you're just trying to repeat yourself."],"Edwin Edwards":["I could not lose unless I was caught in bed with a dead girl or a live boy.","The only way I can lose is if I'm caught in bed with either a dead girl or a live boy.","I never speak ill of dead people or live judges.","People say I've had brushes with the law.

It reminds us that the certainty and consistency of legal application is essential.","Democracy demands that judges confine themselves to a narrow sphere of influence - that is why the late Alexander Bickel called the judiciary the 'Least Dangerous Branch.' In a world governed by a proper conception of their role, judges don't play at being legislators - they leave that job to our elected representatives.","An expert is somebody who is more than 50 miles from home, has no responsibility for implementing the advice he gives, and shows slides.","As Alexander Hamilton said in 'The Federalist Papers,' law is about the exercise of judgment and not will.

Twenty states have passed their own versions of this law, and 11 additional ones have religious-liberty protections that state courts have interpreted to provide a similar level of protection.","The United States is in a time of transition. Courts have redefined marriage, and beliefs about human sexuality are changing. Will the right to dissent be protected? Will the right of Americans to speak and act in accord with what the United States had always believed about marriage - that it's a union of husband and wife - be tolerated?","Religious-liberty protections are one way of achieving civil peace even amid disagreement. The United States is a pluralistic society. To protect that pluralism and the rights of all Americans, of whatever faith they may practice, religious-liberty laws are good policy. Liberals committed to tolerance should embrace them.","In most countries, you have a monarch or some other principal person to whom its officers and its military swear their allegiance. Our officials in this country and our military swear allegiance to the Constitution. We say that when we say the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag.","In 'The Heritage Guide to the Constitution,' you find a most remarkable collection of scholarly work.

By contrast, Obamacare has added thousands of pages of bureaucratic regulations and will cost the federal government untold billions.","America was founded to be a beacon of liberty, particularly religious liberty. The framers of our Constitution sought to preserve religious liberty to such an extent that they made it the first right protected in the Bill of Rights.","President Reagan, expanding on President Lincoln's phrase, referred to America as 'the last, best hope of man on Earth.' But this last, best hope is beginning to fade.","To restore the American experiment in democratic self-government, religious believers need to redouble their civic efforts. For without our active participation in politics, the government will continue to trample on our rights. The Constitution does not prevent people of faith from being active in politics.","Pastors can lead the way in motivating the faithful to wise stewardship of their citizenship responsibilities. Without a healthy culture and civil society, limited government and ordered liberty will be impossible.","Since the '86 amnesty, the number of illegal immigrants has quadrupled. That should teach Congress a very important lesson: Amnesty 'bends' the rule of law. And bending the rule of law to reach a 'comprehensive' deal winds up provoking wholesale breaking of the law.","The 1986 act didn't turn illegal immigrants into citizens on the spot. It granted temporary resident status only to those who could prove they had resided continuously in America for five years.

We all know each other.","I'm such a failed politician that all of my rivals have disappeared, on both sides.","I'm no wealthier than Bibi Netanyahu or Arik Sharon.

The relevant question is at what stage can we no longer stop Iran from getting the bomb.","The red line must be drawn on Iran's nuclear enrichment program because these enrichment facilities are the only nuclear installations that we can definitely see and credibly target.","Yes, the world is short of perfect.","I'm in the government to make sure that if there's an opportunity to make peace, it won't be missed.","You can easily justify to anyone about the need to keep supporting Israel. We get very generous support. We need it.","Israel is much more effective when the Israelis are convinced that we are on the moral high ground: that we are acting not just out of might, but also out of right.","In Israel, there is a peace camp that can convene 200,000 people in central square of this city, on very short notice, and there is a major movement among academics, politicians, thinkers, and public leaders for peace, even at a painful price. On the Palestinian side, you can find them individually here and there, but there is no public movement.","The first intifada, I was then commander of Central Command, commanding the West Bank, basically. And I know to what extent the first intifada was a popular uprising.","I became a prime minister within four-and-a-half years, the shortest kind of career ever in Israeli political history.","Assad wanted Israel to capitulate in advance to all his demands. Only then would he agree to enter into substantive negotiations. I couldn't agree to this.","I am the Israeli leader who met most with Arafat.","Israel fits into the zeitgeist of our era. It is true that there are demographic threats to its existence. That is why a separation from the Palestinians is a compelling imperative.","I think first of all that Iran is a problem for the whole world.","I fought against Palestinians. I saw them.","I don't hate people. I just accept missions.","An independent, strong, thriving and peaceful State of Israel is the vengeance of the dead.","The Labor party under my leadership is working to bring the Israeli people together from all nationalities in the spirit of the scroll of independence.","I have acquired - some would say deservedly - quite a few rivals: former Israeli politicians, some of whom at their height were stars beloved by large parts of the public. But today, they aren't in politics, and when they sit alone in their room, they say to themselves that Barak is the one who showed them out the door.","I know that I am absolutely reliable. Absolutely.","I'm not a tycoon or anything like that. Does my property amount to several million dollars? Of course it does.","Israel cannot afford to be duped.","I think that Jordan is strong. I think that they will hold on. I believe that they've already opened their parliament and their system, the press and others, to many voices...

But when dealing with the entire Arab world, Israel can get a lot.","As long as in this territory west of the Jordan river there is only one political entity called Israel, it is going to be either non-Jewish or non-democratic. If this bloc of millions of Palestinians cannot vote, that will be an apartheid state.","The Middle East is a region where predictions go to die.","Hezbollah will support Assad to the end because his continuing hold on power is critical to its own survival.","The Syrian rebels, weakened by infighting, have also been victims of the growing rift between the U.S. and its closest Arab allies.","Israel will continue to act proactively to prevent the transfer of heavy missiles or advanced air defense systems from Syria to Hezbollah in southern Lebanon, which, of course, carries the risk of a military showdown.","I do not believe the efforts of the international community to stop Iran's nuclear program will bear fruit.","I'm not afraid of elections. I've won every election I've fought in.","Either we destroy world terror or world terror will destroy us.","Israel is the strongest nation in the Middle East, but we have to apply our strength wisely.","War is no picnic. Wars should be prevented, and if you can't prevent them, you have to put them off.","I will not discuss future hypothetical situations.","One of the lessons learned in the Middle East is to never try to anticipate the other side's moves.","I cannot penetrate the soul of Arafat. I cannot know in advance whether, behind all the masks, he's the kind of leader who can reach an agreement or whether he wants to be the Moses of the Palestinians, staying in front of the river and not crossing into the promised land.","To think that you can - as a Zionist, Jewish independent state at the end of the 20th century - rule over another people for generations without having any consequences - it's ridiculous.","There is no entity in the world that will dare attack Israel with chemical weapons.","I am confident the Obama administration will work professionally with any Israeli government.","Iran sees India, China, Pakistan and, allegedly, Israel around them with nuclear weapons.","I tend not to believe radical Muslim movements.","I know Fiat plans to start manufacturing cars in Iran. This is wrong.","With the globalization, it's difficult for governments to impose decisions on private companies.","As prime minister, I was the Israeli leader who walked the greatest distance in his offers to the Palestinians.","If you establish a right unity government, you create an effective platform to make... decisions because you have wider support of your own party.","Benjamin Netanyahu seems to avoid any initiative.","Prime Minister Menachem Begin ordered the destruction of an Iraqi nuclear reactor near Baghdad in 1981. This action delayed an Iraqi bomb by at least 15 years. The whole world condemned Israel - only to realize later how farsighted it had been.","When you launch a surgical operation, you must already be well deployed to follow it through with larger forces. That complicates matters: you need to be ready for a full-fledged campaign on the operational level and have the diplomatic backing lined up as well.","Saddam Hussein has set an example of defiance, especially against the first President Bush, that other Arab leaders cannot and should not emulate; the example leads only to empty gestures and developmental stagnation, both of which the Arab nations have had enough of already.","The aim of the Palestinian terror is not just to kill Israelis but also to break the will of Israeli society in order to dictate a political solution. Israel should never yield to this terror campaign.","If Israel does not find the way to disengage from the Palestinians, its future might resemble the experience of Belfast or Bosnia - two communities bleeding each other to death for generations.","Unfortunately, you cannot let your neck be kind of cut as a gesture for your neighbor, even if it's a good neighbor.","It's the role of a government to defend its soldiers and its citizens.","The Palestinian Authority cannot hold the stick at both ends: to incite violence, to participate in it, and to tell the world how - what kind of underdog they are."],"Ehud Olmert":["Promoting tolerance and human dignity is one of mankind's unfinished challenges.","Growing up in Israel, how can I not be an optimist? When you remember what Israel was 50 years ago and you see Israel now, one of the most successful countries in the world, stable, democratic, with an enormously stable economy despite everything that has happened in the global economy in the last few years, how can I not be an optimist?","Political leaders can help change the psychological climate which affects the quality of relationships among people.","I always wake up early Saturday morning, and I have a little bit more time, so I go to the gym.","Dictates are futile, and mutual accusations are nothing but useless word games.","There is no need to get caught up in any apocalyptic prophecies that have no basis in reality.","Many Palestinians have been living for decades in camps, disconnected from the environment in which they grew up, wallowing in poverty, in neglect, alienation, bitterness, and a deep, unrelenting sense of humiliation.","The values of democracy, brotherhood, and freedom that constitute the building blocks of American society are also shared by Israeli society, together with the faith in man's power and ability to change and influence his surroundings.","Stopping all the violent and hostile actions means ending the smuggling of arms into the Gaza territory.","When you fight for the impossible, sometimes you lose everything.","I want to separate from the Palestinians. I want them to have their independent, separate state on a contiguous territory, and I want Israel to exist, of course, as a Jewish state in its own territory, as an independent state in its own territory. The Palestinian state, the Israeli state, separate. This is my dream.","The State of Israel, in partnership with Project Better Place and Renault-Nissan, is set to become the first country in the world to initiate the mass deployment of electric vehicles.","Historic scores cannot be settled, and scars cannot be obliterated.","Every word I wrote in my book is documented, certified, true, and correct. The truth wins, and that is my picture.","How are fears born? They are born because of differences in tradition and history; they are born because of differences in emotional, political and national circumstances. Because of such differences, people fear they cannot live together.","The military operation in Lebanon was the most successful military operation in recent Israeli history. Many in Israel don't recognise that.","Every prime minister ... has the responsibility to provide security for his people.","When the President of Iran talks about removing Israel from the face of the Earth and is building nuclear bombs with a range of 3000km, you have to be worried.","It is important that democracy in Lebanon is protected and that Hezbollah will not be supported by outside forces like Syria and Iran.","In Israel we tend to be carried away by our emotions.","A prime minister must not promise things that can't be fulfilled.","A prime minister has to keep a certain balance when dealing with sensitive issues.","There is a Western world. There is America. There is Great Britain and Germany and France and Russia and China and other nations. I doubt that there is one country amongst those I mentioned which has a desire to see Iran, with its fundamentalist, Islamic, extremist government, possessing nuclear weapons.","There is nothing that I'd love to do more than negotiate with Palestinians. This is my desire. This is my dream. This is my mission.","I don't know that there is one serious American representative that will advise Israel to sit with a terrorist government and negotiate with them.","For me to propose a division of Jerusalem was really terrible. I did it because I reached a conclusion that without which there will not be peace.","I love my country more than anything else.","I think the attempt to draw a comparison between Iran and Syria is false, misleading and dangerous.","I am focused on what needs to be done for the people of Israel. Period. I do not pity myself and I do not pat myself on the shoulder. I get up in the morning full of energy to fulfill my mission.","I want to arrive at the possibility of peace with the Syrians, and when I believe that the conditions are right, I will not miss the opportunity.","My doctors say I am very healthy.","The Palestinians are facing a historic junction at which they will have to decide whether they want to remain stuck in a corner of extreme fundamentalism, which will cut them off from the entire world, or whether they are ready to take the necessary steps. My role is to assist in building this process.","Who thinks seriously that if we sit on another hilltop, on another hundred meters, that this is what will make the difference for the state of Israel's basic security?","I never thought that Syria and Israel should engage in a violent confrontation because I don't think that there is any particular interest for any of us to do it.","Israel always has to be in a position to defend itself against any adversary and against any threat of any kind.","Look, miracles in the Middle East are a reality.","Peace is important for Israel.","Iran is an anti-Semitic, terrorist government.","Israel will not tolerate a situation in which Iran has effective control of non-conventional weapons that can be used directly against the state of Israel.","I have to think about the possible ramifications of an early retirement.","I was not born to be prime minister, and I'm not going to stay here until the end of my life. I'm too young for that.","I sometimes feel tired. But there are so many reasons for being tired.","I'm not in power, but my ideas are in power. And my ideas will prevail.","There were certain people who were out to get me. I know who those people were. They exist, believe me. They know that I know. They spent millions of dollars in order to try to get rid of me. I'm happy they lost most of their money.","I know I'm unpopular.","Iran is a major threat to the well-being of Europe and America just as much as it is for the state of Israel.","I know the war in Iraq is controversial in the States, but for us in the Middle East it has made a great and significant impact.","Merkel is an amazing woman, very experienced in international politics.","Politicians are strong to the extent that they are ready to take serious decisions and fight for it.","A bloc of states is emerging that understands that they may have been wrong to think that Israel is the world's greatest problem.","Saudi Arabia is the country that in the end will determine the ability of the Arabs to reach a compromise with Israel.","There is no doubt that there is a very strange phenomenon called the 'State Comptroller.'","When armed people from Hamas and armed people from Fatah are standing opposite each other, there is more likely to be a confrontation amongst them.","It's a problem sometimes when you speak to journalists. They quote you, and then they read what they wrote, and then they even explain it. It's dangerous.","The days that Israel was separated from Europe are gone.","For me, Arik Sharon - I remember his courage and inspiration. I want to remember him the way he really was, not as an aging 80-year-old man living in bed helpless and unconscious.","The fundamental interest - long-range strategic interest - of the state of Israel is that we will have the international bodies and primarily the United Nations recognize the two-state solution, so that there will never be any doubt as to the right of Israel to have its own Jewish independent state.","I don't understand this pathetic need for luxuries.","I don't expect to be coddled, but I'm also a human being.","The newspapers are always reminding the public that I am an unpopular prime minister.","What do you prefer? A prime minister obsessed with being popular, or a prime minister who does the job?","Israel has the power to protect itself and its citizens.","There is always a human being behind the titles and the status.","I've been mayor of the city of Jerusalem, which is perhaps, in some ways, more complex and more difficult than a ministerial position.","We are the greatest experts in the world in criticizing our country, but no one loves his country more than the Israelis. No one.","Arafat is the greatest instigator of terror.","The situation of any leader in the Middle East is not easy.","Abu Mazen has got to do only one thing: to fight terror. That's what he needs to do.","Maaele Adumim is part of Israel. Gush Etzion is part of Israel.","I'm not saying it was wrong to intervene in Kosovo.","I can tell you that if I'd had an opportunity to meet with King Abdullah of the Saudis - which I have not - he would be very surprised to hear what I have to say.","I'm not in the most comfortable position, but I think my government is very stable, perhaps more stable than any government in modern Israeli history.","I trust the integrity of the British government and the British soldiers.","Israel is prepared for a compromise. The majority of Israelis understand this compromise will be serious, will be meaningful, and will be painful.","When it was not very comfortable, politically, for me, I said things which lots of people didn't like, some of them may have liked. I said my beliefs, my truth, and my convictions, and that's how I am going to continue to do in the future.","I was not interested in being minister of defense or minister of foreign affairs.","The Goldstone Committee was formed in April of 2009, after I was not prime minister. So it was a new political situation.","Before I became prime minister, as mayor of Jerusalem, I became world-renowned because of my fight for the unity of Jerusalem."],"Eike Batista":["What I learned from my father is to think big.","You cannot exist as a $20 billion company with speculation.","Finding oil is a multidisciplinary science.

I don't like chauffeurs, either. I like to be in charge of my own destiny.","I really prefer light-eyed models, They photograph more easily. Of course, I come from a light-eyed background, so maybe that influenced my taste.","American women mean a great deal to me. They're such lost souls, particularly the women of my generation. And women need so much help. They never have anyone to turn to. I help them understand how they can look better, how to do this, do that, get a job. And they're very trusting. Like little lost kids.","Most of our models have just walked in off the streets, although I also find them on countless trips to Europe - particularly Scandinavia. I operate by instinct. It's a process I cannot explain, but the prettiest girl on the block is not always the best model.","I had a nice, pert nose but a plain round face and a mop of curly brown hair. That was not the photograph of a successful model.","I got everything I wanted from my parents: Brooks Brothers sweaters and Spalding saddle shoes.","None of the people I grew up with had identity problems. We all had perfectly marvelous lives.","My family believed I could do no wrong. That's probably why I have utter confidence in myself even when I shouldn't have.","The horrible thing about being me is that I have a very good eye about what people look like. Even me.","I can't add above 10, I can't draw a stick figure, and I'm tone deaf. So I had to be able to do something. I found that something was picking successful models.","Grace Kelly was a very commercial model; she had no interest in being a fashion model. None at all.","I never worry about fat people worrying about thin people, because slender people bury the dead.","I interview about three thousand models yearly, and I must see almost 20 tons of excess avoirdupois annually.","Our business was built on trust.","Most models are emotionally abandoned. They need me. I'm their mother.","Models are a business, and they have to treat themselves as a business, which means they have to take care of themselves and give up all the young joys.","We couldn't afford to move, so we decided to start up a model agency.","You never know when or where you will find the next new model, but you can bet someone from Ford Models will be looking.","I suppose you could say that I majored in men and minored in psychology.","Jerry didn't know he wanted to get married until he was married.","I don't think of people as black or white. It's a question of are they photogenic or not? I don't think anyone says, 'Let's book her. She's black.' I think they say, 'Let's book her. She's good.' We've come that far.","I see girls that I know - I absolutely know - will be star models within just a matter of weeks, and they always are."],"Eileen Myles":["Dogs are a companion species. It's about time - you have an animal for about 15, 16 years, a generation. That time holds so much. You might have had five or six relationships with human beings but one dog.","With Instagram, you're captioning a moment. Twitter is the caption without the image. Even if it's there, the words come first.","I always aimed at being a legend.","If I had been a good student and an achiever, I might have been excited by a more systematic approach to writing than what I do.","To be a poet, it's a challenge to do it in poverty, to do it in wealth. To do it in the academy, to do it in a relationship where you're happy. Everything changes the game. To do it in the awkward state of love, despair, dying. You just have to work it.","Older men get lovable, and older women get monstrous.","The poet is like the earth's shadow. The sun moves, and the poet writes something down.","Evolution is not an even process. There are surges, and there are micromoments. Certainly a career as an artist is that way.","Poetry always, always, always is a key piece of democracy.","As things get worse, poetry gets better because it becomes more necessary.","I've grown to love Barack Obama. Hillary is no Bernie Sanders. But she's a politician, and she understands Congress. And I think with that kind of twisted beauty, she could lead our country.","A vote should be generative, not like business as usual, which is what voting feels like for most of us.","Having big audiences when you're on a book tour is like Valhalla if you're a person who used to sell Girl Scout cookies on the side. Because you want to give the reading that will sell the most books.","I really just love reading. It's my favorite thing, performing my poems live. Reading by reading, I just kind of follow my nose.","The thing about not being historically a mainstream writer is that everyone feels like you're theirs: you're their friend.","Everybody loved me running for president in '91 and '92 because they never knew a presidential candidate before.","I thought 'Chelsea Girls' was going to change my life.","I wasn't afraid of being poor. I didn't want to live in a big house. I'm the perfect size for poetry. I can move around.","I've had a lifelong waiting-for-the-other-shoe-to-drop feeling when something good happens.","I wake up with a sense of wonder. I don't dread the future. I like it.","I tend to view my life as an accident, almost as a dream.","Sunday is a likely day to write a poem. Because poetry is a piece of language flying around: you'll find notebooks, something on your phone. It's about finding them and getting them off that crumpled piece of paper and onto my computer.","The first time I voted, I voted for Eugene McCarthy and I knew he wouldn't win, but it felt so great to vote for him, to vote for the right guy - the one who wanted peace.","Lyndon Johnson, I know for a fact, was a great president. And I don't mean by that he was a great man.","I'd like to sit down with Hillary Clinton onstage and ask her about Glass Steagall and all the big banks and her own campaign contributions.","Weirdly, the past starts to be about something else. It becomes about style in a way that it wasn't about, and I don't mean writing style, but cultural style.","When we have relationships with animals, we often make up who they are.","If you have a dog, and you're a person whose moods are constantly changing, there's a moment when you look at the dog, and you feel bad for them because they're attached to you, and so it's funny for the dog to vocalize those things in some ways.","I was like the family clown. The middle child entertaining. I was a lousy student, but interestingly, the nuns always let me write plays or do drawings, endless special projects.","When somebody's in love with you, they think it's amazing you've written them a poem, and when they don't love you anymore, they hate those poems. They wish those poems would go away.","In Arlington, people would laugh at you if you tried to get people to look at your drawings or listen to your poetry. It was like you thought you were special.","It's a big statement if you use the word 'America' in the title of your poem.","Poetry from the bottom up is an act of selection: you kind of feel your way through the crowds of poems. The good ones came forward a long time ago, and the bad ones fell away.","I didn't know how to write a novel, so I sort of let it happen in waves. The only way I could write it was to think like scenes in a movie.","I made myself into a poet because it was the first thing I really loved. It was an act of will.","Who doesn't want to be famous? I am famous. I'm dying to be on TV.","I'm using my degree. You know, I studied English and American literature in college, and now I'm an American poet.","As a human being, I'm kind of a cheery melancholic. I have energy; I'm happy.","Fred Moten is a poet I really love because he changes who is telling the poem all the time.","I'm the weird poet who has paid her dues in the experimental world for 30 or 40 years.","I'm proud that I've never stopped writing about being poor.","The only job that ever really worked for me was teaching because you are your own master once you get into the room. You just have to show up on time and talk about what you care about.","The most exciting thing is to read a poem out loud for the first time.","When I'm writing the poem, I feel like I have to close my eyes. I don't mean literally, but you invite a kind of blindness, and that's the birth of the poem.","If the poetry world celebrate its female stars at the true level of their productivity and influence, poetry would wind up being a largely female world, and the men would leave.","Certainly in the arts, in all genres, I think that men should step away. I think men should stop writing books. I think men should stop making movies or television. Say, for 50 to 100 years.","Somehow, the whole idea of me writing art reviews was just too much of a complicated thought, but I liked art, and later on I just realized that it would be perhaps a pleasure, and so I decided to do it for 'Art in America' - a lot.","I love Canada, and I dated someone who was Canadian a few years ago, and she brought me into a deeper understanding of the greatness of the culture.","I started writing poems, and when I first tried prose, I wrote bad articles and essays and columns, and I didn't have a handle on it. I didn't go to a school that really taught you how to write that stuff.","In my family, I'm the middle of three, and I'm like a lot of middle children. I was one of those kids that floated from group to group. I liked being able to be included in all the groups - the bad kids, the smart kids.","I'm not against wealth; I just think everybody should have it, same as health.","Literature is love. I think it went like this: drawings in the cave, sounds in the cave, songs in the cave, songs about us. Later, stories about us.","Poetry and novels are lists of our devotions. We love the feel of making the marks as the feelings are rising and falling.","Living in literature and love is the best thing there is. You're always home."],"Eileen Pollack":["Science and math are hard for everybody, and it's usually not a matter or being born gifted at it or not. It's hard work, but it can be a lot of fun!","Judging the political climate in my state by walking around lefty Ann Arbor is like a polar bear judging global warming by staring at the ice cube beneath its feet.","I don't usually feel threatened by the militias. Most members are just indulging their fantasies of being warriors without having to sign up for the Army. They want to be heroes and save their neighbors from disaster.","Figuring out why people who choose not to do something don't in fact do it is like attempting to interview the elves who live inside your refrigerator but come out only when the light is off.","Given that many girls are indoctrinated to believe that they should be feminine and modest about their abilities, as well as brought up to assume that girls are not innately gifted at science or math, it is not surprising that so few can see themselves as successful computer scientists.","To make computer science more attractive to women, we might help young women change how they think about themselves and what's expected of them. But we might also diversify the images of scientists they see in the media, along with the decor in the classrooms and offices in which they might want to study or work.","In America, nobody's boyfriend wants them to be smarter than he is, and no one wants to admit it.","For women, even if she's nerdy enough to be Steve Jobs, she's undateable.","Parents don't want their kids to be nerdy.","We forget how recently astronomers figured out what the stars are made of, what makes them shine, how distant they are, how they are born, and whether they remain immutable or evolve and die.","If a female student wants to drop a physics course, no one questions her, but if a male student tries to drop it, he will get pushback and encouraged to stay in, since he will need it later in life.","When you have different kinds of scientific and mathematical minds approaching problems, you will get more solutions. This leads to more innovation and more creative design.","Success in math and the hard sciences, far from being a matter of gender, is almost entirely dependent on culture - a culture that teaches girls math isn't cool and no one will date them if they excel in physics.","My brother had been given a chemistry set for his bar mitzvah, but he wasn't interested in it. It was upstairs in the attic, and I would sneak up there and use it at great peril because I was afraid if he found out, he would get very angry at me, but he didn't seem to care.","When I was in seventh grade, I was bored out of my mind. We seemed to be learning the same things over and over in science and math, and two of the boys in my class were allowed to move ahead into these advanced classes, but I wasn't allowed because I was a girl.","Combating any kind of obstacle is much easier if you know that it's real and not your fault, and it's something you can fight against.","The most powerful determinant of whether a woman goes on in science might be whether anyone encourages her to go on.","When I was in 7th grade, we were all given an exam. It was science and math, and the boys who did well were skipped ahead so that when they got to be juniors or seniors in high school they would be able to go to the local community college and take calculus and physics there. And I wasn't skipped ahead.","I think women need to hear more encouragement in any field, because I see it - I teach creative writing. And even though it's mostly women in the room, they're not often - or they didn't used to be the ones who went on to publish books. I know this sounds like a tautology, but encouragement is the key.","If a person's self-worth derives from being the only woman in the field, how much affection can she feel toward another woman who might challenge that claim to fame?","If you're the only anything in the room, you're going to feel so self-conscious of your right to be there.","If there's a stereotype that you're not supposed to be good at something, that still gets so badly in your way of concentrating.","If you're a white male growing up in this society, you're constantly receiving encouragement to go on in science in the form of all the images that you're receiving.","All the societal pressures that make girls feel as if they're too smart, especially in the sciences - 'No one will date them. They won't be popular.' - don't apply to boys. The boys are being encouraged.","Wandering the book fair at AWP is a great way to get acquainted with a wide sampling of the diverse journals that are out there and the wide sampling of people who produce them.","For the individual and for society, the more diversity you have in a field means more ways of solving a problem as well as more creativity and originality.","The truth is, the less a subject had to do with the visible world, the more talented I was at solving problems.","I was nearly as far behind in calculus as I was in physics. But I wasn't the only woman in the class, so I felt more comfortable asking questions.","As a physics major at Yale in the 1970s, I developed crushes on nearly all my male professors.","Many of my friends are scientists.","Knowing how to tactfully criticize someone's work is a mentor's job.","The world is a complex place.","Most applicants to creative writing programs submit stories about the angst of their suburban childhoods.","Writers find common ground not through the homelands they once inhabited but the thematic questions with which they grapple.","When I left Yale, it was so painful to me. I had worked so hard, gotten so far, and just walked away.","I write and teach creative nonfiction. I was a reporter.","When I was growing up, I wanted passionately to be a physicist.","When parents ask why there are still so few girls in advanced science and math classes in high school, I tell them, because girls still need way more encouragement than boys to take those courses.","We still raise girls to look to other people for assurance they are attractive and smart, while boys are raised to determine their own value. Many girls are still made to feel it's not feminine to be good at science or math.","My parents didn't know how to provide me with the encouragement I needed to achieve my dreams.","I miss my former teachers, John Hersey and James Alan McPherson. I would love to see either or both and ask what I could do to improve, to deepen my writing."],"Eion Bailey":["I've been to Bali twice and Marrakech twice. I thought Vienna was great. I will take girlfriends to places they've never been before.","I've done two USO Tours, one in the Middle East and one in Asia, and spent time with the troops.","I'm very interested in soldier recovery projects and in Bradley Manning's story, the army intelligence officer who's being held as a detainee and is going to trial for crimes of treason."],"Eisaku Sato":["It was also during my tenure of office that the Japanese Government agreed to the conclusion of a Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and signed it, pursuing a policy in harmony with the avowed desire of the people.","All through the years since World War II, the Japanese people have, I am convinced, made strenuous efforts to preserve and promote world peace, contributing to the progress and prosperity of mankind.","Japan is the only country in the world to have suffered the ravages of atomic bombing. That experience left an indelible mark on the hearts of our people, making them passionately determined to renounce all wars.","It is the earnest hope of our people that the world may see the day when all nuclear weapons are abolished.","If the attainment of peace is the ultimate objective of all statesmen, it is, at the same time, something very ordinary, closely tied to the daily life of each individual.","Subsequently, the Japanese people experienced a variety of vicissitudes and were involved in international disputes, eventually, for the first time in their history, experiencing the horrors of modern warfare on their own soil during World War II.","It is only natural that for any statesman at the helm of any government the question of his country's security should be a concern of the utmost importance.","The international order established at the end of World War II could certainly have been worse. However, this order did contain certain factors which bore within them the seeds of instability.","The desire to see Okinawa returned to Japan developed into a broad national consensus among our people."],"Eiza Gonzalez":["I'm born and raised in Mexico. I only spent eight months in the States, but definitely English is a really big part of my life, and I love it. Thank God my mom put me in American school because I'm able to be working in the States, and it opens a lot more doors being half and not being only one. It's cool because I get to turn it on and off.","When I was a girl, there wasn't anything in Spanish in the movies until you saw it on DVD.","I'm happy and I'm focused on my work... it's incredible to be able to work with 20th Century Fox and to keep opening doors for Mexicans and Latins in the United States.","I studied in American school, so yes, I grew up speaking English and Spanish. Obviously, Spanish is my first language.","I can have an accent and not have an accent, so it's really cool. I can play with it. I can be very Sofia Vergara, too, so it's really cool.","My last audition for 'Baby Driver,' I had to meet with Jon Hamm and go through the scenes. I was a bit nervous: 'What if Jon Hamm dislikes me? This is the end.' I also watched 'Mad Men' religiously, so that didn't help with my nerves.","When my father passed away, I learned to be unattached to physical things. At a very young age, I was able to roam the world and be emotionally connected but physically disconnected. I'll get homesick in that I miss my mom. My grounding rock is her and my family.","I'm a perfectionist, which is bad at times but very good at other times.","I speak Italian and a little bit of French. I moved to Trento, Italy, when I was around 10 to learn Italian. I have family there. I'm trying to restart my French. And then I want to get into Mandarin.","I love being Latina. I love our values, the way we're so in touch with others, our dark humor, how fun we are, how relaxed we are. I love how hard working, independent, and ambitious we are.","I use a lot of sunblock, which is something I learned from my mother at a young age - to stay out of the sun and be careful of skin cancer. We live in a time where global warming is at its maximum level. The ozone is destroyed, and our skin is exposed to sunbeams on a daily basis.","I like to tell little girls that not every day is going to be your best day and that you won't look pretty every day either and that that's OK. But it is important to take care of yourself.","I feel I have a great responsibility to be an active Latina. I've been rallying for DACA, and in the summer, I'll be rallying again so that people are aware that if certain senators are elected they can help impeach Donald Trump.","I lost my father very young, but not young enough to not be aware of what was going on. My father and I had an amazing relationship. We were very close.","My mom was very much alpha. I admired her because she was the working mom on the go. She's such a boss. She's an OG, as they say.","It's really hard to have your voice heard in a man's world. People are always comparing women and bringing them down - that, I'm completely against. We have an obligation as women to not pit ourselves against each other, because men are going to do it for us.","It blows my mind - whenever you're stuck in one place, you think this is how the world is, and then you walk out and see there's so many layers to everything.","This sounds crazy, but I was born in the fashion industry. So, I probably wore heels by the age of two. When I was two, I would steal my mom's heels.","I always say that what's between you and your success is yourself.","I'm an actress that's game for anything. I would love to do a movie like 'Winter's Bone.'","I love written books and novels, but I really love graphic novels and comic books!","Never suntan! Ten minutes in the sun on a daily basis is good to get vitamin D, but sun tanning is terrible for your skin. It dehydrates your skin, creates sunspots, and can give you skin cancer.","I get a blood test every six months to narrow down what could be causing fatigue, exhaustion, dark thoughts, and obviously, eventually, how to be in my top shape. Blood doesn't lie. From vitamins that I'm lacking to natural foods, it's an educated guide to connect my physical internal and external look.","Rock climbing and surfing are two of my favorite things in life.","Any neuroscience book is the death of me. I'm currently obsessed with 'The Moral Landscape' from Sam Harris. He's a controversial writer addressing science and religion while talking about the deep undertaking of your brain.","I want Latinos to be seen as the hard-working people that we are. We'll take the hardest jobs that no one wants to take, and we'll do them with dignity.","When my father passed away, my mom didn't really know what to do and how to deal with it for me, so she put me in extracurricular classes, one of them being theater."],"Ekaterina Gordeeva":["Family is always the most important part.","I knew there were a lot of friends out there, and I wanted to be with them.","I like to cook good meals, especially when I have a lot of time.","I love that I have a job that I love.","I'm almost a full-time mom.","To come back on the ice was hard, and at the same time it was kind of a healing process."],"Eknath Easwaran":["Patience can't be acquired overnight. It is just like building up a muscle. Every day you need to work on it.","Through meditation and by giving full attention to one thing at a time, we can learn to direct attention where we choose.","It takes a lot of experience of life to see why some relationships last and others do not. But we do not have to wait for a crisis to get an idea of the future of a particular relationship. Our behavior in little every incidents tells us a great deal."],"El DeBarge":["I'm too grateful to be hateful. I am too blessed to be stressed.","Like everyone else in this world, I have had struggles. There's disappointment and obstacles in everybody's life. I feel like I was writing 'Second Chance' not just for myself, but also for the people who have struggled.","God gave me a second chance. I am so very glad with what is going on with my career, but I want to be a success in my relationship with my children.","I know that I'm here because of the grace of God. But I also know that I've been given this second chance for a specific reason, and that is to bring love to the world again through the voice of my music, and I'm so honored to be able to do it. I'm so blessed that God has chosen me to do that.","I'm a nice guy, but not all the time. There are these personalities in me, so many of them. They come out at strange times. I can be one way, then five minutes later I'm another way.","I hit rock bottom before I even went there. Actually, prison was the rescue mission that God had put on me. He sent out his angels to rescue me. In prison, he protected me the whole time I was in there, and it was just for me to get my will power back, to get my strength back, get my focus together.","I want the world to know that everybody deserves a second chance.","When I think about that first DeBarge album, I remember being so green... just pristine. Nothing mattered to me but writing songs. I remember staying locked up in a room with my piano and just singing and writing songs all day long. I remember being a perfectionist about it... wanting to change this and fix that.","The way you can be careful of the catastrophe that success can bring is by paying attention to something else that comes along with success - responsibility.","When I write songs, when I sing songs, I don't have anybody in mind. I'm just trying to express what I think people are feeling.","Music really helps me. It's like a best friend.","Keep your eye on what you're responsible to and what you're responsible for, and that'll keep you right.","When your will power is gone, you are helpless.","BET, I'll never, never, ever forget them for this wonderful blessing they gave to me, to be on the 10th annual BET awards for my comeback.","I'm not crazy. But I am different. I'm still learning about myself.","I fight these strange personalities by getting into music.","I was in no way ready when my daughter was born. But I want to be a good father to her.","There's a little bit of gospel in everything I do. But I don't know if I will ever do a gospel album. There's a big universe out here, and I don't want to just sing to the church. I want to sing to the world and bring them a message of love. I love going to church and singing gospel songs, but right now there's a message that the world needs.","RZA is one of the most unique individuals and rap artists that I have worked with.","God has been God in my life ever since I can remember.","The devil is busy and trying to distort and adulterate the things that are the pure essence of God.","God strengthened me and taught me who I am in Him. He taught me that not only do I need to have faith in Him, but I need to believe in myself again.","There's music to dance to and make love to, music to cry to. I'm starting from scratch, coming fresh. But my sound still embodies the same soulful, intricate harmonies.","There's a certain missing feeling, a void out there that I'm more than happy to fill. Without criticizing what's out there now, I'm just going to do El DeBarge.","My voice, I'm blessed to have it.","I'm not like other writers. I'm not hung up on using my own songs. In fact, my sister Bunny always tells me I sing other people's songs better than my own. She says I loosen up and give the songs a different feel.","It gets lonely. I miss my family on stage. This might change one day. I'm certainly not going to say I'm not going to work with them again.","The piano has been my friend all my life; it has always comforted me. Writing songs and sitting down at the piano is not only a business, it's a hobby I enjoy."],"Elaine Chao":["Never far from my thoughts are memories of being a little girl in Queens, N.Y., our family of five crowded in a small one-bedroom apartment, struggling to learn English and survive a new life in a new country, America. We humbly and gratefully still recall the kindnesses shown by strangers and neighbors who became new friends.","As I looked up at the Statue of Liberty, I thought at that time, 'What a wonderful country.'","It has long been said the only things in life that are certain are death and taxes. Automatic enrollment for insurance of 401k loans would add an additional certainty. Fewer Americans would suffer the unnecessary loss of retirement savings due to unanticipated and untimely misfortune in an already stressful time of need.","As we celebrate Women's History Month this March, it's important to remember the key role women have played in promoting a better understanding and relationships between our country and the rest of the world.","To maintain their own competitiveness, workers need to attain and stay current on the qualifications needed to advance in a constantly evolving economy.","Consider trade protectionism. It's been tried - and found wanting - since the Great Depression.","Smoot and Hawley ginned up The Tariff Act of 1930 to get America back to work after the Stock Market Crash of '29. Instead, it destroyed trade so effectively that by 1932, American exports to Europe were just a third of what they had been in 1929. World trade fell two-thirds as other nations retaliated. Jobs evaporated.","We have a lot of employers who are looking for skilled workers and not being able to find them. And we have workers who lack the requisite skills to access these good-paying jobs in high growth industries.","Activists have every right to espouse their views of utopia.","Outside of Washington, D.C., most Americans aren't concerned with doing things 'big.' They're looking for less government spending, lower taxes, and good jobs.","In normal times, laid-off workers are unemployed an average of eight weeks.","While conventional wisdom has traditionally sided against borrowing from retirement savings, sentiment has shifted toward borrowing from one's own assets with the realization that other forms of credit come at a much higher cost and often are not even available to borrowers with limited means and urgent needs.","The work of these women doesn't end when they return home from overseas, as one goal of the Peace Corps' mission is to help promote a better understanding of other cultures here in the United States.","Deep in the heart of Kentucky's rugged Eastern Mountain region, there lives a woman who has fascinated and inspired me for two decades. She is known locally these days as 'Mayor Nan' - the octogenarian chief executive of Hazard and advocate for its 5,467 residents.","If we did not have Obamacare, we could've addressed the healthcare crisis in a comprehensive but segmented fashion - meaning that we could have promoted a health savings plan. We could've pushed for tort reform, which added so much more cost to healthcare.","The greatest job creation is driven by entrepreneurs and young businesses, so they merit special attention.","To better deal with shortages of qualified applicants now and in the future, government policy makers need to acknowledge that government job training programs could stand improvement.","Confidence, capital, and credit fuel entrepreneurship and economic expansion.","Most private sector workers can only dream of getting the generous lifetime pension and health benefits typical of government service.","We have many rules and regulations that can be sometimes confusing and complicated. By reaching out to the employer community and educating them on what their responsibilities and obligations are to their work force, that, along, with strong enforcement, is the best way to protect workers.","I'm the first secretary of labor in the 21st century, and the competitiveness of the American work force and the modernization of decades-old regulations have been among our top priorities.","My husband has an outstanding record in promoting opportunity for women and the women that he surrounds himself in his staff and the women that he has promoted throughout his career. He's the father of three daughters. He's obviously a husband who's been very supportive of a very active wife with her own career.","Our country needs to produce 250,000 net new jobs every month just to keep even with population growth.","In campaigns, lots of things will be said, and what they have said about my husband is just simply not true.","Typically, after moving backwards, the economy takes even more steps forward.","It's not coincidental that America's vigorous recovery in the early 1980s was led by a president who worked hard to unshackle growth in the private sector.","Our private-sector work force is the most industrious, innovative, productive, and ambitious in the world.","We want to make sure that workers know their rights and that employers know their obligations. That is the best way to protect workers.","I know what it is like to feel vulnerable and fearful during a difficult time.","We're a robust democracy here.

We are also a country where there will be criticism.","When there's change, people are always anxious.","I can tell you I love California - and no more.","Those memories of living in a developing nation are part of who I am today and give me a profound understanding of the challenges of economic development - an understanding which will make my tenure as Peace Corps director, I hope, a very special one.","My first port of call was Los Angeles. That's where I laid my first foot on America.","I am not seeking any position in a Dole Administration.","Every person - we want to make sure that every person who wants a job will indeed get one.","When my mother, sisters and I arrived on the shores of America when I was 8 years old, the boat on which we came, a freighter, passed the Statue of Liberty.","Even if it's a national issue, the federal government cannot provide all the answers.","The ingenuity and creativity of the private sector is essential to meeting American's needs for a skilled work force.","Progress is being made, but a lot of women are realizing it is not what they envisioned.","We need fair and free trade.","We are a Republic with different branches of government, and so the Senate and the House are going to be full partners in working with the White House.","For any trade deal to move forward, there has to be agreement.","I know that some people, when they are growing up and they - as a person of color in a majority community - that they may feel as if they are left out, or they feel a bit strange.","My parents were very supportive.","I will carry with me always the deep sense of what it feels like to be an outsider and how tough it was, how hard it was to adapt to this country.","My parents were very, very strict parents, and they were not used to this new, you know, American custom of letting your children sleep in someone else's house.","What out country is facing right now is a skills gap.","The majority of the new jobs being created require higher skills, more education.","I love working in the garden.","Washington policymakers have to understand the adverse implications of their actions on job creation, and they must reorder some of their priorities.","In the best of years, millions of jobs are lost.","Even when America's economy has been by all measures healthy and the unemployment rate low, some businesses suffer or fail and lay off workers. But nearly always, a simultaneous and even greater burst of new jobs has been created to offset the jobs lost - millions of new jobs every year.","401k savings accounts have become so important in the landscape of retirement planning that their security and expansion became a top priority in formulating and implementing the Pension Protection Act of 2006 that was enacted during my tenure as the U.S. Secretary of Labor.","Nan Gorman was born in Memphis, Tenn., on St. Patrick's Day. She moved to Hazard in 1929 when her father, James Hagan, a recent medical school graduate and aspiring surgeon, went to work there.","When Peace Corps was first proposed, some in Congress assumed that only men would be volunteers.","There are many reasons to worry; the evening news is full of them.","Perhaps the original layaway angel knew from experience, or simply deduced, that people resorting to the old-fashioned installment method of layaway may be struggling financially.","Because of these layaway angels, many children did not have to wonder why Santa skipped them in 2011.","Though the National Bureau of Economic Research deemed the recession to have ended in June 2009, to most Americans, that conclusion seems not to square with reality.","Three years after the four deepest previous recessions began - in 1953, 1957, 1973 and 1981 - employment was on average 4.7% higher than the pre-recession peak.","While there have been news reports of recent college graduates living with their parents because they have been unable to find a job paying a salary sufficient to move out, their near and long-term career prospects remain far brighter than for those without a college degree.","We Americans typically are more positive about our individual futures, which we have some control over, than we are the nation's or the world's, which we see largely through the media prism.","News-free existence is not a serious proposal, but it is worth noting that while today's 24/7 media environment is wonderful in many ways, it can also be like drinking out of a fire hose and intensify a downward reinforcing cycle of despair.","Confidence, capital, and new markets fuel entrepreneurship and job-generating expansion of existing businesses.","For significant job creation to occur, prospective entrepreneurs and current business owners must not fear the future or be under assault from their own government in the present.","Capital available for individuals to start and expand businesses would increase with regulatory and strategic tax reforms, like reducing marginal rates, repealing the alternative minimum tax, and making the U.S. the most welcoming place for employers to relocate and create jobs.","America needs a new approach to boost the economy - one that does not doom future generations to being saddled with paying off today's federal deficits.","Policymakers, elected and unelected, need to be ever-mindful that the U.S. economy does not exist in isolation.","There should be an immediate moratorium on federal regulations that endanger jobs.","We need long-term tax reform that promotes private sector job creation. And legislated mandates that kill jobs by raising the cost of payrolls need to be eliminated.","Employers should overcome a myopic quarterly earnings posture and focus on long-term strategies for growth that include investing in their own skills-training efforts to enable a broader pool of applicants.","America's competitive advantage lies in its human talent. All of us should be doing everything we can to cultivate and develop our work force.","America's private sector job creators need elected leaders to lead and get out of the way.","Around the time President Lyndon B. Johnson was declaring a War on Poverty in the 1960s, federal, state and local governments began accelerating a veritable War on the Private Sector.","President Obama has been admirably pro-trade in public remarks, but there has been no progress in moving any new free trade agreements to expand exports abroad and create jobs at home.","The expenses of complying with Washington's torrent of mandates and regulatory overreach are costing American workers jobs and income growth.","Washington's parasitic approach to the private sector must change for there to be widespread, near-term and enduring prosperity and job creation.","The borrow-spend-and-centralize agenda that has been so destructive to job creation elsewhere in America has been a gravy boat inside the Beltway.","Even a healthy economy and labor market would have struggled under the additional expenses enacted and proposed in 2009 and 2010 - from healthcare mandates and higher taxes, to carbon cap-and-trade and delay in extending the last decade's tax reforms.","To foster entrepreneurship, expansion and job creation, more leaders at all levels of government have to demonstrate some understanding of what it takes to build and grow businesses in the private sector.","As tough as it is for many college graduates to get their planned careers on track, it could be worse: They could be trying to find a job without a college degree.","Government at all levels has kicked the fiscal can down the road for far too long.","Where public pensions are concerned, many jurisdictions are running out of road.","Taxpayers should demand that their states honestly assess public pension plans, accurately measure the assets and liabilities, and take steps to provide fair benefits to public employees that limit taxpayers' liability.","The OPPA route is nothing new. It follows the decades-old liberal agenda on trade, health care, global warming, and mass unionization. That agenda has never brought prosperity to workers.","Rising energy costs kill jobs and hit America's poorest the hardest.","Left-wing shareholder activists seek to leverage the mass economic power of institutional investors such as pension funds, whose managers are supposed to focus strictly on their fiduciary responsibilities to retirees.","Activist shareholder resolutions do not have to pass to succeed. The process itself can be so injurious to a company that management will cave to demands.","The Obama administration likes to say that it is 'pro-worker.' But something is amiss when its labor priorities are forcing unionization and labor contracts on American workplaces, and denying union members information on how their dues money is spent.","The Obama administration's zeal to not 'waste a good crisis,' as Secretary of State Hillary Clinton put it, has been stunning even for Washington insiders to behold.","The Democratic Party's governing elite has long believed there is no problem that European-style policies cannot cure.","European-style interventions to which the Obama administration is inclined will not make America more competitive in the world-wide economy. Such policies will not increase growth, will not decrease unemployment, and will not increase wages for workers.","When the Smoot-Hawley bill landed on President Herbert Hoover's desk, more than 1,000 economists urged him to veto it. Tragically, the president ignored their pleas.","Americans did not suffer alone. World trade overall fell two-thirds in the first few years of the Depression."],"Elaine Dundy":["I hate champagne more than anything in the world next to Seven-Up.","Acting doesn't bring anything to a text. On the contrary, it detracts from it.","To love one that is great, is almost to be great one's self."],"Elaine Irwin":["I'm a vegetarian, but my family isn't. If I can keep everything in my house healthy, I don't have to worry as much when I eat out.","I always try to slip healthy things by my kids. I give them sweet potato French fries and fake chicken nuggets.","I was a bit of a tomboy when I started modeling. And I've always felt athletic and strong.","I never weigh myself. That's the best advice I can give - never step on a scale. You know if you're being healthy, if you're exercising. You don't need to be undermined by some crazy number."],"Elaine MacDonald":["A life coach does for the rest of your life what a personal trainer does for your health and fitness.","If you improve a teacher's self-esteem, confidence, communication skills or stress levels, you improve that teacher's overall effectiveness across the curriculum.","Coaching helps you take stock of where you are now in all aspects of your life, and how that compares to where you would like to be.","Many people still regard many users of public services as undeserving."],"Elaine Pagels":["What survived as orthodox Christianity did so by suppressing and forcibly eliminating a lot of other material.","The Gospel of Judas really has been a surprise in many ways. For one thing, there's no other text that suggests that Judas Iscariot was an intimate, trusted disciple, one to whom Jesus revealed the secrets of the kingdom, and that conversely, the other disciples were misunderstanding what he meant by the gospel.","The author of the Gospel of Judas wasn't against martyrdom, and he didn't ever insult the martyrs. He said it's one thing to die for God if you have to do that. But it's another thing to say that's what God wants, that this is a glorification of God.","Once you start to look at the gospels one by one, you realize that followers of Jesus were trying to understand what had happened after he was arrested and killed. They knew Judas had handed him over to the people who arrested him.","About the gnostic writers themselves and the setting in which they lived we know little, although gnostic Christians were influential enough to be denounced at length.","I study religion because I find it fascinating and problematic. But I struggle with the idea of what religion is, what being religious means. A lot of people assume that if you write about early Christianity, you must be some kind of Sunday-school teacher.","Throughout the ages, Christians have adapted John of Patmos's visions to changing times, reading their own social, political and religious conflicts into the cosmic war he so powerfully evokes. Yet his Book of Revelation appeals not only to fear and desires for vengeance but also to hope.","We don't actually know if the person who wrote the Gospel of John had a written copy of Thomas because we don't know exactly when it was written.","People who are comfortable with very clear boundaries and group definitions don't like the instability and ambiguity of people who say they are more advanced Christians, or they don't have to do what the bishop says.","Fundamentalism does mean reading quite conservatively and literally, saying 'the Bible is the word of God and we have to follow it. What it says is this.'","Christianity becomes just a set of things you believe in. It's almost an intellectual kind of abstract issue.","I just have a sense that, you know, I'm curious about what is religion about, you know? Why do some of us still engage it? It's not because it's a set of old beliefs or old ideas. Or even, particularly, the view that this is the only true religion. Many of us no longer accept those views.","These ancient stories in religion speak to our desire. But they move us toward hope.","I have sympathy for anyone who finds consolation anywhere we can. And many people do find it in religious tradition as it has been. I mean, I love much of that tradition. But somehow, that just didn't speak to me in the way that it does to some.","I had been taught that the separation between religion and politics happened in the Enlightenment. But there were people who tried to create a secular relationship to government 2,000 years ago, and those people were the Jews.","I got to thinking about the Book of Revelation that was written by a Jewish prophet who was also a follower of Jesus who hated the Roman Empire. I realized that the Book of Revelation could be a way to reflect on the issue of religion's relationship to politics.","There is no evidence that the author of the Book of Revelation, John of Patmos, read anything that we think of as a New Testament book. I don't see any evidence that he knew what was in the Gospels, or the letters of Paul, which I don't think he would have liked at all.","The Book of Revelation is all about the conflict, the contest between the forces of Good and Evil.","I realized that conventional views of Christian faith that I'd heard when I was growing up were simply made up - and I realized that many parts of the story of the early Christian movement had been left out.","I realize that I cannot live without a spiritual dimension in my life.","The sense of a spiritual dimension in life is absolutely important, and the religious communities are also important. The question of believing in a set of creedal statements is a lot less important, because I realize the Christian movement thrived then and can now on other elements of the tradition.","The Gospel of Thomas claims to be the secret sayings of Jesus. There are 114 of them, so it says many things, but the central message is that Jesus is the one who reveals the divine light that brought the universe into being, and that you and I also reveal that light.","We use the word 'synoptic' to talk about Matthew, Mark, and Luke, and it really means 'seeing together,' because they all have a similar perspective. Matthew and Luke - whoever wrote those Gospels - used Mark as a focus and as a basic story. So all of them have a lot in common.","What's different about the Gospel of Thomas is that, instead of focusing entirely on who Jesus is and the wonderful works of Jesus, it focuses on how you and I can find the kingdom of God, or life in the presence of God.","People who study the way religions develop have shown that if you have a charismatic teacher, and you don't have an institution develop around that teacher within about a generation to transmit succession within the group, the movement just dies.","The Romans weren't trying to kill all the Jews, but they did destroy Jewish resistance to Roman rule. Jerusalem was turned into a Roman army camp, and it was a total devastation.","The Book of Revelation is such a dream landscape that you can plug any major conflict in it.","The Antichrist is often identified with the second beast in the Book of Revelation that arises from the land, the beast that tries to make everyone worship the power of evil.","I never thought I would write about the Book of Revelation. It's so dense; it's so complex and puzzling. But then I found I was thinking about a number of themes, one of which has to do with politics and religion.","So often, religion is identified in terms coined by Christianity as sets of belief. But I had the sense that it not only involves practice, but also emotion and levels of our experience that are almost precognitive.","The Gospel of Judas is a kind of protest literature. It's challenging leaders of the church.","After Ann Godoff, who was editor-in-chief at Random House, left and went to Viking, I got to know Viking and the people there, and liked them very much. I also found a wonderful editor there, Wendy Wolf. It's a very congenial press.","Unlike many deities of the ancient Near East, the God of Israel shared his power with no female divinity, nor was he the divine husband or lover of any.","Really, I don't like to do any household chores. There was a time when I loved to cook, but that was when I wasn't writing books.","I am enormously susceptible to religious environments - the music, the liturgy and the prayers.","At the end of the day I'll go to a yoga class. I used to say that my work was my yoga, because it stretches everything, expands and challenges everything you know and understand and are.","For nearly 2,000 years, most people assumed that the only sources of tradition about Jesus and his disciples were the four gospels in the New Testament.","What is clear is that the Gospel of Judas has joined the other spectacular discoveries that are exploding the myth of a monolithic Christianity and showing how diverse and fascinating the early Christian movement really was.","Startling as the Gospel of Judas sounds, it amplifies hints we have long read in the Gospels of Mark and John that Jesus knew and even instigated the events of his passion, seeing them as part of a divine plan.","The Book of Revelation is the strangest book in the Bible, and the most controversial. Instead of stories and moral teaching, it offers only visions - dreams and nightmares, the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, earthquakes, plagues and war.","The Secret Revelation of John opens, again, in crisis. The disciple John, grieving Jesus' death, is walking toward the temple when he meets a Pharisee who mocks him for having been deceived by a false messiah. These taunts echoed John's own fear and doubt.","Orthodox theologians insisted that the rest of humankind were only transitory creatures, lost in sin - a view that would support what would become their dominant teaching about salvation, offered only through Christ, and, in particular, through the church they claimed to represent.","There are some kinds of Christianity that insist you have to believe literally in doctrine. The Gnostic gospels open out the complexity and multiplicity of approaches to this. If you think the story of the virgin birth is mistranslated, for instance, it doesn't mean you have to throw out the whole thing."],"Elaine Paige":["I've never been very good at manipulating my career, but fortunately I haven't needed to.","I don't listen to so much music now. I did when I was younger. Music is so much part of my work. I like peace and quiet now when I go home.","Maybe the higher echelons of my range aren't as easily accessible, but that's OK; you change the key.","I received the most fantastic welcome to the Broadway Theatre community. I walked on stage to tremendous applause and a long standing ovation, wondering when I was ever going to be able to say my first line!","One was never taught how to begin at drama school. But all it required was one intake of breath.","I have been extremely pleased to support the Trust's work in the Lupus Unit ever since. Personal experience also motivated me to become involved to help raise the awareness of the disease and hopefully thereby improve the speed of diagnosis.","Just because you are successful in one area does not necessarily mean you're going to be successful in another.","I remember Tim telling me that he had an idea for a musical and he said to me that he was hoping that ABBA would be writing the music, which I thought was a pretty wild idea because they were obviously known very much as pop writers.","I will be singing primarily all the songs from the musicals that I have been in from over the years.","But you know, I'm not 25 anymore, and I have always said musical theater in particular is a young person's game. It requires energy, mentally and physically, to do it.","If you are in a play, and you catch a cold, you are able to muddle through. If you are carrying a musical, it's a different thing altogether. It's the great fear of any singer's life.","'Evita' obviously would always be very special to me because it was the first major musical that I did on stage and created in the U.K. with Hal Prince directing."],"Elaine Sciolino":["Historically, the French have had a romantic attachment to their bikes. Though the first functioning two-wheeler is thought to have been invented by a German in 1817, it was the French who popularized and marketed the device in the 1860s, giving it the name 'bicycle.'","France has become the second-largest consumer of pizza per person, per pound, in the world, behind the United States and ahead of Italy.","In 1991, only two years into the Bush administration, Condoleezza Rice suddenly left her powerful job as the top Russia expert on the National Security Council and went back to California - to get a life.","I guess the biggest surprise I got going to Iran was that the Iranians really liked me as an American.","We often forget that Iran has a long tradition and history with the United States. Iranians have been coming to the United States as students for decades. American businessmen were in Iran developing the oil fields. ...There was an American financial advisor to the Iranian government in the early part of the century.","The Bush administration actually started out with an open mind towards Iran, by all indications. In fact, early in the administration, the White House tasked the various agencies of government to do an inter-agency review of Iran policy, as it did with Iraq policy and most of the big areas of the world.","The first weekend after the attacks of September 11, George W. Bush had a meeting at Camp David with his top advisors, including Colin Powell, the secretary of state. And there was a lively debate about Iraq policy, in which some people from the Pentagon were arguing that the war against terrorism should include Saddam Hussein.","Colin Powell has said over the years that Saddam Hussein is like a toothache. It recurs from time to time, and you just have to live with it. At other times, he's compared Saddam Hussein to a kidney stone that will eventually pass. But he has never said, 'You have to operate and take out the kidney stone.'","Even before September 11, there was a debate in the administration about whether or not military force should be used to oust Saddam Hussein. You're not going to find one person in the top echelons of the foreign policy and national security establishment in the U.S. government who's going to say that Saddam Hussein should not be out of power.","I don't think Iraq could be transformed overnight into a democracy. How can you take a country that doesn't have any kind of tradition of democracy, where its people have been brutalized and repressed for decades, and suddenly impose Jeffersonian ideals?","Francois Hollande, the president of France, and Segolene Royal, a senior cabinet minister who once ran for that post herself, have an exceptionally complicated relationship. The two lived together for 25 years, raising four children over that time.","The position of vice president does not exist in France; neither does a role comparable that of the first lady of the United States.","When Pope Francis touched down on French soil for the first time in his papacy with a visit to the European Parliament in Strasbourg last November, Ms. Royal was the senior French official there to greet him.","Every day since the start of the Tour de France, the popular 'Le Parisien' newspaper has published a story about a book written with the bicycle in mind.","The city of Paris is determined to promote the happiness-on-a-bike fantasy. Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo wants to turn the city into the most bike-friendly capital in the world.","Paris will give bicyclists more rights when it installs 4,300 signs throughout the city, allowing them to barrel though red lights and turn right on red.","Massoumeh Ebtekar is the highest-ranking woman in Iran's government, a symbol of President Mohammed Khatami's promise to promote women into high-profile positions.","In 1981, Ms. Ebtekar was made editor-in-chief of the English-language newspaper 'Kayhan International.' The man who gave her the job was Mr. Khatami, who was then head of the Kayhan publishing house.","When the sommelier Enrico Bernardo moved to Paris from Italy nearly two decades ago, the world of French gastronomy brutally rejected him. No matter that he had won the competition for best sommelier in Italy; when he asked 30 restaurateurs for work in their wine cellars, all turned him down.","The Italian Renaissance extends beyond food, of course. Just about every major Italian furniture designer now has a shop in Paris, and Le Bon Marche recently opened an outlet for Santa Maria Novella perfumes, elixirs and soaps from Florence on its ground floor."],"Elaine Stritch":["I can't explain chemistry.

I'd feel terrible onstage with a wig. I hate to be so 'Actors Studio'-ish, but I like to feel it's me out there.","As a diabetic, I'm a walking picnic. I have to eat measured amounts of food at certain times.","There's something about it that makes sense, Lent. You give something up, and everything's more joyful.","There will always be ladies who lunch. Always. And apparently they live a long time.","I like glasses so I can go out without my makeup. Just grab your coat and get your hat and go.","I always say, 'If you can't give a reason for the banana peel being in the alley, then don't have the comic slide over it.' Do you understand what I mean? First explain how the banana peel got there quickly. And then there's a reason for all the comedy.","You can't be funny unless you're tragic, and you can't be tragic unless you're funny.","I just serve others through entertaining. That's when I am happy.","If I see a great performance on television, onstage, in the movies, I go to work the next day with a renewed energy and less fear. These great artists take me out of my life and make me want to go there.","I tell the truth, and it has gotten me into a lot of trouble. My dad used to say to me, 'If you tell the truth all day long, you will end up in jail.'","I find it easier to abstain than do a little bit of anything. I'm not a 'little bit' kind of dame. I want it all, whatever I do.","I think taking care of yourself, health-wise, in every way, is a 100 percent winner.","I have not had any of that surgical stuff. I am too curious to find out exactly how I progress every day of my life naturally. That is what fascinates me.","I am not influenced by other human beings. But I am inspired.","There's something that really frightens me - and that's fear.","I'm a hotel baby, absolutely: it's hard to think of a hotel I haven't stayed in.","I think it's the wrong way around to say, 'When you get older move to the country.' I think when you get older you move to New York.","I care about money, very much. I want it. I don't ever want to be without it. My mother once said about me, 'Elaine has to have money.'","When I want to do something badly enough, I do it, but there is a practical side of me that thinks I should be paid fairly.","What I want to understand is what I am talking about on the stage. What I don't want to understand is what the government is talking about when the government tells me about taxes.","I never found anyone who could look after me as well as I could look after myself.","Diabetes is a lousy, lousy disease.","I think the most interesting New Yorkers are the people who were not born here.","I do believe in the infallibility of the Pope, because I think we have to believe in something.","I love reviews. Anybody who tells you they don't read reviews is a liar.","For me, going to London is like coming home. In fact, I've often entertained the idea of ending my days there.","The closer a part is to you, the harder it is to play. Anything else is just imitation. If I'm playing a Russian countess, I get the hat, the accent, the outrageousness. Easy. Playing a murderess? Perfect.","This age thing is all up to you. It's like happiness is up to you. You just have to understand what it is before you get it.","I have no intention of retiring. Even my blood sugar is better when I'm working.","Fear is the base of what everybody does wrong in their lives.","My movie career - if such a thing even exists - is laughable.","Why haven't I made more movies? Nobody asked me.","I don't think there's any thrill in the world like doing work you're good at.","Certain type of actresses get younger instead of older. I always say, 'Only ingenues age.'","When I'm playing comedy, it is such a crap shoot of what will work and what won't.","You cannot tell an audience a lie. They know it before you do; before it's out of your mouth, they know it's a lie.","I don't want to see a movie twice. I don't want to do anything twice.","Audiences are not strangers to me. They're the best friends I've got in my life.","All of the writing on '30 Rock' is a joy to go into. It's pretty hot stuff.","I don't have a great talent for explaining myself in acting because I can't explain it.","Making clever speeches takes a lot of work and a lot of time.","My idea of serenity - that wonderful word that everybody's trying to get into their life - is call-waiting.","I like being talked about. I think some people really don't... because they're secure enough and they don't need that.","I love Birmingham, Michigan. It's lovely - you know, it's very similar to the Hamptons.","The people in New York - their humor is on a level that goes, uh, very deep, you know?","I'm funny when I want to be. And I'm even funny when I don't want to be.","I don't have to go to a doctor and have my face changed. It terrifies me that women do that.","I'm a good acting partner for me... when I don't have anyone else, I do really well!","I love holidays in New York. I love 'em. I want to celebrate something all the time, and New York has holidays for every day of the week, practically.

It alienates people.","Betty White is probably a very nice woman.","New Yorkers stop me on the street all the time to say, 'You're terrific! You're the nuts!'","Let me tell you about those convents. All that crap about extending the pinkie finger while sipping tea is a myth. Convent schools are breeding grounds for great broads and occasionally one-of-the-boys. Convent schools teach you to play against everything, which is what I'm still doing.","These performers that go on about their technique and craft - oh, puleeze! How boring! I don't know what 'technique' means. But I do know what experience is.","Talent is seductive.","There's certainly nothing lasting and definite about the theater.","I compare Stephen Sondheim with humor, because humor is unanalyzable. You can't analyze humor. You just have to get through it.","Honestly, this is a big thing to say, but I don't think I've ever been bored. If I even get an inkling of it, I split.","I think being boring is just the worst sin of all time.","Dying is easy. Comedy is hard.","I never thought about living in New York. I just thought it was great.","I don't want to see my family all the time, and they're delighted, I'm sure, to be aware of that.","Quite frankly I don't know how to be happy. I have not a clue.","There are a lot of things I do that I don't want to, but I have to. It's truly an emotional need for me to perform.","I mention I'm going home, and I'm a star immediately! This used to happen with my boyfriends - as soon as I'd say, 'I gotta go home now,' they fell in love.","Isn't this fantastic, what a star I am?","I don't think I'm gonna die tomorrow or even two weeks from now, or even ever. I just don't know - who the hell knows what's gonna happen to them? Nobody! Isn't that comforting? Nobody has a clue. I like that we don't know. And I like that it's somebody else's decision, not mine.","My biggest dream was to get out of Michigan - to discover life beyond the Sacred Heart Convent.","I like celebrities. I love people who are famous. Always have.","When the hospital sends for me, when the ambulance comes and I ease my way out of the world, I'd rather be in Detroit, Michigan, than Lenox Hill.","I love New York. I went to New York to become an actress, and I did it. And I won all the awards known to man. And I'm happy. And I came home. I came, I saw, I conquered. And it feels great.","I'm loaded with talent.","I loved being on Broadway, but performing has become exhausting, and I just don't want to live in New York anymore. I'm just sick of the competition in New York, the feeling that I always have to rehearse to keep up my performance. I don't feel like rehearsing, even though it should be my favorite thing in the world to do.","I smoked, I drank, I did all the kicking my heels up type things, but I went to Mass on Sunday.","If I see someone saying the rosary in the wings, I know they've got talent.","I love audiences. My God, the best friends in the world!","I think I have more humour in me than anger.

But I had this facade in performance of looking like I wrote the book.","Fans recognize me all over the place. But the second you need anything, they're never around! They're like the police!"],"Elaine Welteroth":["Not gonna lie - having a personal glam squad is pretty amazing.","I think my style is a mix of quirky, eclectic, bright, and fun, with a really sophisticated feminine silhouette.","We live in a multi-cultural world, so embracing diversity is important in every industry.","Personal style says so much about who you are. What you wear can entice different things from within you.","Young people are craving something real, craving authenticity.","I grew up with social media. I am the boomerang queen. I enjoy this. I live this. The day I don't is the day I need to resign.","What is unusual is not always threatening. What is different is not necessarily strange.","Gotta admit, it's kind of nice being surrounded by amazing beauty products 24/7.","I think of our readers as young, conscious people. We can't underestimate how far-reaching our content is, especially these days.","The evolution at 'Teen Vogue' is not a result of dinosaurs in a board room coming up with a strategy to reach the kids.","We don't see ourselves as liberal or conservative. We consider ourselves an outlet that addresses the issues that matter the most to our audience.","Ethical fashion is the future of fashion. Gucci's decision to ban fur is a smart step in the right direction - for the environment, for animal rights, and for its massive base of young brand fans who will soon represent the largest consumer base in history.","I think the word 'woke' is now over. The first time I heard my mature, white dad use that term, I was like 'OK, this is done.'","I don't think there's anything to be ashamed of about being a woman who loves fashion. Fashion is a vehicle for self-expression, it tells the world who you are and how you want to be seen. If you use it as a canvas for creativity, then you might want to talk about it, you know? And I fully embrace that.","I don't believe in work-life balance. I think it's more about work-life integration because, increasingly, so much time of ours is spent doing work, so I've always wanted to dedicate my work life to having a social impact.","When you do your part, life just unfolds in ways that are so much better than you would have dreamed up on your own.","My office is definitely an extension of my personality. I spend more time here than anywhere else, so it's important that it reflects my style and that it's an inspiring place to think - although it's admittedly impossible to keep clean with a gazillion beauty products coming in and out all the time.","I don't think young people are prepared for the moment of reckoning at the end of college - if you even go to college - where you have to get off of the hamster wheel and decide, 'Wait, where do I go from here?'","'Teen Vogue' fortunately has proved you can have smart, political, and fashionable content delivered in one place, and you don't have to choose.","From what I see, people of color are being called on in a different way. We're being heard in a different way - louder. And I think it's such an exciting time. The power structure is being redefined, and we're redefining beauty with the stories that we're telling and the women we're showing on our covers.","There were times I was underestimated a lot. It gave me a unique benefit. The expectations were so low I could blow their head off.","I do think that the desire to permanently alter your body is triggered by this easy access to Photoshop on your phone.","It's only shocking to the uninitiated that 'Teen Vogue' would have the audacity to be political and style-focused.","If you feel that it diminishes your intelligence to be asked about your fashion choices for an evening on the red carpet, so be it.","I'm in a generation where MAC is the reigning brand for a lot of women - black, white, and other.","What I find is that when young people find a brand they relate to, that they feel speaks to them, they want it in every format they can get.","My mom used to call me 'Oprah' because I was always in a corner crying with somebody. I've always been attracted to storytelling around women's lives.","I honestly think our readers are gonna save the world.","Trump gets too much credit for 'Teen Vogue''s evolution.","As a young aspiring journalist, I felt I was put into a box.","Even with the beauty stories we put out, we saw there was an opportunity to address issues of representation, identity, self-expression. We created the community that we wanted to have at 'Teen Vogue.' We were willing to lose some to have more.","There's this moment happening in our culture where the power of the audience and the influence that people of color have is undeniable at this point.","The next generation of luxury consumers are much more socially conscious, and they look to invest in brands that see the world the way they do.","Particularly for back-to-school, braids are a great way of showcasing your personal style. It doesn't stop at your clothes; it extends to how you wear your hair.","I think braids over all allow you to play with your identity a little bit and just have some fun and show off your creativity.","I read everything, but particularly, growing up in a household where my mom was black and my dad was white, I remember really loving 'Ebony' and 'Essence.' Those magazines were the only place where I could see images of women who looked like me or my mom.","Finding a store that sells synthetic hair in Kigali is easier than locating a Starbucks in New York City without Google Maps.","It was so fun to see my hair all brushed out - it looked like caramel-flavored cotton candy!","I learned early on the magic of life is having a vision, having faith, and then going for it.","Nothing is as exciting - or as nerve-wracking - as being the new girl. Whether it's your first day of school or you're starting a dream job, if there's one thing that makes a first impression a lot less daunting, it's a really, really good hair day.","As a teen, every major moment was preempted by a torturous, hours-long hair-straightening session. Sleek, silky strands made me feel prettier. And the truth is, I was completely clueless about how to deal with my curls! When they weren't flatironed into submission for special occasions, they were practically glued down with gobs of gel.","Call me curl-crazed, but there's just something about a head full of waves that can command any room and make any outfit more interesting.","I've probably tried every curly-hair product on the planet!","As it's related to publishing, I think magazines really benefit from having a staff with a range of different perspectives and cultural references so that any reader can feel like there is someone on the masthead they can relate to, someone they can trust to speak up for them. It's great to see that idea being embraced more and more.","I had the chance to learn from some really talented people who have taught me a lot.","It's fun to sniff and slather on beauty products, but the end goal is finding what appeals most to 'Teen Vogue' readers and reporting on it in the most compelling way.","The life of an editor may seem all glam all the time, but there's nothing like schlepping through the city during a torrential downpour to put things in perspective.","Turns out moonlighting as a model is harder than I thought!","The thing about spending a lifetime under a long, bushy cloud of curls is that people naturally began associating me with my hair.","Any major hair change comes with unpredictable and often unfiltered reactions.","When 'Teen Vogue' started out, 'Teen Vogue' was an aspirational fashion magazine for fashion lovers. You know, it was the little sister to 'Vogue.' And over the years, we've realized that our mission was really to become more focused on making this an inclusive community that speaks to every kind of young person.","I think we speak to a certain mindset, and it's about, you know, inspiring people who are progressive thinkers who want to see change.","'Teen Vogue' is so much more than just a magazine. It's so much more than just a website. It's so much more than social. It's really about the audience, and so we're going to continue to innovate and continue to find new ways of reaching this audience in meaningful ways.","Beyonce's music is like lipstick or a decidedly tall pair of heels: It's empowering.","Bey's mantra isn't about putting on airs or makeup. For that matter, what makes Beyonce Beyonce is that thing we can all wake up with: confidence.","I think you've got to be able to relate to what teens are going through.","I joke that I've always had this sort of insatiable 'big sis' complex - which is odd given that I am the baby of the family with no sisters! It's the reason I have such a powerful desire to connect with girls and encourage them. So, it's a natural fit for me to have a job that's like the editorial version of an older sister to a million girls.","I truly believe that getting dressed in the morning is about deciding who you want to be, what you're saying in the world, and how you want people to see you. It's so much more than superficial.","I love so many different denim silhouettes, but I do love a denim onesie. I think you can't go wrong with a '70s-inspired, full-on head-to-toe denim moment. I also love high-waisted denim anything.","Practicing free speech on an open platform is a perilous path for any public figure, and there are no get-out-of-jail free passes in the court of public opinion.","There will always be a measure of calculated risk-taking in manufacturing fame, especially in a deeply divided political climate.","Besties Adwoa Aboah and Cara Delevingne have lot in common. They are both beautiful It Brits with impressive modeling chops - and matching half-heart tattoos that symbolize their unbreakable bond.","I started out as the assistant to the editor-in-chief at 'Ebony' magazine. She took me under her wing and gave me opportunities to take on bigger responsibilities very early on in my career.","Every boss I've ever had has challenged me, pushed me, believed in me, and led by example.","I always love stopping by to see what Marc Jacobs has. I will buy pieces from Bergdorf or Barneys and then hit up Zara or Topshop for the rest.","The beauty industry is changing every minute.","I stay current and draw inspiration from Fashion Week in New York as well as just by scrolling through Instagram. The runways are always a good sign of what's to come, but I also get tons of ideas from real girls on the street."],"Elana Meyers":["My favorite thing about South Korea is the people - they are so kind and helpful.","Find your passion, set a goal, go to work, evaluate, reassess, and repeat.","There's times when I'll be out in the middle of the track, standing in the curve, and I'll just laugh. 'What the heck am I doing right now? I'm sliding down the hill at crazy speeds and standing in freezing cold weather.'","In Sochi, I felt like I lost a gold.","Bobsledding is like sprinting with NASCAR. You get to push these 400-pound sleds as fast as you can down a hill and hop in. How could you not enjoy that?","I got a letter from a mom, and she was telling me about how her daughter is a tomboy and the trouble she has in classes and being around boys. She herself had the same kinds of problems growing up and how inspired they were by me. That was such an incredible email to receive.","The more eyeballs there are on the sport, it will get more diverse.","I want to represent my color and ethnicity. To be proud of our heritages is really cool.","I'm E Money because I'm money when it counts. Not sure exactly where or when it started, but I was called it in softball, too.","My dad was a Marine, my aunt is still in the Navy, and my grandfathers both served. So, it's a huge honor for me to represent my country in any way I can.","When bobsled is going right - and it sometimes goes wrong - it's the closest thing I could imagine to being a superhero.","All sports have a zone, but ours is at 95 mph. You can feel the speed; you can feel the wind. It's the most euphoric thing I've ever done.","Bobsled boils down to three things - your equipment, start, and drive. To win the Olympics requires all three.","I made driving mistakes in Sochi that cost me gold, and I'll torture myself for the rest of my life about that!","Being southern and doing bobsled was difficult from the standpoint that I had no idea how to handle the cold and how to dress in the cold, let alone warm up and compete in the cold - so it was a definite shock. I didn't even own a coat when I first started bobsledding!","I've always been the type willing to try a lot of different things.","I've been in plenty of crashes! Some are not too bad - resulting in ice burn. Others are pretty rough, and sometimes - rarely, but sometimes - people do get seriously injured. It's a risk we all know of and accept. If you bobsled, you're going to crash - guaranteed.","I'm not sure I'll ever love softball as much as bobsled. It's like having children: you don't love one more than the other, you just love them differently, and that's how my love for softball is vs. my love of bobsled - two totally different sports with different personalities.","After giving up softball, I didn't know what I was going to do. I thought I would try bobsled, but I wasn't really sure what would happen. I thought my athletic career was over.","I played all kinds of sports growing up: soccer, basketball, track. You name it, I've probably played it.","Bobsled is a universal sport, and most people don't know that. Anybody can slide down a hill.","I was a shortstop in softball, and a lot of times I had collisions with base runners coming in, so I definitely have scars.","Bobsleigh is best for athletes who are fast and strong, which were my strengths in softball.","Making the transition from softball to bobsleigh was difficult, but my family and friends believed in me when no one else would.","Anything worth having is worth working for.","After the situation I had with my concussion in 2015, how long and lasting the effects were, I'm just more careful about it.","Oh my gosh, cheat meals I could go on and on about.","I don't like cold weather.","Growing up, most girls have this image of how they want their wedding to be and things like that. I had none of that except for the cake I wanted, and that's what I got. The cake was the first thing we ordered.","I converted from softball. We've got volleyball, we've got track and field. Athletes come from anywhere and then convert into bobsled.","Most people watch a game because they're excited about it; I'll sit there and watch lacrosse championships to try to find a female who could be a bobsledder.","I'll do whatever I need to do to bring more athletes to the sport.","I don't put limits on anybody.","For most people, they only thing they know about bobsled is 'Cool Runnings.' Well, 'Cool Runnings' was, of course, four men in a bobsled, and four-man is considered the highlight of our sport. It's what everybody knows. It's what everybody watches. And it's the big dog of our sport.","I love this sport, and I want people to have the opportunities that I have. I want the kid in the inner city to know that she can be a bobsledder one day, and I want the kid in the middle of Africa to know that she can be a bobsledder one day. So the more that we can go out there and grow the sport, the better.","Anytime you hit a curve, or you hit on the side of the wall, you hit against the side of the sled. We're taking four to five, sometimes six or seven Gs on our body every time we go down the track. And then the crashing.","I went to college, George Washington University, and played softball there. I also played professionally but with the real goal of being an Olympian and making the Olympic team.","I'm a squat person: I love squats. I love back squats, things like that.","I've been on every type of nutrition plan you can think of.","If one little girl who looks like me picks up a winter sport because she sees me, that's all anybody could ever ask for.","I grew up in Douglasville, Georgia. My father played football for the Atlanta Falcons. We lived a bunch of places when I was younger. I was born in California. We lived in Chicago for a little bit, and finally, we ended up in Georgia.","I grew up playing softball, and at the age of nine, I decided I was going to be an Olympian. I didn't really know what that meant at the time. I thought it might be in a warm summer sport like softball, but I played a variety of sports growing up - basketball, soccer and track. I really didn't care. I just wanted to be an Olympian.","I played softball at George Washington University, and then I played professionally for the Mid-Michigan Ice. I had a couple of tryouts with the U.S. Olympic Team, but I don't know if I have a word to describe how bad one of the tryouts was. It was the worst tryout in the history of tryouts. It was that bad.","Being a brakeman is very physical, and success is mostly determined by how fast you can push a sled for about 30 meters.","I am powered by the defeat in Sochi, as I am by all my defeats.","It's important that the Olympics are motivating to young people and inspiring to all, and the only way to do that is to ensure clean performances, free of cheating.","I love who I am. But being a woman competing in a male-dominated sport and always trying to push the envelope as a female athlete, you get a lot of comparisons to men and things like that.","I've encountered a lot of biases as a woman.","My mom has never cared if I did sports or not. Obviously, she's proud of me, and she loves the fact that I'm an Olympian and she's got these trinkets to hang around with the medals and whatnot. But if I wanted to do whatever, if I wanted to be a doctor or a lawyer or whatever, she was going to support me regardless.","We train six days a week, and each day includes some type of running or strength workout. It's all about getting functionally stronger in the positions that matter for racing, which means balancing the strength between my quads and hamstrings.","I'm not big on protein shakes - I think they're pretty gross, actually - so I have to make sure I eat enough meat, fish, and other good protein sources.","You could have the best run of your life and lose a race because somebody has a better day. Or you could have the worst run and win.","Bobsledding is an expensive sport.","Bobsledders are big athletes, and I'm a big athlete.","My dad was a football player, and I've been the same size since eighth grade, so I get how it can be hard when you don't fit in with the 'normal-size' girls, or your butt and legs are too big for normal-size jeans.","People win medals in all shapes and sizes! And I can't help but say that finding a fiance who loves me unconditionally at any size has played a huge role in my body confidence.","I really, really wanted to be an Olympian. My parents knew about this dream of mine, and they suggested I try my hand at bobsled. They'd seen it on TV at the Salt Lake City Games in 2002 and thought it would be a good sport for me.","Bobsled is best for athletes who are fast and strong, which were my strengths in softball.","If you've seen 'Cool Runnings,' it looks pretty easy. You're just riding in a sled, right? Not exactly. Bobsled actually involves a series of complex movements that aren't like those in any other sport. You put your body into a really awkward position to push a 400-pound sled downhill on ice.","In bobsled, you work as a team - a driver and a brakeman. Both athletes push, but the brakeman's biggest responsibility is to push as fast as she can and get in and ride down in a good aerodynamic position. The driver helps to push but gets in first and then steers the sled down the track. We aren't just along for the ride, despite how it looks!","Traditionally, the treatment for a concussion has been to stare at a wall and wait for your brain to heal itself. Don't watch TV, don't read a book, don't look at your phone, and definitely don't train. It's a torturous protocol for an athlete.","It's hard to describe what it's like to live with a concussion. You want to enjoy things like you used to, but you can't. You wake up in the morning and wonder how you're going to feel that day: What will my reactions be like? Will I have a headache? Will I have to triple check to see if I unplugged the flat iron?","All growing up, the outside world wants to tell you what you can and cannot do as a female - what sports are acceptable, what sports are appropriate, what is appropriate to study, what is appropriate to say. But luckily, I have a strong family, and my mom is the most amazing mom in the world. She never let me worry about biases.","I was always encouraged to participate in whatever sports I wanted to be in.","I know how much my mom has impacted my journey and how much I wouldn't be where I am without my mom. As much as she says she's proud of me, I'm even more so proud of her because of what she's done and how she's been able to raise me and my sisters.","The biggest thing for me is keeping my hair moisturized. My go-tos are the Pantene Gold Series Hydrating Butter Cream and Intense Hydrating Oil.","I'm freakishly good at squatting.","I trash talk all the time.","For me, it's always been about continually challenging myself and continually figuring out how to go down the hill faster.","A guy like Usain Bolt would be sick behind a bobsled.","I love my teammates. I love my coaches.","I feel like sport can transcend a lot of different things.","Sport can transcend bias.","Love can overcome everything.","I train with track athletes, which is weird for bobsledders. I love training with track athletes because they help me work on my speed, and they give me something to cheer for during the Summer Olympics.","Biggest rival is Kaillie Humphries of Canada, and we are actually training partners. She was at my wedding, and I consider her a close friend.","Whether you think you can or you can't, you're right. Just shows you how powerful beliefs are and how you have the ability to change your situation and affect what happens to you. The mind is a powerful thing.","I've got some genetic gifts.","I'm a representative of something that's greater than myself. I'm not just representing myself or my country: I'm representing Christ and what He's done through me.","My father was an NFL running back, so I feel like I might be more susceptible, genetically, to CTE.","Even though concussions affect women more often than men, there's not a lot of concussion research about women specifically. You can slip and fall and hit your head and have a concussion. And unless you know what to do, and unless you're able to take the right steps, you may not be able to recover.","I love this country. I love being a citizen. I believe we are the greatest country in the world.","There is a stigma in our sport that men are the better drivers. People think that, because the men compete in two-man and four-man, they are more versatile and that the women aren't great drivers.","The Midland community is huge into softball. They have a lot of competitive men's teams. We played at a beautiful stadium, and our games would be packed every weekend. I'm pretty sure people have my signature on softballs and they don't even know. Because we would just sign so many autographs all of the time.","Regardless of what you look like, regardless of where you come from, you can be involved in winter sports.","I love driving the sled more than anything.","The things I've had to overcome have been crazy.","I think the hardest thing is that all of us would love to just stick to sports - but if you want us to be role models to kids, then you need to stand for more than just sports.","The Lord calls us to love everybody.","It's a challenge, but every single German or Canadian I want to beat, I still have to love them. That means competing the way God wants me to compete and helping my opponents if they have a need.","My father's NFL dreams never really felt like motivation to me, but it was something to aspire to. He was such a great athlete, the least I could do is try and use my athletic talent to represent my country in a different way. He represented as a Marine. Maybe I could do something to represent as an athlete.","Having my dad play for the Falcons, what it did was really to expose me to a whole bunch of other elite-level athletes, which I think gives me an advantage and allowed me to understand what goes into sports. It is more than going out onto the field and going out onto the ice and competing.","If I'm honest, the thing I remember the most was the team mascot, Freddie the Falcon. I really remember there was a McDonald's nearby, and I remember eating a cheeseburger in the playground when the Falcon appeared. I'm not sure my dad appreciates that being my favorite memory of him playing.","Our sport is one of the few on the winter side that is so diverse. It shows we don't have to be limited by race or gender or whatever and how far we have come as a sport.","Being a minority athlete in this sport, it's been wrought with challenges, but I wouldn't consider myself a trail blazer.","We're a sport that was in obscurity for so long, we started to get used to that.","You get this feeling in bobsled, like a combination of excitement, anxiety, and pure nervousness, and you get that combination only very few times.","People say a two-man sled is like driving a racecar, and a four-man is like driving a truck. And it feels that way.","The first run in a four-man sled was one of the most nerve-wracking I've had in my life."],"Elayne Boosler":["I am thankful the most important key in history was invented. It's not the key to your house, your car, your boat, your safety deposit box, your bike lock or your private community. It's the key to order, sanity, and peace of mind. The key is 'Delete.'","We have wild animals in zoos, yet people rarely meet their 'food' face to face.","Designers don't put out the same sweater every year. They just keep creating.","My ancestors wandered lost in the wilderness for forty years because even in biblical times, men would not stop to ask for directions.","You know, if you need 100 rounds to kill a deer, maybe hunting isn't your sport.","Horse racing is waning in popularity.","My belief is that guns are too easy to get in America. My belief is that the NRA has bought much of our congress, to the point that guns are actually the only unregulated consumer product in America. Think about that.

The sincerity, the youth involvement, the desire for better, is palpable and moving.

Anthony's, Roosevelts, Hamiltons, a Sacajawea or two, and an Abe Lincoln to cover Scalia in full.","I have six locks on my door all in a row. When I go out, I lock every other one. I figure no matter how long somebody stands there picking the locks, they are always locking three.","Ever notice that Soup for One is eight aisles away from Party Mix?","You never see a man walking down the street with a woman who has a little potbelly and a bald spot.","My breakup with AT&T is final, and I'm done with Skype as the rebound guy.","When I played the Sahara Hotel in Las Vegas on New Year's Eve, I got to bring Wiley, my 85-pound black lab. He's responsible for my favorite New Year's memory of all: At the end of the show, he ran onstage and then out across all the tables in the showroom, sending champagne glasses and gamblers flying.","Wouldn't it be great if you could only get AIDS by giving money to television preachers?","I've never been married, but I tell people I'm divorced so they won't think something is wrong with me.","When the sun comes up, I have morals again.","When women are depressed, they eat or go shopping. Men invade another country. It's a whole different way of thinking.","I'm just a person trapped inside a woman's body.","To listen to your own silence is the key to comedy.","Stand-up is like a movie every night. You write it, direct it, produce it, the audience votes, and you go home. There's nothing more satisfying.","I know what men want. Men want to be really, really close to someone who will leave them alone.","I've thought for the last decade or so, the only actual place raw truth was seeping through in newspapers was on the Comics Pages. They were able to pull off intelligent social comment, pure truths not found elsewhere in the news pages, and had the ability to make it all funny, entertaining, and pertinent.","A study last year showed that the page you turn to first in the newspaper can be a predictor of how long you will live. No surprise, turning first to the Comics Pages prolongs your life.","I am thankful that geniuses and artists and good people, no matter how hard it is, will eventually be recognized. I am doubly thankful that also goes for idiots.","I am thankful I was born in America, although if I gain any more weight the burqa thing may start to seem like a good idea to me. See? Another plus about America, you can always find some food.","Guys wake up at your place and they expect breakfast. They don't eat bagels and M&M's in the morning. They want things like toast. I say, 'I don't have these recipes.'","When I was growing up in comedy, there were maybe 10 comics in the whole country. Everyone had a day job. You worked free for years in little clubs, then you got your big break and became a star.","I've never been able to write for stand-up.","I can't get married. I can't fake sleep for 30 years.","I deliver very traditionally, and people aren't threatened. I think if I cursed or seemed wilder, I couldn't get away with the amount of very opinionated politics I get away with.","I run everywhere and eavesdrop. It's the best way to see a city.","My family was totally non-religious. There was no question we were Jewish, but we were not observant.","I always had a running commentary in my head that was extremely funny and off-center, but I never said it to anyone.","San Francisco is really fun and liberal, and it's my kind of politics. It's like being Jewish in front of Jewish people.","I'm pretty equal opportunity when it comes to issues to joke about.","I'd much rather see Richard Pryor or Jackie Mason in a theater than in a club.","I like to go after the foibles, basically of beliefs that are held without question. If people still want to believe in their stuff after that, that's great - as long as they just have a chance to step back and look at it for a second. Sometimes, you don't even realize what you've been thinking for 20 years.","For me, comedy is a day-to-day report on the human condition. It's what's happening right now. I get maybe 20 minutes of my act straight from the newspaper.","It doesn't bother me that I'm not a household word on the East Coast. Baton Rouge, Raleigh, Minneapolis - I'm so popular in these cities where you've never imagined an East Coast comedian working.","There are many comedians who are afraid to work outside the coasts and the casinos because they're afraid they'll bomb.","I think about death. I don't want to die with clothes in the cleaners.","I don't categorize myself. I don't think I'm perceived as a female act by my audience. My fans include just as many men as women.","I wasn't funny as a kid. I remember enjoying comedians, but I never understood it was a job choice or a profession.","I just get the feeling that if Jesse Helms was in charge of art in America, you'd go into a museum and see nothing but prints of dogs playing cards.","I pray if I ever find out I have only about three minutes to live it's during a basketball game, because then I'll have, what, 10, 12 years to live?","I guess in general, people tend to not eat the cute animals.","My fashion philosophy is, if you're not covered in dog hair, your life is empty.","I am thankful that all the people in the world who absolutely, positively, know what God wants, usually kill mostly each other.","I personally cannot tell you how many times we rescuers put our names on animals to come to us as soon as they are eligible for release, only to find they have been senselessly killed by overzealous pound workers.","I have no complaints about losing money I put in high-risk investments. I did some of that when I had real money; my informed choice, my measured gamble.","Here is what is needed for Occupy Wall Street to become a force for change: a clear, and clearly expressed, objective. Or two.","Sometimes, if you really don't know how you feel about a topic, reading how both sides argue it can help.","While editors and newspaper owners currently fret over shrinking readership and lost profits, they do the one thing that insures cutting their own throats; they keep reducing space for the one feature that attracts new young readers in the first place; the comic strips.","We've seen the uproars around the world concerning cartoons depicting the prophet Mohammad. Anyone who does not think comic strips are relevant never had a fatwa put on him/her for drawing a picture.","Why isn't the movie industry forced to open its shooting locations to an organization that is there to advocate for animal actors? The industry isn't allowed to pick and choose which movies using young children it will or won't allow to be monitored. The vulnerable should be protected.","Wouldn't it be great to see a line in all movie credits that truthfully says, 'Nobody was harmed in the making of this film, and at the cast party, all animals got a belly belly belly rub.'","As a standup comedian, I've worked almost every New Year's Eve of my adult life. It's the best-paying night of the year.","Calgary wins for my coldest New Year's Eve gig. That's when I learned Fahrenheit and Celsius cross at 40 below. I could see callers' breath coming out of my phone.","Incredibly, almost every hotel I ever played in Vegas was blown up shortly afterward: The Dunes, The Sands, The Landmark, The Aladdin, The Frontier, The Hacienda, The Stardust - all were imploded.","I have always put my own money into Tails of Joy. For years, every time a dog walked by, my husband would say, 'There goes our beach house.'","I never minded flying cheap. I always said to myself, 'Taking this flight saves enough money to rescue four dogs, or six cats, or will let me make a difference to the one woman saving chimps in Cameroon.'"],"Elbert Hubbard":["Do not take life too seriously. You will never get out of it alive.","He who does not understand your silence will probably not understand your words.","The best preparation for good work tomorrow is to do good work today.","The supernatural is the natural not yet understood.","Do your work with your whole heart, and you will succeed - there's so little competition.","Positive anything is better than negative nothing.","Be pleasant until ten o'clock in the morning and the rest of the day will take care of itself.","God will not look you over for medals degrees or diplomas, but for scars.","Never explain - your friends do not need it and your enemies will not believe you anyway.","A little more persistence, a little more effort, and what seemed hopeless failure may turn to glorious success.","Know what you want to do, hold the thought firmly, and do every day what should be done, and every sunset will see you that much nearer to your goal.","To avoid criticism, do nothing, say nothing, and be nothing.","If you suffer, thank God!

The love we give away is the only love we keep. The only way to retain love is to give it away.","The object of teaching a child is to enable him to get along without his teacher.","The recipe for perpetual ignorance is: Be satisfied with your opinions and content with your knowledge.","The love we give away is the only love we keep.","Art is not a thing; it is a way.","The only foes that threaten America are the enemies at home, and these are ignorance, superstition and incompetence.","Every man is a damn fool for at least five minutes every day; wisdom consists in not exceeding the limit.","A man is not paid for having a head and hands, but for using them.","Fear clogs; faith liberates.","He has achieved success who has worked well, laughed often, and loved much.","One machine can do the work of fifty ordinary men. No machine can do the work of one extraordinary man.","We are punished by our sins, not for them.","We work to become, not to acquire.","Little minds are interested in the extraordinary; great minds in the commonplace.","Responsibility is the price of freedom.","A woman will doubt everything you say except it be compliments to herself.","Life in abundance comes only through great love.","Editor: a person employed by a newspaper, whose business it is to separate the wheat from the chaff, and to see that the chaff is printed.","There is no failure except in no longer trying.","Polygamy: An endeavour to get more out of life than there is in it.","How many a man has thrown up his hands at a time when a little more effort, a little more patience would have achieved success.","Christianity supplies a Hell for the people who disagree with you and a Heaven for your friends.","We are not punished for our sins, but by them.","A conservative is a man who is too cowardly to fight and too fat to run.","The world is moving so fast these days that the man who says it can't be done is generally interrupted by someone doing it.","Our desires always disappoint us; for though we meet with something that gives us satisfaction, yet it never thoroughly answers our expectation.","It does not take much strength to do things, but it requires great strength to decide on what to do.","If pleasures are greatest in anticipation, just remember that this is also true of trouble.","A failure is a man who has blundered, but is not able to cash in the experience.","A pessimist?

It is the ability to recognize ability.","Art is the beautiful way of doing things. Science is the effective way of doing things. Business is the economic way of doing things.","The ineffable joy of forgiving and being forgiven forms an ecstasy that might well arouse the envy of the gods.","Die, v.: To stop sinning suddenly.","If you can't answer a man's arguments, all is not lost; you can still call him vile names.","Where much is expected from an individual, he may rise to the level of events and make the dream come true.","The reason men oppose progress is not that they hate progress, but that they love inertia.","No one ever gets far unless he accomplishes the impossible at least once a day.","Men are only as great as they are kind.","Love, we say, is life; but love without hope and faith is agonizing death.","Every tyrant who has lived has believed in freedom for himself.","It is easy to get everything you want, provided you first learn to do without the things you cannot get.","Many a man's reputation would not know his character if they met on the street.","Optimism is a kind of heart stimulant - the digitalis of failure.","An idea that is not dangerous is not worthy of being called an idea at all.","It may happen sometimes that a long debate becomes the cause of a longer friendship. Commonly, those who dispute with one another at last agree.","It's pretty hard to be efficient without being obnoxious.","I would rather be able to appreciate things I can not have than to have things I am not able to appreciate.","The idea that is not dangerous is not worthy of being called an idea at all.","Often we can help each other most by leaving each other alone; at other times we need the hand-grasp and the word of cheer.","So long as governments set the example of killing their enemies, private individuals will occasionally kill theirs.","A man is as good as he has to be, and a woman as bad as she dares.","The church saves sinners, but science seeks to stop their manufacture.","Reversing your treatment of the man you have wronged is better than asking his forgiveness.","The line between failure and success is so fine that we scarcely know when we pass it: so fine that we are often on the line and do not know it.","In order to have friends, you must first be one.","Fear is the thought of admitted inferiority.","The thing we fear we bring to pass.","Friendship, like credit, is highest when it is not used.","The happiness of this life depends less on what befalls you than the way in which you take it.","The man who knows it can't be done counts the risk, not the reward."],"Elden Henson":["I'm great at fake typing but in real life terrible.","I've always wanted to meet Robert Downey, Jr. because I think he's awesome.","You never want me in a position to have to think.

They brought me so much joy.","If you meet someone on the street that likes something that you did or likes the way you brought this character to life, that's really rewarding. That's really cool.","I know of the Daredevil comic because it's so iconic.","I've been acting a long time. I've been a member of SAG since 1982.","I love the Avengers movies and Iron Man and Captain America.","As an actor, I'm always just so pumped when I get any job. To be a working actor takes a lot of luck.","I'm a movie nerd, and when I'm really looking forward to something coming out, the less I know, the better."],"Eldridge Cleaver":["You're either part of the solution or you're part of the problem.","Too much agreement kills a chat.","I feel that I am a citizen of the American dream and that the revolutionary struggle of which I am a part is a struggle against the American nightmare.","You don't have to teach people how to be human. You have to teach them how to stop being inhuman.","If a man like Malcolm X could change and repudiate racism, if I myself and other former Muslims can change, if young whites can change, then there is hope for America.","I have taken an oath in my heart to oppose communism until the day I die.","The Twist was a guided missile launched from the ghetto into the heart of suburbia. The Twist succeeded, as politics, religion and law could never do, in writing in the heart and soul what the Supreme Court could only write on the books.","There is no calamity which a great nation can invite which equals that which follows a supine submission to wrong and injustice and the consequent loss of national self-respect and honor, beneath which are shielded and defended a people's safety and greatness.","Respect commands itself and can neither be given nor withheld when it is due.","The price of hating other human beings is loving oneself less.","All the gods are dead except the god of war.","In prison, those things withheld from and denied to the prisoner become precisely what he wants most of all.","History could pass for a scarlet text, its jot and title graven red in human blood.","What America demands in her black champions is a brilliant, powerful body and a dull, bestial mind.","Everybody changes, not just me.","I've gone beyond civil rights and human rights to creation rights."],"Eleanor Catton":["To experience sublime natural beauty is to confront the total inadequacy of language to describe what you see. Words cannot convey the scale of a view that is so stunning it is felt.","A trip to the picture framer's, with a selection of prints, is the most joyous outing I can imagine. I've spent more money on framing than on anything else I own.","I think that, in principle, a workshop is such a beautiful idea - an environment in which writers who are collectively apprenticed to the craft of writing can come together in order to collectively improve.","Astrology's a moving system that depends on where you're looking at it from on Earth. My horoscope here in London would be completely different to down in New Zealand.","The zodiac is a system a person can play with and see meaning in.","Fiction is supposed to be immersive and supposed to be entertaining and narrative, so structures have to be buried a little bit. If they come foregrounded too much, it stops being fiction and starts being poetry - something more concrete and out of time.","My father is an expatriate American; he fell in love with New Zealand in his youth and never went home.","The ability of humans to read meaning into patterns is the most defining characteristic we have.","I think that's what fiction writing is actually all about. It's about trying to solve problems in creative ways.","It is less fun to talk about what I am feeling rather than what I am thinking. Saying 'I feel awesome' isn't really interesting or enquiring.","We throw at female artists this expectation that their work has to speak to the female experience. And if it doesn't, you're letting the side down. Throwing this stumbling block in the way of female artists is counterintuitive.","In my experience, and that of a lot of other women writers, all of the questions coming at them from interviewers tend to be about how lucky they are to be where they are - about luck and identity and how the idea struck them.","I don't see that my age has anything to do with what is between the covers of my book, any more than the fact that I am right-handed. It's a fact of my biography, but it's uninteresting.","There was a computer in our garage when I was growing up, and I'd go out there in winter and wrap myself in a blanket and write a story.","I feel very strongly influenced by long-form box-set TV drama... I feel really excited that, at last, the novel has found its on-screen equivalent, because the emotional arcs and changes that you can follow are just so much more like a novel, and so many amazing shows recently have done as much as film can do to show the interior world.","I really wanted to write an adventure story, a murder-mystery that was set during the gold-rush years in New Zealand.","The way that I see astrology is as a repository of thought and psychology. A system we've created as a culture as way to make things mean things.","As an artist, you need to be not at all entitled in your relation with the work. So money is kind of worrying. You can start to expect things if you're used to a certain level of comfort.","Money doesn't transform a person - the only thing that can is love.","I have always loved reading books for children and young adults, particularly when those books are mysteries.","From the very beginning, I had an ambition for 'The Luminaries': a direction - but not a real idea.","I highlight everything I find interesting, and then type out everything I've highlighted, and then print out everything I've typed, and reread these printed notes as often as possible.","The nice thing about the zodiac as a system is it is quite comprehensive as a range of impulses and psychological states it can speak about.","I often feel intellectually frustrated when I'm in a position where I'm not moving forward; when I'm not enquiring about something.","One of the things I really like about Victorian novels is the close anatomisation of character. People's gestures and mannerisms and the quality of their thought is very closely identified and analysed.","The readership of Victorian novels, when they were published, was much less diverse. People were probably white, and had enough money to be literate. Very often, there are phrases in Italian, German and French that are left untranslated.","Any description of a person that comes from the outside is very hard to deal with. People don't like being summarised. It's nice to receive a compliment, but it makes me feel a bit uncomfortable.","An interesting thing about New Zealand, you know, literature is that it really didn't begin in any real sense until the 20th century.","The challenge that I set for myself was to see whether or not plot and structure could coexist, and why it was that we had to always privilege one above the other.","There are a lot of people of my generation in New Zealand literature, young writers on their first or second books, that I'm just really excited about. There seems to be a big gap between the generation above and us; it seems to be quite radically different in terms of form and approach.","I think that writers of literary fiction would do well to read more books for children.","The books that really made an impact on me were not set in New Zealand. Some were New Zealand novels, but the New Zealandness of them was not what carried me or excited me.","There are so many ways of posturing that people associate with being a writer. They imagine you wearing a beret and drinking only red wine and being full of yourself, and so, for a long time, the way I felt about writing was too private. I felt it too important and didn't want to be teased about it. So I lied about it.","I much prefer a plotted novel to a novel that is really conceptual.","I had never read Victorian novels before going overseas. I read a handful of authors, but I had not immersed myself in the literature of the 19th century.","I can feel the public side of my life and the private side of my life sort of drifting away from one another.","It's very brave going from a position of authority to one where you are an apprentice.","You can tell when a writer moves out of a place of struggle and into a place of comfort, and it's always a bad thing.","Is the prestige conferred by the Man Booker prize for the book or me? I would prefer it on the book and for me to be treated ordinarily.","Teaching is a great complement to writing. It's very social and gets you out of your own head. It's also very optimistic. It renews itself every year - it's a renewable resource.","I am a New Zealander, but I don't want to swallow New Zealand identity in one gulp.","Writing is exhilarating, but reading reviews is not. I've been really devastated by 'good' reviews because they misunderstand the project of the book. It can be strangely galvanising to get a 'bad' one.","What I wanted to create with 'The Luminaries' is a book that had structural patterns built in that didn't matter, but if you cared about them, you could look into the book and see them.","It seems pretentious to assume that we are not creatures of action. I think often it takes a situation of extreme absurdity, extreme action, to push us to the limits of what our character is, and to change us as people.","I think it's more optimistic about human nature to acknowledge that people are the products of their time but then to see that they have moments of grace and dignity that everybody has.","I grew up on the South Island of New Zealand, in a city chosen and beloved by my parents for its proximity to the mountains - Christchurch is two hours distant from the worn saddle of Arthur's Pass, the mountain village that was and is my father's spiritual touchstone, his chapel and cathedral in the wild.","My sense of injustice about our family's 'weirdness' in not owning a car was amplified by the fact that we did not own a television, either - my parents were unapologetic about this and told me very cheerfully that I would thank them for it when I was older, which was quite true.","Sometimes I'll read something on Twitter, and I'll just be in the darkest of moods for the rest of the day or the rest of the week sometimes.","I've had countless reviews sort that have made me cry. It's funny, it doesn't ever get better either; you can't turn your ears off.","'The Luminaries' is such a different book to 'The Rehearsal.' There are only a couple of things that link the two books: there's a certain preoccupation with looking at relationships from the outside, being shut out of human intimacy; and then there's patterning.","I loved 'Middlemarch,' I think that's one of my favourite books of all time, actually.","Long historical books get written by women, but not contemporary experiments, which still seems to be a very male-dominated field.","I don't feel like literature has the power to alienate. I think that's something people feel if they don't connect with a work of art. But I don't think a work of art can actively reject the person who's looking at it or reading it.","My second novel, 'The Luminaries,' is set in the New Zealand gold rushes of the 1860s, though it's not really a historical novel in the conventional sense. So far, I've been describing it as 'an astrological murder mystery.'","I'm a Libra. I'm happy to be an air sign, but I do think I have a little too much air in my chart as a whole - some more water would be useful, especially in my personal life, as an emotional counterweight to all that abstraction.","I think the adverb is a much-maligned part of speech. It's always accused of being oppressive, even tyrannical, when in fact it's so supple and sly.","My parents took me to the Bronte parsonage in England when I was a teenager. I had a fight with my mum, burst into tears, jumped over a stile and ran out into the moors. It felt very authentic: A moor really is an excellent place to have a temper tantrum.","I went to a state school in Christchurch, New Zealand, and then straight on to the University of Canterbury. But I worked part-time all the way through high school: first with a paper round, then at a fast-food outlet, a video store and a hardware store.","I vote far-left. I am frequently angered by corporate greed and think education ought to be free and teachers paid well.","I see disappointment as something small and aggregate rather than something unified or great. With a little effort, every failure can be turned into something good.","In researching 'The Luminaries,' I did read quite a lot of 20th-century crime. My favourites out of that were James M. Cain, Dassiell Hammett, Raymond Chandler and Graham Greene and Patricia Highsmith.","Margaret Atwood was the author who took me out of children's literature and guided me towards adult literature.","I think that you have to keep the reader front and centre if you're going to write something that people are going to love and be entertained by.","What I feel is that true creation happens when you're making something out of nothing - like it's divine, you know. Creation is a completely divine concept.","I would draw a really sharp distinction between creating and producing. I think that they're very different things.","I have written ever since I knew mechanically how to do it.","I believe really strongly in imitation, actually: I think it's the first place you need to go to if you're going to be able to understand how something works. True mimicry is actually quite difficult.","When I was writing 'The Luminaries,' I read a lot of crime novels because I wanted to figure out which ones made me go, 'Ah! I didn't know that was coming!'","My mum was a children's librarian, so I spent a lot of time in the library. My reading life, because of my mum's work, was evenly split between American, Canadian, Australian and British authors.","In improvising, you've got your scale; you've got the notes that are going to sound good with other notes, the intervals that are going to sound good. But you've also got all the chromatic possibilities, the possibilities of sounding dissident, of being unexpected.","Often I listen to songs on repeat for days and days at a time. There's something hypnotic or meditative, and it mirrors the way that I am putting the sentence together, going back over the same phrases again and again.","I'm the rogue Canadian in my family - I just happened to be born here while my parents were studying here."],"Eleanor Clift":["If you think of life and death on a continuum, finding the point where it tips is complicated. It cuts across all political lines and gets to the root of our humanity. It requires faith informed by years of intimacy that you're doing what's right for your loved one.","Politics is so much about serendipity that we've got to have a bigger pool of women, so that when people drop out of the process, you've got others to turn to.","At the unveiling at the White House of the presidential portrait, President Bush pointed out that Hillary Clinton was the first sitting Senator in history to have her portrait hanging in the White House.","If privacy ends where hypocrisy begins, Kitty Kelley's steamy expose is a contribution to contemporary history.","If you look at where presidents come from, they're former governors or senators.","It's a complicated set of opinions that women bring to the voting booth.","Living in the fishbowl is hard enough without worrying about a Secret Service that can't keep mum.","Looking at female candidates today, other women are the hardest on them, especially older women who were brought up in a different culture.","Often, the disparities in the ways men and women are treated are subtle; there are not these clear barriers that you have to break down.","People want change but not too much change. Finding that balance is tricky for every politician.","The list of women to potentially be on a major party ticket, in both parties, is embarrassingly short.","Today's young women don't really see inequities until they go out into the real world.","You get elected, often, if you're a woman, on the strength of the women's vote; then you get into office, and you have to adapt to an overwhelmingly male environment.","Bush is good at stating the obviously untrue.","If there is a ground zero in the cultural wars, it is Missouri, a state where pro-life groups are strong and well organized and their agenda dominates local politics.","Hospice means end-of-life care. The admission ticket is a diagnosis from a doctor that you have six months or less to live.","Bush does not want to go down in history as the president who lost in Iraq. His strategy to the extent he has one is to hang tough and let whoever succeeds him take the fall."],"Eleanor Holmes Norton":["As commissioner, I will attempt to see that no man is judged by the irrational criteria of race, religion, or national origin. And I assure you, I use the word 'man' in the generic sense, for I mean to see that the principle of nondiscrimination becomes a reality for women as well.","Affirmative action is the most important antidiscrimination technique ever instituted in the United States. It is the one tool that has had a demonstrable effect on discrimination... Affirmative action, by all statistical measures, has been the central ingredient to the creation of the black middle class.","There are not many males, black or white, who wish to get involved with a woman who's committed to her own development.","I don't for a moment believe that women have suffered the same kind of injustices that blacks have - women have never been enslaved. But still, many of the psychological and economic problems are the same.","My generation took on political equality. I believe young people, who have graduated into a poor economy, have an incentive to take on much tougher issues of income equality. If they show the leadership they have demonstrated in the last few elections, they can bring changes even greater than my generation achieved.","On the road to equality there is no better place for blacks to detour around American values than in forgoing its example in the treatment of its women and the organization of its family.","There is no reason to repeat bad history.","Men without jobs do not form families.","With children no longer the universally accepted reason for marriage, marriages are going to have to exist on their own merits.","If diversity is what is a central value in every selective university in the United States, then it ought to be seen as a compelling interest by the Supreme Court.","That line, about half of somebody's supporters being deplorables, was maybe the worst line I've ever heard in politics. You never - even when you're running against a bunch of racists, you never take off against the voters. It was a politics 101 foible.","The broad brush of stereotyping is what least appeals to people of color.","I am not among those who engage in nostalgia, because I think that locks you into a moment in time without thinking about where you are, what needs to be done now.","I agree that income disparity is the great issue of our time. It is even broader and more difficult than the civil rights issues of the 1960s. The '99 percent' is not just a slogan. The disparity in income has left the middle class with lowered, not rising, income, and the poor unable to reach the middle class.","I went to Dunbar High School, recognized as the best high school of the segregated era. The education enabled students from Dunbar to attend the best colleges and universities in the country.","I am proud to be an American, proud to represent 600,000 Americans, and proud to be in the only party pledged to make the District of Columbia the 51st state.","We understand that in an open and democratic and free society, you cannot make yourself impenetrable, especially when there are more guns than there are people in the United States today."],"Eleanor Mondale":["The biggest hurdle is figuring out who your friends are. Your real friends.","Actually, I'm 130, but 125 is what I put on my resume, because that's what I look like I weigh.","I'd like to be the ambassador to the Bahamas.","We're Norwegians. You know, the Vikings. My deadlift was 310 pounds. I mean, I was very, very strong - and I didn't take steroids. I did it all on my own.","I have more self-confidence than I did when I was in my 20s.","How rude would I be, walking around and saying: 'Hello. I'm Eleanor Mondale. My father was vice president of the United States. Treat me differently.'","Don't forget to vote for Bill Clinton and Al Gore. Stay home if you're voting for Dole.","I have to prove myself five times over.","I like to get wild.","I didn't like not having work and not having people return my calls.","There was a point when I almost gave up. I couldn't feed myself. I couldn't feed my pets.","I wanted to be an actress. I think it had a lot to do with being a kid and watching how every time my dad would stand up to talk people would applaud... that was pretty cool.","I started out pursuing an acting career out of college when I lived in Los Angeles. When I got an entry into broadcasting, I preferred it. I liked being me, rather than dressing up to be someone else. Now I'm 30 and doing a career of my own and have been in this career for eight years.","The reporting I did was mostly entertainment or lifestyle. I took a very different approach than most reporters. I approached it more casually than you would think a reporter would. Now I'm a morning radio personality, and radio is really casual.","I like being involved in the lighter side of journalism because it serves a purpose, and it's fun. And I can keep my opinions off camera if I want.","I didn't want to get married. What I knew of most men was something I didn't want any part of. I just wanted to work on my career.","I make bad choices. I've got such dodgy tastes in men.","When you're nearing 35, going, 'Hey Dad, I can't make these payments,' just isn't cool.","I like fashion. I like being in shape. I like to look nice and I like to make money, but I don't think that's the most, No. 1, important thing.","I've always considered myself a physical person. I don't call myself a farm girl, but I did spend a lot of years shoveling manure and throwing hay, because I worked to pay most of my riding expenses.","My parents are always supportive of anything their kids do. They point out the pros and cons, but they let you make your own decisions, and when it's bad they stick by you."],"Eleanor Parker":["When I am spotted somewhere, it means that my characterizations haven't covered up Eleanor Parker the person. I prefer it the other way around.","I'm primarily a character actress.","I've portrayed so many diverse individuals on the screen that my own personality never emerged."],"Eleanor Porter":["My relationship with 'Pollyanna' is a very personal one, because Pollyanna got me through my childhood.","One day it was about getting married that mother talked with me, and I said I was so glad that when you didn't like being married, or got tired of your husband, you could get Unmarried."],"Eleanor Robson Belmont":["A private railroad car is not an acquired taste. One takes to it immediately.","Never be afraid to meet to the hilt the demand of either work, or friendship - two of life's major assets."],"Eleanor Roosevelt":["With the new day comes new strength and new thoughts.","The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.","A woman is like a tea bag - you can't tell how strong she is until you put her in hot water.","You gain strength, courage, and confidence by every experience in which you really stop to look fear in the face. You are able to say to yourself, 'I lived through this horror. I can take the next thing that comes along.'","Great minds discuss ideas; average minds discuss events; small minds discuss people.","We are afraid to care too much, for fear that the other person does not care at all.","You must do the things you think you cannot do.","No one can make you feel inferior without your consent.","Justice cannot be for one side alone, but must be for both.","Understanding is a two-way street.","In the long run, we shape our lives, and we shape ourselves. The process never ends until we die. And the choices we make are ultimately our own responsibility.","You have to accept whatever comes and the only important thing is that you meet it with courage and with the best that you have to give.","It is not more vacation we need - it is more vocation.","Probably the happiest period in life most frequently is in middle age, when the eager passions of youth are cooled, and the infirmities of age not yet begun; as we see that the shadows, which are at morning and evening so large, almost entirely disappear at midday.","One's philosophy is not best expressed in words; it is expressed in the choices one makes... and the choices we make are ultimately our responsibility.","The giving of love is an education in itself.","When you cease to make a contribution, you begin to die.","It is not fair to ask of others what you are not willing to do yourself.","Happiness is not a goal; it is a by-product.","Do what you feel in your heart to be right- for you'll be criticized anyway. You'll be damned if you do, and damned if you don't.","People grow through experience if they meet life honestly and courageously. This is how character is built.","Never allow a person to tell you no who doesn't have the power to say yes.","If life were predictable it would cease to be life, and be without flavor.","Perhaps nature is our best assurance of immortality.","I think, at a child's birth, if a mother could ask a fairy godmother to endow it with the most useful gift, that gift should be curiosity.","It takes as much energy to wish as it does to plan.","What one has to do usually can be done.","I have spent many years of my life in opposition, and I rather like the role.","Life must be lived and curiosity kept alive. One must never, for whatever reason, turn his back on life.","I once had a rose named after me and I was very flattered. But I was not pleased to read the description in the catalogue: no good in a bed, but fine up against a wall.","Only a man's character is the real criterion of worth.","Friendship with ones self is all important, because without it one cannot be friends with anyone else in the world.","What you don't do can be a destructive force.","The battle for the individual rights of women is one of long standing and none of us should countenance anything which undermines it.","When will our consciences grow so tender that we will act to prevent human misery rather than avenge it?","I believe that anyone can conquer fear by doing the things he fears to do, provided he keeps doing them until he gets a record of successful experience behind him.","The only advantage of not being too good a housekeeper is that your guests are so pleased to feel how very much better they are.","I think that somehow, we learn who we really are and then live with that decision.","Too often the great decisions are originated and given form in bodies made up wholly of men, or so completely dominated by them that whatever of special value women have to offer is shunted aside without expression.","Campaign behavior for wives: Always be on time. Do as little talking as humanly possible. Lean back in the parade car so everybody can see the president.","The mother of a family should look upon her housekeeping and the planning of meals as a scientific occupation.","A little simplification would be the first step toward rational living, I think.","I'm so glad I never feel important, it does complicate life!","It isn't enough to talk about peace. One must believe in it. And it isn't enough to believe in it. One must work at it.","You can never really live anyone else's life, not even your child's. The influence you exert is through your own life, and what you've become yourself.","In all our contacts it is probably the sense of being really needed and wanted which gives us the greatest satisfaction and creates the most lasting bond.","Actors are one family over the entire world.","Since you get more joy out of giving joy to others, you should put a good deal of thought into the happiness that you are able to give.","Sometimes I wonder if we shall ever grow up in our politics and say definite things which mean something, or whether we shall always go on using generalities to which everyone can subscribe, and which mean very little.","Anyone who thinks must think of the next war as they would of suicide.","Remember always that you not only have the right to be an individual, you have an obligation to be one.","Freedom makes a huge requirement of every human being. With freedom comes responsibility. For the person who is unwilling to grow up, the person who does not want to carry his own weight, this is a frightening prospect.","Have convictions. Be friendly. Stick to your beliefs as they stick to theirs. Work as hard as they do.","Anyone who knows history, particularly the history of Europe, will, I think, recognize that the domination of education or of government by any one particular religious faith is never a happy arrangement for the people.","There are practical little things in housekeeping which no man really understands.","As for accomplishments, I just did what I had to do as things came along.","You can't move so fast that you try to change the mores faster than people can accept it. That doesn't mean you do nothing, but it means that you do the things that need to be done according to priority.","Ambition is pitiless. Any merit that it cannot use it finds despicable.","The only things one can admire at length are those one admires without knowing why.","I used to tell my husband that, if he could make me 'understand' something, it would be clear to all the other people in the country.","I think I lived those years very impersonally. It was almost as though I had erected someone outside myself who was the president's wife. I was lost somewhere deep down inside myself. That is the way I felt and worked until I left the White House.","The Bible illustrated by Dore occupied many of my hours - and I think probably gave me many nightmares.","My experience has been that work is almost the best way to pull oneself out of the depths.","I can not believe that war is the best solution. No one won the last war, and no one will win the next war.","When life is too easy for us, we must beware or we may not be ready to meet the blows which sooner or later come to everyone, rich or poor.","Hate and force cannot be in just a part of the world without having an effect on the rest of it.","Autobiographies are only useful as the lives you read about and analyze may suggest to you something that you may find useful in your own journey through life.","Old age has deformities enough of its own. It should never add to them the deformity of vice.","I do not think that I am a natural born mother... If I ever wanted to mother anyone, it was my father."],"Eleanor Smeal":["I have been studying women's political behavior since the early 1970s and first identified the gender gap in 1980 with the help of legendary pollster Louis Harris.","Since 1996, the Feminist Majority Foundation has been immersed in a campaign to support Afghan women and girls in their fight against the brutal oppression of the Taliban."],"Eleanor Tomlinson":["There is a lot of hype about drama school, I think.","I never trust anything that can be captured in 2 takes.","I love doing stunts. It's so much fun.","Well, Mom and Dad are both actors, and I've spent a lot of time watching my mom on stage and a lot of time on set with my dad, so it was very much a part of my growing up.","Wow, I think you grow all the time when you're working. You start the job and by the end of it, if it's a long one, you kind of say, 'My God, I was so different at the start of this job.' I always feel like I've changed for the better with each one.","I remember when I was younger. Dad's agent came round, and I asked if she would represent me. She didn't represent children at the time, but I wouldn't let her leave the house until she agreed. I've always been quite headstrong."],"Elena Anaya":["I can hypnotize rabbits.","I think I am incredibly generous with how much I give to my projects, but that's my generosity with the job.","Always, your work is the same: You have to tell a story, you have to make a character. It doesn't matter if there are thousands of dollars, millions behind it, or if there is nothing.","If you have what you want to say inside, and if you are crying for something that is true inside, it doesn't matter. The camera always sees it.","I love to fly. I always wanted to fly. It's been one of my dreams since I was 3 years old. I remember saying to my mom, 3 years old, every day, 'I can fly!' Living on the ninth floor, it was dangerous.","I always choose my projects for the script or what the director want to tell with that story. And if I like the story.","No one told me about boys. I had to figure it out myself. The first thing I learned was that sometimes they grow slower than women mentally.","There is something about this generation living now, that we don't accept death.","I'm 36 years old, and I'm growing up. Little by little.","I never go to a gym unless I have to for a role, a contract. I try to take care of myself as a human being, not because I have to be in front of the camera.","I am not generous about telling people who I am and what I like to do because it's my life and it only belongs to me and my friends and family.","I hope to grow up and see myself accepting myself and accepting time going by and everything falls.","Surgery is a complicated thing to talk about, but I guess it could also be a dangerous thing to play with if you're not very secure about what you're doing.","I'm not 20 anymore, and I feel it.","I hope to be 70 and sitting at the table with journalists, talking about my films."],"Elena Delle Donne":["That's the thing: You don't understand burnout unless you've been burned out. And it's something you can't even explain. It's just doing something you have absolutely no passion for.","I could do whatever I wanted as a girl, whatever my brother did. I could play against the boys and achieve whatever they did.","As I grew up, I became aware that there are people with special needs out there, and I have a real connection with them.","I thought I needed to go to one of the top five schools in the nation and never even thought 'What's important to me?' Instead of figuring out what was important, which was obviously being near home, I kind of just went with what everyone thought I should do.","I'd rather be a face for happiness and doing things that you have a passion for, rather than faking it and pretending like I'm this face of women's basketball, when I can't stand the sport at all.","I'm doing whatever I have to do to help my team win. So, instead of being focused on anything from the outside, I'm focused on winning and that next game.","It's expensive to raise a child with special needs, which people don't even think about. Emotionally it can be a struggle, but financially it's really rough.","You don't have to follow what most players do by going to the top school. You can do anything at any school you're at, as long as you're focused and you work hard.","Spend time with your family and try to spend time doing things that you enjoy doing other than basketball.","When I was young, I was obsessed with Michael Jordan and the Bulls. He's the only person I get starstruck over. I don't know what I'd do if I met him - I'd be in shock! That's my dream.","Every time I was playing basketball, I felt sick to my stomach. I didn't realize that feeling was having to leave my family - having to leave my sister, who can't even communicate with me when I'm gone.","Volleyball was a lot of fun, but I knew it wasn't my sport."],"Elena Kagan":["I have no regrets. I don't believe in looking back. What I am proudest of? Working really hard... and achieving as much as I could.","What my political views or my constitutional views are just doesn't matter.","The Supreme Court, of course, has the responsibility of ensuring that our government never oversteps its proper bounds or violates the rights of individuals. But the Court must also recognize the limits on itself and respect the choices made by the American people.","It was a very cool thing to be a smart girl, as opposed to some other, different kind. And I think that made a great deal of difference to me growing up and in my life afterward.","I owe a debt of gratitude to two other living Justices. Sandra Day O'Connor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg paved the way for me and so many other women in my generation. Their pioneering lives have created boundless possibilities for women in the law. I thank them for their inspiration and also for the personal kindnesses they have shown me.","In fact, corporate and union moneys go overwhelmingly to incumbents, so limiting that money, as Congress did in the campaign finance law, may be the single most self-denying thing that Congress has ever done.","I've led a school whose faculty and students examine and discuss and debate every aspect of our law and legal system. And what I've learned most is that no one has a monopoly on truth or wisdom. I've learned that we make progress by listening to each other, across every apparent political or ideological divide.","When the Senate ceases to engage nominees in meaningful discussion of legal issues, the confirmation process takes on an air of vacuity and farce, and the Senate becomes incapable of either properly evaluating nominees or appropriately educating the public.","I do not espouse the unitarian position. President Clinton's assertion of directive authority over administration, more than President Reagan's assertion of a general supervisory authority, raises serious constitutional questions.","I think the nine justices think the solicitor general is the 35th clerk.","It's not that there are no masters, but that there are many. And the job of the solicitor general is to balance those masters and to accommodate them all, each in their proper places, wisely and well and in so doing to represent the people of the United States.","And what my constitutional values are are wholly irrelevant to the job, and so neither you nor anyone else will know what they are.","I think that if there are positions that you can't argue... then the responsibility is probably to resign. If one's own conscience is opposed to the requirements and responsibilities of the job, then it's time to leave the job.","To have the opportunity to lead the Solicitor General's office is the honor of a lifetime. As you know, this is an office with a long and rich tradition, not only of extraordinary legal skill but also of extraordinary professionalism and integrity. That is due, in large measure, to the people who have led it.","If I am confirmed, I will commit to show Heller and the principles articulated in it the full measure of respect that is due to all constitution decisions of the court."],"Elena Kampouris":["I have blonde hair and blue eyes, and whenever I tell people I'm Greek, they don't believe me.","I've got my huge Greek family. I mean, I don't know how many cousins I have - I can't even keep track. There are just so many of us, and we love all Greek food - we have Greek night every Sunday night.","Greek blood courses through me.","Greeks are notorious for their potions. I wouldn't say I've used Windex, but there are so many tricks that have been handed down to me.","If I'm lucky enough to have the chance to play a character, I'm going to give it my all. Play my position and give it 100%.","Neither of my parents are involved in theater or acting, but they are very artistic. My mom is a painter; she's an artist. She went to school for fashion illustration. My father is into collecting antiques and fine wine, so they're both really creative people.","I've watched my mom take a plain piece of paper and create something beautiful out of it, and I think that kind of manifested for me in taking a character from the page and bringing that to life.","I can't tell you how lucky I feel. I've gotten to work Peter Facinelli 'American Odyssey,' and I got to do 'My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2' - which really gave me such a tremendous amount of pride and patriotism, and it was very close to my heart. I've really had such great support, so many great teachers, and so many wonderful people surrounding me.","There's no money in theater, but artistically speaking, it's so much more fulfilling! But, of course, there are still so many people left in film that I would love to work with as well - like Guy Ritchie! I'm a big fan of his work. He's at the top of my list of people I would love to collaborate with.","I was born into a Greek family, and it was instilled in me not only to be passionate about the culture but also to be freaky loyal."],"Elena Roger":["London has this culture of the theatre that is so big, it was a like a dream - but I never had a thought to be able to play here because my English was not very good. So being given the opportunity to come work here was like a gift.","I really enjoy spending time at home.","Sunday is the day I connect with Buenos Aires. I speak to or text my mother every day, but on Sunday I phone everyone.","My grandmother taught me to knit, and as I knit, my mind returns to my childhood.","I know I want to work for my whole life because I know I can't live without music or dancing. But I don't know if I want to be a big star.","I don't know if vocally I am so great.","I like to tell stories through dancing and singing.","At the age of 15 I began my singing lessons, and once I became a professional performer, I dove into acting.","I would like to play Broadway!","In Buenos Aires, I have a very close friend who speaks very good English, and she taught me. It was quite difficult because the muscles of your mouth are used to your language, and then when you want to speak another language, they don't go to the place they need to go to make the sound.","I met Patti LuPone and Elaine Paige in a party. I didn't speak too much with Patti, but she was lovely with me.","'Piaf' I did it because I wanted to do more theater instead of only musicals, and someone gave me the book and said to me, 'You have to do it.'","I didn't go to university, and I always had in my mind that I hadn't studied properly.","I went to the Conservatory, studying piano and singing, up to high school - but I only did four years because I then had to start working, and the jobs were so good that I didn't stop.","I feel that working now is the way for me to learn things, whether it's languages or another activity.","I've never been punched in the face, so I didn't know it would hurt so much!","I keep everything fans give me, if I can, but I do worry about when I run out of room in my house!","Sometimes Buenos Aires is not so safe. You are scared to have someone behind you at night.","I hate, hate Times Square!","When I am working, I have two shows on Saturday, and when I wake up, and it's a lovely day, I just cry. I'm joking: I love my job.","I love to be awful. There's nothing wrong with being awful.","I am not normal.","I remember one director in Argentina said to me, 'You are not going to have any opportunity to be a leading lady because of your height.' And I didn't care. I don't have a complex.","I thought that I'd never be able to work in films or TV. Another girl would be cutting her nose to be an actress. I was always very sure about myself."],"Elena Satine":["I'm fascinated by anything that deals with the unexplained. I love any show that totally makes me want to know more. How did they build these pyramids? Why did they find these carvings that look like spaceships?","It's funny how the ruthless, murderous gangster has really been romanticized by the media. I mean, I grew up watching the 'Godfathers' and 'Scarface,' and they were the coolest. They're just really interesting stories with great characters. They're rock stars.","I think I could totally be a gangster, but I could never be the kind of gangster that carries things out myself. I would have to be the kingpin that has my minions go and do the dirty bidding. I think I'd be pretty good at giving orders.","I just love scary stuff! I'm a huge horror buff.","I love dark humor that crosses the line and makes you say, 'That's so wrong!' And that's 'Family Guy' to me."],"Elena Vesnina":["Actually, I really wanted to play against Venus because I have so much respect for both Serena and Venus.","I will remember this day for the rest of my life. There is nothing you can say. It's just like you won the match after the earthquake and it just feels great.","I felt tight from the beginning of the match to the end. I couldn't relax.","I think this is the biggest win in my career. To beat Venus in Wimbledon is just something amazing.","For me it was just important to play my game and believe until the end. Even now, Venus is not in the top 10, but you can still feel she can be back again.","The Williams sisters, they have this power. They have this ability to come back from nowhere."],"Eleni Zaude Gabre-Madhin":["Anywhere the struggle is great, the level of ingenuity and inventiveness is high.","Happiness is the freedom of choice. The freedom to choose where to live, what to do, what to buy, what to sell, from whom, to whom, when and how.","One way to express choice is through the market. Well-functioning markets provide choices and, ultimately, the ability to express one's pursuit for happiness.","Like its agriculture, Africa's markets are highly under-capitalized and inefficient. We know from our work around the continent that transaction costs of reaching the market, and the risks of transacting in rural, agriculture markets, are extremely high. In fact, only one third of agricultural output produced in Africa even reaches the market.","We spend most of our lives cutting down our ambitions because the world has told us to think small. Dreams express what your soul is telling you, so as crazy as your dream might seem - even to you - I don't care: You have to let that out."],"Eleonora Duse":["If the sight of the blue skies fills you with joy, if a blade of grass springing up in the fields has power to move you, if the simple things of nature have a message that you understand, rejoice, for your soul is alive.","The one happiness is to shut one's door upon a little room, with a table before one, and to create; to create life in that isolation from life.","I did not use paint, I made myself up morally.","When we grow old, there can only be one regret - not to have given enough of ourselves.","The weaker partner in a marriage is the one who loves the most.","To help, to continually help and share, that is the sum of all knowledge; that is the meaning of art.","If I had my will I would live in a ship on the sea, and never come nearer to humanity than that!"],"Elettra Rossellini Wiedemann":["I'm not an impulse shopper. I will wait three days after I see something. Am I still thinking about it? Then I'll get it.","If I'm going to be working out two hours a day, I may as well have a goal... and I'm pretty competitive by nature. A triathlon is a new fun thing.","I like things clean, and I have a biannual clean-out of my apartment. I throw out raggedy things and things I never wear, and there's a Goodwill around the corner for anything worthwhile.","I don't speak up if I'm working. As a model, no one pays me for my opinion. I want to wear whatever will make a great photo, whether I like it or not. But if the shoes are too small, I will complain!","Models are like athletes: You burn hard and fast."],"Elfriede Jelinek":["Literature that keeps employing new linguistic and formal modes of expression to draft a panorama of society as a whole while at the same time exposing it, tearing the masks from its face - for me that would be deserving of an award.","In Austria, a rather authoritarian Catholic country, the role of the social admonisher traditionally fell to artists because there were no great political thinkers.","My inspiration came especially in the 1950s through the Vienna Group founded by writer H.C. Artmann. It showed me that if you want to say something, you have to let the language itself say it, because language is usually more meaningful than the mere content that one wishes to convey.","I think isolation is one of the greatest problems, an ever-growing obstacle to political solidarity.","I would gladly do it but I am suffering from social phobia. I cannot manage being in a crowd of people.","My training in music and composition then led me to a kind of musical language process in which, for example, the sound of the words I play with has to expose their true meaning against their will so to speak.","It could draw from a greater reservoir of freedom. The irony could develop an even greater ease.","Eroding solidarity paradoxically makes a society more susceptible to the construction of substitute collectives and fascisms of all kinds.","I cannot stand public attention, I just can't. Of course, if I may I might write something instead.","The government has once again made the right socially acceptable.","The problem is that it is difficult to translate.","I am not made to be pulled into the public as a person. I feel threatened there.","I'm not one of those women writers who are obsessed by their ego, possibly because I don't have one.","It's a wonderfully democratic method, publishing a text on the Internet.","I can really write what I want. I can take time; I can do nothing for a year. That is paradise.","It doesn't suit me as a person to be put on public display.","I don't do what I do willingly, but I have to do it.","I seek to cast an incorruptible gaze on women, especially where they are the accomplices of men.","My writings are limited to depicting analytically, but also polemically, the horrors of reality. Redemption is the speciality of other authors, male and female.","When I write, I have always tried to be on the side of the weak. The side of the powerful is not literature's side.","I associate the metaphor of sport with war. The unrest in the former Yugoslavia, after all, started with a football match that then became charged in nationalist ways and ended in violence.","It's interesting that the treatment of historical events by art precedes the civilisation of people through democracy.","As much as football can cause war, it can also cause peace. Football is a kind of Geiger counter of civilisation, or a catalyst for good as well as bad.","I am a sort of justice fanatic, and I always have to give a voice to those who get a raw deal.","The smaller a group, the easier it is for more people to argue and enter into discussions. The U.S. is vast. It's too large. The intellectuals hide out in enclaves, in big cities or universities, like a bunch of chickens hiding from a fox.","A woman who becomes famous through her work reduces her erotic value. A woman is permitted to chat or babble, but speaking in public with authority is still the greatest transgression.","How can the writer know reality if it is that which gets into him and sweeps him away, forever onto the sidelines.","I do not fight against men, but against the system that is sexist.","As is said about most writers, on the one hand, all I ever did from when I was a child was read, and I was a loner, which was furthered by my parents and my upbringing. On the other hand, the more I read, the more I felt this well-known fissure between me and the world.","I have the feeling it will influence my future writing to the extent that without any material worries I could develop a greater ease, even lightheartedness, in my writing.","I do not want to have the feeling of writing 'for eternity', so to speak.","My plays are made up of long monologues, which is similar to prose working with the language.","I find the Internet to be the most wonderful thing there is. It connects people. Everyone can have input.","As long as I have books and DVDs, I don't miss much.","I describe the relationship between man and woman as a Hegelian relationship between master and slave. As long as men are able to increase their sexual value through work, fame or wealth, while women are only powerful through their body, beauty and youth, nothing will change.","Internet is exemplary for me. I do not want to have the feeling of writing 'for eternity,' so to speak. The fleetingness of the Internet has therefore become very attractive to me."],"Elgin Baylor":["If you look up the definition of greatness in the dictionary, it will say Michael Jordan.","Coaching is easy. Winning is the hard part."],"Eli Biham":["I got many emails that brought to my attention that Mr. Ioan Mang... plagiarised a manuscript of mine, as well as papers of other people.","Using a special device, it's possible to steal calls and impersonate callers in the middle of a call as it's happening.","We can listen in to a call while it is still at the ringing stage and within a fraction of a second know everything about the user. Then we can listen in to the call.","Some biometric methods can't be taken from a person from afar without his or her agreement."],"Eli Broad":["You can have great teachers, but if you don't have a good principal, you won't have a good school.","Charity is just writing checks and not being engaged. Philanthropy, to me, is being engaged, not only with your resources but getting people and yourself really involved and doing things that haven't been done before.","You don't support politicians in their elections if whoever's seeking money only has a goal to stay in office or get in office. You have to pick the people who are going to do the best job.","Without a doubt, stem cell research will lead to the dramatic improvement in the human condition and will benefit millions of people.","To me, unconventional thinking is approaching a problem and asking, 'Why not? Why can't something be done?' If someone can't give me a good reason why you can't do something, I find a way to do it.","Collecting is more than just buying objects.","A lot of executives act like their time is worth more than anyone else's. But I always respect an employee who guards his or her time, even from me.","The best move you can make in negotiation is to think of an incentive the other person hasn't even thought of - and then meet it.","Civilizations are not remembered by their business people, their bankers or lawyers. They're remembered by the arts.","I have always believed that every great city in history needs a vibrant center.","How absurd that our students tuck their cell phones, BlackBerrys, iPads, and iPods into their backpacks when they enter a classroom and pull out a tattered textbook.","I'd rather be respected than loved.","Oprah Winfrey's global influence is unparalleled. Not only has her generosity and firm belief that education is the key to a better life benefited countless women and children around the world, but her example has also inspired millions of people to give back in ways big and small.","The happiest people I've found are in science. These people have three times the IQ - maybe I'm exaggerating. They have a higher IQ than I do. They love what they're doing, they have a good family life, they're satisfied.","The inability to delegate is one of the biggest problems I see with managers at all levels.","I've become convinced that Los Angeles is going to become the next contemporary art capital - no other city has more contemporary gallery space than Los Angeles. We've come into our own, finally.","Museums do not share their collections with other museums unless they get something in exchange. The Metropolitan will deal with the Louvre, but will they send their stuff to Memphis? No.","I've never been one who enjoys maintaining the status quo. I'm always pushing for new ideas, whether it's in business or philanthropy.","School boards are, for the most part,made up of political wannabes who see a board seat as a stepping stone for political office, or well-meaning parents who represent an ethnic group or geography, or have some other narrow interests. Few people on them understand what governance is about.","I never stay anywhere - parties, museums, meetings - longer than three hours.","I believe in two things: One, Andrew Carnegie said, 'He who dies with wealth dies in shame.' And someone once said, 'He who gives while he lives also knows where it goes.'","In high school, I would drive my teachers batty. They would make a statement, and I would say, 'Why is that?' They didn't want to be questioned.","I think the opera is one of the great cultural jewels of Los Angeles.","The first dream I had was just to get a college education. I got through college in three years, taking extra classes in summer school.","It's critical that states improve how teachers are trained, recruited, evaluated, compensated, advanced, and retained.","I'd be bored to death if I spent all my time with other businesspeople, bankers and lawyers.","Los Angeles is one of the four cultural capitals of the world, but we don't attract as many cultural tourists as New York, London or Paris. I want to change that.","I'm strong-willed. Architects are strong-willed. You get the best results with a strong client and a strong architect working together.","People don't know I've got a deep social conscience. I'm a child of the Depression, born in 1933. My parents were very liberal in their social views.","If you ask why I do what I do - I want to make a difference. I don't just want to maintain the status quo. I want to help people, to work with institutions or create ones when they don't exist.","Philanthropy is activism.","If people want to criticize me because it sells papers, that's fine. I just don't like it when it's inaccurate.","I don't like to spend time in endless meetings talking about stuff that isn't going to get anything done. I have meetings, but they're short, prompt and to the point.","I don't want to be in the film business. I'm not even sure it's a business.","My wife was the first art collector in the family, and I didn't become interested until around 1973. The first important artwork we bought was a Van Gogh drawing of two peasant houses in Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer.","Most museums - with all their burdens to pay for exhibitions, administration, and security - really don't have any money really to acquire art, with few exceptions.","Los Angeles is such a great meritocracy. Where can someone with my background - don't have the right family background, the right religion, the right provenance or whatever you want to call it - I come here and I'm accepted. The city's been good to me. And I want to give back.","The first thing I started collecting was stamps. Until I started discovering girls. That was the end of stamps.","Any city in America would like to get a museum built if they didn't have to pay for it.","The American people frankly have been, over many, many years - to be blunt - fat, dumb and happy. If they want their children to compete with children in India, China or Korea, they better get them a far better education.","As the son of a union activist and a lifelong Democrat, I've always thought that privatizing our public schools is not the answer. We must strengthen public schools.","The biggest barrier we've seen to student progress is this: School policies and practices often prevent good teachers from doing great work and even dissuade some talented Americans from entering the profession. This needs to change.","It's hard to explain your emotions when you see a work of art.","Twombly, frankly, was an acquired taste. I was not in love with Twombly the first time I saw one of his paintings.","I think over any period of time, especially if you don't use leverage, it is difficult to continually beat the S&P 500.","I don't think it makes any sense for an individual to invest in common stocks unless they know the company, work at the company, and so on.","A real collector does not sell.","There were periods when the art market got overheated, but there is no reason it should appreciate dramatically.","I am old enough to remember when America's K-12 public schools were the best in the world. I am a proud graduate of them, and I credit much of my success to what I learned in Detroit Public Schools and at Michigan State University.","Frankly, I'm not sure how far I would get if I attended public school today. It's not just that public schools aren't producing the results we want - it's that we're not giving them what they need to help students achieve at high levels. K-12 education in the United States is deeply antiquated.","School district policies and practices have not kept pace with student and teacher needs.","You always learn lessons in business.","I could live anywhere in the world I want. But Los Angeles is the place to live.","I've got a big ego, I admit it; I'm ego-driven.","In America, what you've accomplished financially is a measurement, whether you like it or not.","I believe that a newspaper is a great civic asset and that ownership is best in the hands of foundations or wealthy families that want to own it for reasons other than maximizing profits. I also believe newspapers should remain in local hands.","Anything I do, I spend a lot of time. I do it with passion and intensity. I want to be in charge.","Art evokes emotion. It doesn't have to be a thing of beauty.","My family and I have been blessed with good fortune in the world of business. We've created quite a net worth. My children, two boys, have more money than they will ever need, and they aren't empire builders.","Being a Midwesterner, I know that many of the middle-class manufacturing jobs that had been at the heart of our economy are either gone or going, and they're not coming back.","I'm naturally curious, and I read four newspapers a day.","For businesses to be successful, they need to constantly ask the question: 'How can we provide value to our customers?' At the end of the day, that is what matters.","Someone once told me I'm a sore winner, and they're right. I rarely take more than a moment to enjoy a success before I'm moving on and looking for the next challenge.","What artists think about the world is often different from how we businessmen see it, and I find that an enriching experience.","Artists rarely do the same thing over and over again. Art is about the new, doing things in a new way.","I can't think of another enterprise other than being a homeowner that can't have its debt restructured in bankruptcy. Corporations can but a homeowner can't? Now with securitization the homeowner can't go to the owner of the loan and work things out.","Managers are responsible for setting workplace policies under which teachers can succeed. Managers are responsible for negotiating contracts that create the conditions under which teachers can succeed.","The unions no longer control the education agenda of the Democratic Party.","If you have poor management that's not doing the right job, you end up with unions filling the void and... page after page of work rules and thicker and thicker contracts.","I believe in the democratization of the arts. What do I mean by that? I think museums, with some exceptions, have a responsibility to educate a much broader public.","Teach For America provides one of the most critical pipelines for bringing new talent into public education.","People would rather have art or gold instead of paper money.","Every artist is unreasonable, because he or she is doing something that hasn't been done before.","People think it's strange how briskly I move through museums. Sure, I could stand in front of each piece and stare at it for a good long time. But that's not me.","Unfortunately, the boards of art institutions tend to be populated with well-meaning supporters of the arts who often lack any business background or appetite for imposing appropriate discipline.","Time is the most valuable thing you have - and I'm not just talking about the minutes for which you're paid.","I never play golf because it takes too long, and the business connections it produces can be made just as easily over an early breakfast.","I don't see myself as a great discoverer of artists, like Charles Saatchi."],"Eli Manning":["In New York, they like winners. They don't like second place.","As a player, that's not your responsibility to comment and to give your opinion on another player. As a quarterback, I don't want another quarterback tweeting about my performance or judging me in that way.","I'm going to go out and be the best quarterback I can be and get the most out of my potential.","I'm the type of person who loves to stay busy, even in my off-season.","Opportunities are running out, and this is the do-or-die situation when the ball is in your hands, and you can either help your team to victory or not. And so I want to be in those situations. I think about them, and almost look forward to them.","I'm not worried about where I rank between other QBs in the league.","I'm the opposite of jealous.","I think a lot of guys want a son because of all of the things they do while growing up. A lot of guys want to share those experiences with their own sons.","Tom Brady is a great quarterback, he's a great player, and what you've seen with him is he's gotten better every year.","I'm not a 25-interception quarterback, I know that.","I'm worried about doing my best, playing to my potential, helping out my teammates, and trying to win games for the Giants.","I went through that phase where I wanted to almost be different than my brother. Just kind of argued a little louder or if there was a curfew, I always came in a little later than I was supposed to. If it was set for 12, I would come in at 12:45. I would test the limits a little. There was no real reason and I grew out of it, eventually.","I like making fun of myself; I don't want to make fun of other people, so I don't mind doing something out of character that some people might not expect me to do.","As soon as you make mistakes, or you have an off year, even if it's not your fault as a quarterback... I've always said the quarterback and the head coach always get too much blame when you lose and too much credit when you win.","The quarterback, you can play with a lot of big injuries. You get a little injury like an index finger or a thumb that most people can play with, sometimes you can't. I've stayed away from some of those."],"Eli Pariser":["To be a good citizen, it's important to be able to put yourself in other people's shoes and see the big picture. If everything you see is rooted in your own identity, that becomes difficult or impossible.","I think it's easier than ever to hear only what you want to hear. That doesn't make a good citizen.","If you Google some sites about the link between vaccines and autism, you can very quickly find that Google is repeating back to you your view about whether that link exists and not what scientists know, which is that there isn't a link between vaccines and autism. It's a feedback loop that's invisible.","We thought that the Internet was going to connect us all together. As a young geek in rural Maine, I got excited about the Internet because it seemed that I could be connected to the world. What it's looking like increasingly is that the Web is connecting us back to ourselves.","It feels great to have your own views reflected back to you, and you feel so right, but actually it's very dangerous. Because to make good decisions, you need to have a clear view of what all the options are.","Whether it's Facebook or Google or the other companies, that basic principle that users should be able to see and control information about them that they themselves have revealed to the companies is not baked into how the companies work. But it's bigger than privacy. Privacy is about what you're willing to reveal about yourself.","There's the idea that people should be able to control how the information that they're giving to websites is used and monetized in a more clear and powerful way. That's something that probably will need government action.","The important thing to remember with the Internet is that there are large companies that have an interest in controlling how information flows in it. They're very effective at lobbying Congress, and that pattern has locked down other communication media in the past. And it will happen again unless we do something about it.","I think that people post to social media to help shape their public identity.","Rather than saying people aren't interested when things don't take off, you should take it on yourself to say, 'I'm not doing a great job of telling the story in a way that makes it interesting.'","If you only have one shot at writing a headline, there's a lot of pressure.","If you look at the history of how information flows, there was a time that newspapers were kind of in the place that Google and Facebook are now - how do we get more people to buy a copy? Then there was a shift in the early 20th century. They needed to do better, and readers and consumers demanded that of them.","Democracy actually requires that the whole public be able to see common problems and address them and step outside of their own sort of narrow self-interest to do so."],"Eli Roth":["Natural disasters are terrifying - that loss of control, this feeling that something is just going to randomly end your life for absolutely no reason is terrifying. But, what scares me is the human reaction to it and how people behave when the rules of civility and society are obliterated.","Las Vegas is a 24-hour city. It never stops.","When people direct insults at me, I can take it.","If you are having fun on the set, you are not getting things done.","People want to be disturbed when they go see a horror movie.","My phobias worsen as I get older. I'm scared of flying, driving. I'm terrified of sharks. I'm a germaphobe. But I try to face my fears; I do. Well, most of them.","Creative writing and shooting are muscles that atrophy. But when you work them, you become a self-generator who can branch out.","I like to take risks and do weird things and stuff that's not normal compared to other Hollywood movies. Not stuff that's totally avant garde and daring, but doing stuff that's in other languages and not using stars and using real people - things that they generally don't do in mainstream films.","'Cabin Fever' was very much inspired by 'The Thing.' It's really a perfect guy's horror movie: There's no love story, it's just straight-up horror. And it's so well-done. It moves at a slow pace, but it's really terrific.","Much of my youth was spent in the parking lot or inside a Dunkin' Donuts.","I have no tattoos. There's nothing I've even been that into to get a tattoo of it.","I've always been fascinated by the idea that there's no such thing as evil; it's all in your point of view. To one group a suicide bomber is the antichrist and to one he's a hero.","I think that horror films have a very direct relationship to the time in which they're made. The films that really strike a film with the public are very often reflecting something that everyone, consciously or unconsciously feeling - atomic age, post 9-11, post Iraq war; it's hard to predict what people are going to be afraid of.","'Eraserhead' is a weird, horrible nightmare, and it doesn't narratively make sense. Stuff's happening, but you honestly feel like you're in a nightmare, and it has such disturbing imagery that it stays with you forever once you've seen it.","I think that many people are ashamed when they feel afraid. There's this thing in our society that you're not allowed to feel scared. You have to be a man and put on a brave face, but we all have fears.","Chile could work as a double for L.A.; it's very production-friendly and there's terrific talent down there.","I have the infinite galaxy from '2001' as my screensaver - so if I space out while I'm writing and it goes to screensaver, I can just stare off into the stars.","Possession and exorcism is something that's in every religion and every culture. It's a real primal fear: Is the body a vessel for our spirits? What happens if something else takes over it? Where does the spirit go?","Even post-WWII, nobody talked about the Holocaust. It wasn't until the '50s that people started talking about it.","When you make a film for a million and a half dollars and it opens at 20 million, the next question out of everyone's mouth is, 'When's the next one, when's the next one, when's the next one?'","I would love to do a musical!","Look at comic books. It used to be something that only geeks were into. And now it's everywhere.","I love movies. I mean, I really, really love movies.","Horror audiences don't need to see some TV actor they're familiar with.","I get a little too obsessive with work.","I need to eliminate 'like' from my vocabulary. I begin sentences with, 'That's seriously like... ' I hear myself talking in this Los Angeles high-school student kind of way, and I hate it.","I have so many different projects, I hear voices in my head - the characters talking all at once - and I have to write to make them stop.","I've always dreamed of having a year-round haunted house.","There's a crazy, false notion that audiences are not patient or will not watch a story, that you have to put in a scare every ten minutes. But I always thought that was insane.","It's just assumed that a horror sequel is going to be bad. It's never going to be as good as the first one.","Once I got over the fear of writing female characters, it actually came quite easily and I was really happy with it. I just thought about girls I knew really, really well and I'd just have conversations with them and tried to relay how they talk about certain things.","I want people to see my name on a movie, pay money and know they're going to be entertained for 90 minutes.","Anytime you make a movie, the goal is a wide theatrical release, with the right distributor.","As a kid, my idols were Sam Raimi and Peter Jackson, and I get into crazy races with myself. Raimi was 21 when he made movies, and when I didn't get 'Cabin Fever' made that fast I thought I'd failed.","What is important to me is that people know I respect the business of making movies.","I generally follow my own compass and make films about what's scaring me.","I think characters are most terrifying when they're relatable. It's best when your most horrible characters make sense, and are believable. That's when a movie is most terrifying.","You know, I'm from Boston, and in Boston, you are born with a baseball bat in your hand.","I feel like in the '90s, horror just lost its way and everything became so safe and watered-down.","When I go see an R-rated horror movie, I want lots of violence.","I'd love to see us get to a point where you can make a movie and not worry about the limits of the violence. Then I think they'd get so violent that people would get bored of it.","There's fear in everything, but we can't just succumb to that. We have to suppress it, so we get used to suppressing fear to make it through the our day. Otherwise, we'd become paralyzed by them.","Horror is like comedy. Woody Allen's comedy is going to be very different from Ben Stiller's comedy which is going to be different from Adam Sandler's comedy which is going to be different from Judd Apatow's comedy. They're all comedy, but they're all very different types and you can enjoy all of them. Horror is the same way.","Well, anytime I make a movie, I like to load it up with more things than you could ever catch on the first viewing.","I never put out a vanilla edition of a DVD.","Anytime you're the first to speak out against something, there's going to be a backlash.","I've realized that I can't multitask in the writing department; I can only kind of do one thing at a time.","Horror movies are the best date movies. There's no wondering, 'When do I put my arm around her?'","The best movies now are called 'thrillers.' Because if you use the word 'horror,' people's associations are straight-to-video crap.","I love historical movies. I want to make a violent medieval epic.","Some disaster movies look like you're watching someone else play video games. They're fun but it's not real.","Everyone is so terrified of being labeled a racist.","I look at careers like Ben Stiller and think that's a great career to have where you're doing movies that you write and direct, and also act in films, although he's primarily an actor.","There's something very scary about exposing yourself on camera, knowing that you're going to be put on thousands of screens around the world for everyone to judge, but there's also something very thrilling and exciting about it.","What's important for me is staying healthy.","You know, the dirty secret in the Director's Guild is that the average life expectancy of Director's Guild members is 57 years old. The stress level is so high and directors are generally really out of shape, cause they sit in the chair and they eat craft service.","Movie stars need to retain some of that mystique if you are a big movie star.","As a director, you have to know what actors are doing. You're the one telling them what to do. The actors' job is to come prepared to the set, but sometimes, if they're beginning actors or people who are non-actors, you have to teach them how to act.","I'm not interested in going after a part. I think if someone wants me for a part and approaches me then I'll take it on a case-by-case basis and see what that part is.","I love movies that are just straight-up exploitation, but the ones that endure and the ones that last are the ones where the filmmakers put in that extra level of thought; after 25 years you put them on in front of an audience, and they'll respond to it and enjoy it.","I think you should make movies as long as the story dictates.","What I've always thought I would do is make a bunch of movies and then stop to teach for awhile. And then just teach at film schools - you know, teach children.","Believe it or not, but I was a camp councilor for three years. I love kids.","I think in life we get very caught up in the minutia and, unfortunately, it generally takes some sort of tragedy in your life to put things in perspective.","Life is a series of avoiding horrible situations until ultimately you're dead. That's how I feel about things.","'Troll 2' is one of the rare sequels where you don't have to waste time watching the first one, since the films have absolutely nothing to do with one another.","When I was 22, I had this horrible psoriasis outbreak. It was all over my legs, I couldn't walk because my legs were cracked and bleeding. Weird things like that can happen to your body.","I can think of endless horrible things to do to people!","The scariest people are usually the sweetest.","I have control issues. For sure, no question.","As a kid, I was the neighbourhood baby-sitter - very responsible, always in charge.","It's very flattering to feel like you actually helped create a sub-genre.","Twitter is wonderful. You can kill rumours instantly.","I think horror should never be safe, whether it's violent or non violent.","When you're making a television show, it's about the story and arc of the show rather than any particular episode or director.","The film, 'Aftershock,' for me is really about how the minor problems in life that we think are so major ultimately mean nothing when a tragedy happens, when a real problem happens.","The one negative to horror is that it's always law of diminishing returns. When you go in the funhouse, the ride is never scary the second time. You will never have that pure experience as when you first watch it.","A comedy can actually get funnier and funnier. Even though you know the joke, you enjoy it so much, it's the facial expression, you laugh. The laugh doesn't wear off. It could be with you for thirty years.","One of the great joys of life, now that you can afford a nice suit, is getting one for free. That's why I like to do press tours - I always say making movies is just an excuse to get free clothing.","When someone throws up while watching one of your movies, it's like a standing ovation.","If someone gets up and walks out of the movie, it means it's really affected them.","You know, the best thing you can say about a horror film is, 'Don't see it.'","I think filmmakers, in general... There are some awesome, really great filmmakers - but on the whole, filmmakers, actors, I think they are the biggest bunch of whiny, over-paid babies on the planet.","I saw 'Alien' when I was 8 years old. To me, it was like a combination of Jaws and Star Wars, and that's the movie that made me want to be a director.","Lucio Fulci is such a massively underrated director. Everyone knows him as the Godfather of Gore.","'Beatrice Cenci' was an amazing film. If it were released today it'd win Best Picture. It's so well done, it's so contemporary, and the filmmaking is so smart.","For a long time, I had a crazy girl dating habit.","I have a strong art-history background."],"Eli Wallach":["When you have to shoot, shoot, don't talk.","Having the critics praise you is like having the hangman say you've got a pretty neck.","Yes, I won the Bafta. I thought the British were very intelligent.","When I saw the movie, I said, I wish I had heard the music. I would have ridden the horse differently.","Well, I've maybe gotten 200 requests for interviews about Marilyn, and I just decided I'm gonna do my own.","Well, I was getting a lot of money then, and I wasn't getting any Hollywood films, so I just did those. I'd always do a play in between. Whenever I ran low on funds, I'd always rush off to do a movie somewhere.","Well, I go to the theater today, and its curtain - there is no curtain in this play; the lights go down and go up - and we start. And I live this character for two hours. There are only two of us in the play. And It's a complete experience.","This country has a complex about age. It's unbelievable. If you're over thirty, you've had it in this country.","The trouble with that movie is that you had to see Chinatown the day before you saw The Two Jakes.","The big secret in acting is listening to people.","So I wanted to show what I did with the money. So I got red silk shirts, beautiful hats, wonderful saddles, a great horse, and two gold teeth. So that was the way I did it.","One thing changes every evening: It's the audience, and I'm working my magic. I'm always learning from it.","My wife says that stage acting is like being on a tightrope with no net, and being in the movies, there is a net - because you stop and go over it again. It's very technical and mechanical. On stage you're on your own.","My first Western was called The Magnificent Seven.","John Huston was a superb master. He knew how to make good films. I did three things with him. One is called Independence. It plays in Philadelphia, for free. It's been playing there for 25 years.","I've worked with wonderful actors like Marlon Brando and Henry Fonda.","I've never lost my appetite for acting; it's innovative and challenging.","I've learned that life is very tricky business: Each person needs to find what they want to do in life and not be dissuaded when people question them.","I'd come out of the army after five years as a medic. I was a medical administrator and we ran hospitals, and I was a Captain in the army at the end, in 1945.","I was an original member of the Actors' Studio.","I never lost my appetite for acting.","I never dreamed I would do Westerns.","I met my wife and, for the next ten years, we did no films at all. She did the first movie and then I did several after. My first movie was written by Tennessee Williams and directed by Kazan and was called Baby Doll.","I love to tell stories and this is my way of getting them down on paper.","I always wanted to tell stories and act.","I always end up being the evil one, and I wouldn't hurt a fly.","Everyone thinks acting is easy. It's far from easy, but it's the most gratifying thing I do.","Even if I don't want to slow down, I'm slowing down.","But I went to the University of Texas in the 30s, and while there I learned to ride. Mostly polo ponies.","But Clint I love, because Clint was my mentor. I knew nothing about making an Italian movie.","And then the first was The Misfits, which I enjoyed very much, with Marilyn and Gable.","And that movie was underrated - Nuts - because it deals with a terrible subject, but It's very well done.","And I did Batman, too. I did Mr. Freeze. I get more mail for him than anything I've ever done.","All of these stories bounced around in my mind for a long time.","What is it in my makeup that makes me grab any offer and fly around the world? Will I ever be satisfied? Can't I ever just rest?"],"Eli Whitney":["I can make just such ones if I had tools, and I could make tools if I had tools to make them with.","I have now taken a serious task upon myself and I fear a greater one that is in the power of any man to perform in the given time-but it is too late to go back.","One of my primary objects is to form the tools so the tools themselves shall fashion the work and give to every part its just proportion.","I have always believed that I should have had no difficulty in causing my rights to be respected.","I have not only Arms but a large proportion of Armourers to make.","You are undoubtedly acquainted with my Reputation, and as for my Penmanship it must speak for itself; this is to desire your Approbation to keep a public school."],"Eli Yishai":["We need to flatten entire neighborhoods in Gaza. Flatten all of Gaza. The Americans didn't stop with Hiroshima - the Japanese weren't surrendering fast enough, so they hit Nagasaki, too. There should be no electricity in Gaza, no gasoline or moving vehicles, nothing.","We have to protect and do our utmost to fortify the walls of Judaism in the land of Israel through legislation that will guard the unique Jewish character of the state of Israel.","A convert, if he converts through the Orthodox, he has the Jewish gene. If he doesn't convert through the Orthodox, he doesn't have the Jewish gene. As simple as that.","Israelis are displaying buds of xenophobia.","South Tel Aviv has turned into the garbage can of the country.","I sound like a racist, a benighted man or a xenophobe, but I'm motivated by love for my country and the knowledge that I don't have another country.","I don't want, under any circumstances, to see in 'Haaretz' a picture of a woman with a baby in her arms crying while policemen deport her.","Gays and lesbians are sick people. It's definitely a disease. They haven't invented a cure for it yet, but I hope they will.","The Land of Israel needs to build and be built, period.","Admitting hundreds of thousands of infiltrators is an existential threat to the State of Israel.","Let's set things straight... there are 300 million people living in countries within the Nile basin in horrific economic and security conditions. The $500 that they earn in Israel every month is an annual salary in their countries of origin.","I'm not the Eritrean welfare minister and not the Sudanese labor minister.","Democracies take time.","This stereotype that haredim don't serve in the army and contribute is false and always was.","The true and correct solution to eradicating discrimination is by establishing religious Sepharadi educational institutions. This is one of the reasons Shas was founded.","We are losing the Jewish people in the Diaspora.","If you want to be Jewish, welcome, but convert via the Halacha.","Empires came and went while we, the Jewish people, persecuted relentlessly, facing expulsions and pogroms and the Holocaust, survived. We survived thanks to the Torah and faith in the Lord.","One cannot forsake the security of Israelis.","A law is a law, and it has to be respected.","Construction in Jerusalem cannot be halted.","Syria is still the foundation of the axis of evil, and I'm not sure it's appropriate to transfer Israel's northern front to the axis of evil.","If it was up to me, I would send the gay community, who insisted on celebrating in Jerusalem, to Sodom and Gomorrah.","Destroy and damage infrastructure, public buildings and government buildings. Do not leave them any place from which they can operate to damage Israel. We must be sure that Hamas will be spending many years in rebuilding Gaza and not in attacking Israel.","I support peace.","Put an end to talk on dividing Jerusalem. There can be no negotiations about Jerusalem.","It is inconceivable that ministers of the Israeli government choose a car whose features are unnecessary luxuries in addition to being produced in Germany.","Israel is the only democratic country in the Middle East.","Ahmed Tibi does not recognize the existence of the state of Israel, and letting him into the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee is a serious danger to its security.","The state of Israel will stand as one entity against any attempt to boycott its products.","There is not another country that is as sensitive as Israel is to the rights of foreigners.","There has always been this feeling among the religious public of, 'Why can't we all unite?' Shas, UTJ, Jewish Home... But, of course, the differences between the political parties in practice are too big to bridge.","I walk around haredi neighborhoods freely, and I actually receive a lot of positive responses from people.","One must know to lose honorably.","I am not the type of politician who will tell you I am going to act for my own benefit. The answer is no, I will continue to serve the public."],"Elia Kazan":["Anybody who informs on other people is doing something disturbing and even disgusting.","The world was like a huge red carpet out ahead of me to be walked on. And it stretched on and on, no end.","Whatever hysteria exists is inflamed by mystery, suspicion and secrecy. Hard and exact facts will cool it.","Every fighter has one fight that makes or breaks him.","I was not what you'd call a first-class actor, but I did all right.","The more ambivalent you are and the more uncertain you are, then you can get something that you cannot anticipate.","To be a member of the Communist Party is to have a taste of the police state. It is a diluted taste but is bitter and unforgettable.","I spoke without fear of contradiction. I simply did not suffer self-doubt.","I've lost many of my best friends... I'm going to satisfy myself now, not the critics, not even my friends.","The belief that the good in American society will finally win out... I don't believe any more.","Hey, you must be doin' good, 'cause I never hear from you.","The motion pictures I have made and the plays I have chosen to direct represent my convictions.","I used to spend most of my time straining to be a nice guy so people would like me.","The essence of the stage is concentration and penetration. Of the screen action, movement, sweep.","I truly believe that all power corrupts. Such is probably the thinking behind every political film ever made in Hollywood.","I hate the Communists and have for many years and don't feel right about giving up my career to defend them. I will give up my film career if it is in the interests of defending something I believe in, but not this.","What's called a difficult decision is a difficult decision because either way you go there are penalties.","The writer, when he is also an artist, is someone who admits what others don't dare reveal.","I would rather do what I did than crawl in front of a ritualistic Left and lie the way those other comrades did betray my own soul.","I'm small, but I'm neither compliant nor agreeable.","I joined the Communist Party late in 1934. I got out a year and a half later.","I knew the exuberance of playing before an admiring audience and hearing my secret voice.","There was no doubt that there was a vast organization which was making fools of all the liberals in Hollywood and taking their money, that there was a police state among the Left element in Hollywood and Broadway.","I value peace when it is not bought at the price of fundamental decencies.","I have no spy stories to tell, because I saw no spies. Nor did I understand, at that time, any opposition between American and Russian national interest.","I was taken in by what might be called the Hard Times version of the Communists' advertising or recruiting technique.","I was not a collective person or a bohemian; I was an elitist.","I was the hero of the young insurgent working class art movement.","I think there should be collaboration, but under my thumb.","Miller didn't write Death of a Salesman. He released it. It was there inside him, waiting to be turned loose. That's the measure of its merit.","The Communists automatically violated the daily practices of democracy to which I was accustomed.","I was an outsider... but I was also sympathetic with people that were struggling to get up, because I struggled to get up.","Acting... was the biggest charge I ever had. What other artist has it so good? Approval so quick?","I was always a self-conscious person.","I wouldn't go up on a stage now if you paid a thousand dollars for one minute of acting. It's a nasty experience. You're up there all by yourself. You're so damn exposed.","I was very intense. I think it's a privilege to be an actor.","You can't just sit there and do the lines. You have to do something revealing or unusual.","You have to remind people of their own struggles. It's a responsibility.","I was even superior to the Communists and when they didn't go along with me, I quit them.","I was the true future. I understood Communism better than they did.","For years after I resigned, I was still faithful to their way of thinking. But not in the American Communists.","I gave my life to the Group Theatre, because in it I'm building something for myself. What I build, I am.","Very often the Group actor is a critic when he's acting and an actor when he's criticizing.","There is only one thing I respect in so-called Broadway actors... and that is their competitive sense.","I may be getting old, but not foolish.","I owe Bankhead a gift; she made a director out of me.","I will say nothing to an actor that cannot be translated into action.","Every picture that is successful has one little miracle in it.","A film director has to get a shot, no matter what he does. We're desperate people.","I didn't have that much confidence. Maybe it looks that way. I'm glad it does.","The makers of entertainment must try, in our field, to be honest and grown-up.","Our relationship was cursed by the fact that we agreed on everything.","I question the value of stars. I think they're overrated. They get too much money, too much praise.","A good director's not sure when he gets on the set what he's going to do.","I like directors who come on the set and create something that's a little dangerous, difficult or unusual.","The first thing you should do with an actor is not sign a contract with him. Take him to dinner. And take him for a walk afterwards.","When you know what an actor has, you can reach in and arouse it. If you don't know what he has, you don't know what the hell is going on.","I said to Tennessee, this thing is becoming the Marlon Brando show.","Stylized acting and direction is to realistic acting and direction as poetry is to prose.","The physical life of the scene is determined by whether the set squeezes people together or whether the set has an escape place in it.","You have no idea how fragile an actor's self-worth is.","I'm going to make a film where not one word is really important. I'm going to make it all action.","I don't remember anything anybody said in any Jack Ford picture. Nothing happens except action.","The thing about Brando was that I'd make these directions, and he'd walk away. He'd heard enough... to get the machine going.","I was both very successful and very left; the living demonstration of how you could be on the left and still be in the gossip columns and be envied for the money you made.","I want to thank the Academy for its courage and generosity.","You've got to keep fighting - you've got to risk your life every six months to stay alive."],"Elian Gonzalez":["Because he'll take me to Cuba and I don't want to go to Cuba.","I'd like to go to Cuba.","It's the least that someone can do, someone like me that owes so much to this people and to the revolution: study hard, but more than that, defend them under any circumstance.","Wherever I go, there's always a child, an old woman, that comes to me and wants to meet me. Not because I am famous but because they suffered with my family.","I don't profess to have any religion, but if I did, my God would be Fidel Castro. He is like a ship that knew to take his crew on the right path.","Fidel Castro for me is like a father."],"Elias Canetti":["Success is the space one occupies in the newspaper. Success is one day's insolence.","His head is made of stars, but not yet arranged into constellations.","One should not confuse the craving for life with endorsement of it.","The fear of burglars is not only the fear of being robbed, but also the fear of a sudden and unexpected clutch out of the darkness.","As if one could know the good a person is capable of, when one doesn't know the bad he might do.","The profoundest thoughts of the philosophers have something trickle about them. A lot disappears in order for something to suddenly appear in the palm of the hand.","Whenever you observe an animal closely, you feel as if a human being sitting inside were making fun of you.","Words are not too old, only people are too old if they use the same words too frequently.","Success listens only to applause. To all else it is deaf.","All the things one has forgotten scream for help in dreams.","Justice requires that everyone should have enough to eat. But it also requires that everyone should contribute to the production of food.","When you write down your life, every page should contain something no one has ever heard about.","There is no doubt: the study of man is just beginning, at the same time that his end is in sight.","Someone who always has to lie discovers that every one of his lies is true.","One should use praise to recognize what one is not.","Rulers who want to unleash war know very well that they must procure or invent a first victim.","Most religions do not make men better, only warier.","People love as self-recognition what they hate as an accusation.","There is nothing that man fears more than the touch of the unknown. He wants to see what is reaching towards him, and to be able to recognize or at least classify it. Man always tends to avoid physical contact with anything strange.","The process of writing has something infinite about it. Even though it is interrupted each night, it is one single notation.","Adults find pleasure in deceiving a child. They consider it necessary, but they also enjoy it. The children very quickly figure it out and then practice deception themselves.","He who is obsessed by death is made guilty by it.","Whether or not God is dead: it is impossible to keep silent about him who was there for so long.","A 'modern' man has nothing to add to modernism, if only because he has nothing to oppose it with. The well-adapted drop off the dead limb of time like lice.","It doesn't matter how new an idea is: what matters is how new it becomes.","There is no such thing as an ugly language. Today I hear every language as if it were the only one, and when I hear of one that is dying, it overwhelms me as though it were the death of the earth.","The paranoiac is the exact image of the ruler. The only difference is their position in the world. One might even think the paranoiac the more impressive of the two because he is sufficient unto himself and cannot be shaken by failure.","Every decision is liberating, even if it leads to disaster. Otherwise, why do so many people walk upright and with open eyes into their misfortune?","Pessimists are not boring. Pessimists are right. Pessimists are superfluous.","People's fates are simplified by their names.","The great writers of aphorisms read as if they had all known each other well.","The planet's survival has become so uncertain that any effort, any thought that presupposes an assured future amounts to a mad gamble."],"Elias Hicks":["And yet you see the weakness of external evidence-and outward miracles; they were not sufficient to make true believers, or to make the Israelites believe that Jesus was their promised Messiah.","The fulness of the godhead dwelt in every blade of grass.","It was of the greatest moment, and consequence, that they should believe in him when he came, for they could receive no benefit from him without believing him to be their Messiah.","What encouragement the apostle holds out to us. O my friends, that we might leave all our pretensions, and come to the truth in our own hearts.","And if we are in this state, if we had an eternity of probation, what reason have we to suppose that we should profit by it - if we had ever so long a time to chose for ourselves we should pursue our own will, to gratify our carnal I desires.","We have met on a solemn occasion, and in this crowded assembly there is one thing that appears important, that is, for every one of us to be still, that if any thing should he said, every one may the better hear.","In reading the scriptures of truth, we often put wrong constructions upon them, and apply them improperly; and I apprehend it has often been the case in relation to this portion, particularly that part in relation to man's seeking out many inventions.","And so about many other things of the same nature, we are trying to make people believe these things, and we make creeds of them; and thus we continue to do our own will, which is the ground of all sin.","There was nothing then but the revelation of the spirit-of God that could make any of the Israelites understand and believe that he was their proper Messiah.","That I feel a desire, my friends, that we in this latter day of the world, in which light is fast spreading, that we should be willing to attend to those portions of the Scriptures of truth that direct us home to the foundation.","Just as a son, to be a son of man, must be of the same nature and spirit of his father; so with the sons of God, and so it will be with all who are born of the spirit of God.","We learn this by the precepts that Jesus left. He observed that the people were looking outward, and assured them that the kingdom of God cometh not with outward observation; and for this reason, that it was only to be known in man.","But if we continue in sin, and rebel and harden our hearts, we shall become so inured and fixed in it, that it will be natural, and we shall choose it from time to time.","You know that we have a great variety of ways to gratify our own desires.","Therefore, don't let sinners take courage to think they will be favoured like the thief on the cross; for we see on the other side, they may be like the hardened one, and reproach death itself.","O that our hearts were enlarged in love to God, that we might turn inward, to the blessed comforter, that the blessed Jesus said the Father would send.","Then, certainly, to be a Christian is to love God above all, and our neighbour as ourselves.","People talk about revelation, and say it has ceased; but what ignorance it bespeaks, when man knows not the least thing on earth without revelation.","I delight not in spreading any thing mysterious, for I consider it all lost time; but the things that all of us can see and know if we will.","To this light, then, would I recommend all, with mine own soul, - to this sure way of salvation."],"Elias James Corey":["To a synthetic chemist, the complex molecules of nature are as beautiful as any of her other creations. The perception of that beauty depends on the understanding of chemical structures and their transformations, and, as with a treasured work of art, deepens as the subject is studied, perhaps even to a level approaching romance.","Chemical synthesis is uniquely positioned at the heart of chemistry, the central science, and its impact on our lives and society is all pervasive.","Chemical compounds of carbon can exist in an infinite variety of compositions, forms and sizes. The naturally occurring organic substances are the basis of all life on Earth, and their science at the molecular level defines a fundamental language of that life.","My special fascination has been to understand better the world of chemistry and its complexities.","To the field of synthetic chemistry belongs an array of responsibilities which are crucial for the future of mankind, not only with regard to the health and needs of our society, but also for the attainment of a deep understanding of matter, chemical change, and life.","From the ages of five to twelve, I attended the Saint Laurence O'Toole elementary school in Lawrence, a city next to Methuen, and was taught by sisters of the Catholic order of Notre Dame de Namour. I enjoyed all my subjects there. I do not remember ever learning any science, except for mathematics.","My doctoral work was completed by the end of 1950 and, at the age of twenty-two, I joined the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign as an instructor in chemistry under the distinguished chemists Roger Adams and Carl S. Marvel.","By 1954, as an assistant professor with a group of three graduate students, I was able to initiate more complex experimental projects, dealing with the structure, stereochemistry and synthesis of natural products. As a result of the success of this research, I was appointed in 1956, at age twenty-seven, as professor of chemistry.","In the spring of 1959, I received an offer of a professorship at Harvard, which I accepted with alacrity since I wanted to be near my family and since the chemistry department at Harvard was unsurpassed.","It is fortunate that molecular synthesis also serves the utilitarian function of producing quantities of rare or novel substances which satisfy human needs, especially with regard to health, and the scientific function of stimulating research and education throughout the whole discipline of chemistry."],"Elias Koteas":["I can't stand to watch anything that I'm in. I tear it apart. The worst thing you can do is leave me alone and let me watch what I'm in. It's abusive.","Sometimes there are certain things that you gotta grow into. Sometimes, for some actors, they know it spiritually at a young age. Others need to grow into it.","I feel blessed. To live an artistic life, it's a blessing.","I know that I'm a quirky guy, to say the least. I don't know how easy I am to cast for a network. It hasn't been because I haven't tried. But am I dying to be on a TV show? No.","I don't know if it's a blessing or a curse, but every time I show up on set it still feels like the first time.","I play guys who are willing to go really far. If the dung really hits the fan, I don't know if I could walk the talk. But anyone who isn't willing to die for his convictions isn't worth living. My characters, no matter how demented they are, they have their convictions.","A lot of these roles that I feel like I've had some sort of impact, or that have had an effect on me, have always been with directors who have the time to somehow get to know me. Any good director's going to be curious about who it is that's coming aboard."],"Elie Ducommun":["War, we are told, shapes character; it resolves the major questions of international politics, consolidates nations, and indeed, constitutes the principal factor in the progress of civilization through its successive stages.","Wars, however frequent and destructive they may be, have never been able to kill entirely the intellectual and moral sense which raises man above the beast.","Let no one refer to the sword of Napoleon I as the instrument of progress and civilization!","I leave to the militarists the difficult task of trying to explain to us how these wars have served to shape character or to promote the progress of civilization or to achieve the reign of justice on earth. So far, they have not come forward with the explanation."],"Elie Metchnikoff":["It is often seen that in households where all members are exposed to the same danger, or again in schools or troops where everyone lives the same life, disease does not strike everyone indifferently.","Disease is not the prerogative of man and the domestic animals, so it was quite natural to see if the lower animals, with very simple organizations, showed pathological phenomena, and if so, infection, cure and immunity could be observed among them.","The adoration of human nature by the Greeks appeared in Greek plastic art and was the cause of its excellence.","Most of the centenarians whom I have been able to see have been so defective mentally that all that can be studied in them are the physical qualities and functions.","The old age of lower mammals presents characters similar to those found in man.","Whatever concerns health is of real public interest.","Inflammation as understood in man and the higher animals is a phenomenon that almost always results from the intervention of some pathogenic microbe.","Science, it is said, no doubt has ameliorated the material conditions of human life, but is powerless to solve those moral and philosophical questions that interest cultured people so deeply.","In the ancient world and, above all, among the Greeks, human nature was held in high esteem.","The Greek conception of a life in harmony with nature found its most complete development in the rationalism of the Renaissance and of the centuries that followed it.","It is, of course, quite natural that a biologist whose attention had been aroused by noticing in his own case the phenomena of precocious old age should turn to study the causes of it.","The appearance of aged persons is too well known to make detailed description necessary. The skin of the face is dry and wrinkled and generally pale. The hairs on the head and the body are white. The back is bent, and the gait is slow and laborious, whilst the memory is weak. Such are the most familiar traits of old age."],"Elie Saab":["I traced the path I walk today and my goals are many. I think that I'm achieving my goals.","My personality resembles my designs to a large extent. I'm in sync with myself and I'm transparent, just like my designs.","If I hadn't been a determined person I wouldn't have succeeded in life.","I liken myself to someone who built the house he will live in one day and is preparing to furnish it.","Worldwide is an overused word. But it's true that being known has given me new ideas and a chance to get to know new people who think in different ways. I want to hear myself referred to as Elie Saab, without labels or titles."],"Elie Tahari":["I worked in a boutique after work, my second job, selling women's clothes. And that was a way of not just making money but meeting women. That was very exciting job. I loved that job.","I had to succeed. Failure means I would have to be homeless again.","Financially I'm comfortable. But life has a lot more in store for me.","I don't walk around feeling like I'm successful. I feel like I did well.","If you like something, go for it."],"Elie Wiesel":["We must take sides. Neutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim. Silence encourages the tormentor, never the tormented.","Without memory, there is no culture. Without memory, there would be no civilization, no society, no future.","There may be times when we are powerless to prevent injustice, but there must never be a time when we fail to protest.","That I survived the Holocaust and went on to love beautiful girls, to talk, to write, to have toast and tea and live my life - that is what is abnormal.","No human race is superior; no religious faith is inferior. All collective judgments are wrong. Only racists make them.","Someone who hates one group will end up hating everyone - and, ultimately, hating himself or herself.","The opposite of love is not hate, it's indifference.","It all happened so fast. The ghetto. The deportation. The sealed cattle car. The fiery altar upon which the history of our people and the future of mankind were meant to be sacrificed.","A destruction, an annihilation that only man can provoke, only man can prevent.","When a person doesn't have gratitude, something is missing in his or her humanity.","Wherever men and women are persecuted because of their race, religion, or political views, that place must - at that moment - become the center of the universe.","In the concentration camps, we discovered this whole universe where everyone had his place. The killer came to kill, and the victims came to die.","Hope is like peace. It is not a gift from God. It is a gift only we can give one another.","Once you bring life into the world, you must protect it. We must protect it by changing the world.","I have not lost faith in God. I have moments of anger and protest. Sometimes I've been closer to him for that reason.","Mankind must remember that peace is not God's gift to his creatures; peace is our gift to each other.","When a person doesn't have gratitude, something is missing in his or her humanity. A person can almost be defined by his or her attitude toward gratitude.","Most people think that shadows follow, precede or surround beings or objects. The truth is that they also surround words, ideas, desires, deeds, impulses and memories.","I write to understand as much as to be understood.","Peace is our gift to each other.","I will say, with memoir, you must be honest. You must be truthful.","When I was young I lost everything.","I decided to devote my life to telling the story because I felt that having survived I owe something to the dead. and anyone who does not remember betrays them again.","For me, every hour is grace. And I feel gratitude in my heart each time I can meet someone and look at his or her smile.","There are victories of the soul and spirit. Sometimes, even if you lose, you win.","Indifference, to me, is the epitome of evil.","Because I remember, I despair. Because I remember, I have the duty to reject despair.","I marvel at the resilience of the Jewish people. Their best characteristic is their desire to remember. No other people has such an obsession with memory.","I remember, May 1944: I was 15-and-a-half, and I was thrown into a haunted universe where the story of the human adventure seemed to swing irrevocably between horror and malediction.","Religion is not man's relationship to God, it is man's relationship to man.","Our obligation is to give meaning to life and in doing so to overcome the passive, indifferent life.","It's clear to me that one can't be Jewish without Israel. Religious or non-religious, Zionist or non-Zionist, Ashkenazi or Sephardic - all these will not exist without Israel.","I never felt any attraction towards violence. I never tried to express myself through violence. Violence is a language.","After all, God is God because he remembers.","I was very, very religious. And of course I wrote about it in 'Night.' I questioned God's silence. So I questioned. I don't have an answer for that. Does it mean that I stopped having faith? No. I have faith, but I question it.","I've given my life to the principle and the ideal of memory, and remembrance.","Religion is a very personal thing for me. Religion has its good moments and its poor moments.","In any society, fanatics who hate don't hate only me - they hate you, too. They hate everybody.","I have to be self-conscious of what I'm trying to do with my life.","My greatest disappointment is that I believe that those of us who went through the war and tried to write about it, about their experience, became messengers. We have given the message, and nothing changed.","Sometimes I am asked if I know 'the response to Auschwitz; I answer that not only do I not know it, but that I don't even know if a tragedy of this magnitude has a response.","Friendship marks a life even more deeply than love. Love risks degenerating into obsession, friendship is never anything but sharing.","Because of indifference, one dies before one actually dies.","Just as despair can come to one only from other human beings, hope, too, can be given to one only by other human beings.","Not to transmit an experience is to betray it.","If I were in the government, I would persuade the prime minister to see the beauty in the fact that people see Israel as a haven - from their sadness to their hope.","Some stories are true that never happened.","It used to be said that when the Baal Shem Tov came into a town, his impact was so strong, he didn't have to speak. His disciples had to dance or to sing or to preach to have the same effect. I think a real messenger, myself or anyone, by the very fact that he is there as a person, as a symbol, could have the same impact.","Human beings should be held accountable. Leave God alone. He has enough problems.","When did I learn the Bible? When I was four or five years old. It's still the pull of my childhood, a fascination with the vanished world, and I can find everything except that world.","I would like to see real peace and a state of Israel living peacefully alongside a state of Palestine.","We have to go into the despair and go beyond it, by working and doing for somebody else, by using it for something else.","Words can sometimes, in moments of grace, attain the quality of deeds.","For in my tradition, as a Jew, I believe that whatever we receive we must share.","I'm a teacher and a writer; my life is words. When I see the denigration of language, it hurts me, and it's easy to denigrate a word by trivializing it.","I don't like docudramas. Documentaries should not go together with fiction, or half-fiction or quarter-fiction. The two should not go together. They cannot mix.","The Bible is not only laws, it's also stories.","Language failed me very often, but then, the substitute for me was silence, but not violence.","I never teach the same course twice.","In Jewish history there are no coincidences.","There is a difference between a book of two hundred pages from the very beginning, and a book of two hundred pages which is the result of an original eight hundred pages. The six hundred are there. Only you don't see them.","The Bible is not only laws, it's also stories. It begins, 'In the beginning God created Heaven.' If I had written these words, I wouldn't have written anything else; it's just enough.","Moses was the greatest legislator and the commander in chief of perhaps the first liberation army.","Historically, I come from Jewish history. I had the classic upbringing in the Yeshiva, learning, learning, and more learning.","For me, every hour is grace.","No one may speak for the dead, no one may interpret their mutilated dreams and visions.","I love teaching.","I do not recall a Jewish home without a book on the table.","What does mysticism really mean? It means the way to attain knowledge. It's close to philosophy, except in philosophy you go horizontally while in mysticism you go vertically.","In my tradition, one must wait until one has learned a lot of Bible and Talmud and the Prophets to handle mysticism. This isn't instant coffee. There is no instant mysticism.","I do not belong to this world. I continue to write everything in longhand. If I have to see something on the Internet, I ask my secretary or students. I am lucky, because I have people who do it for me.","Man, as long as he lives, is immortal. One minute before his death he shall be immortal. But one minute later, God wins.","When my father was born, it was part of the Austro-Hungarian empire. When I was born, it was Lithuania. When I left, it was Hungary. It is difficult to say where I come from.","Now, when I hear that Christians are getting together in order to defend the people of Israel, of course it brings joy to my heart. And it simply says, look, people have learned from history.","That is my major preoccupation, memory, the kingdom of memory. I want to protect and enrich that kingdom, glorify that kingdom and serve it.","When language fails, violence becomes a language; I never had that feeling.","I'll tell you what: I believe mysticism is a very serious endeavor. One must be equipped for it.","Look, if I were alone in the world, I would have the right to choose despair, solitude and self-fulfillment. But I am not alone.","I wanted to write a commentary on the Bible, to write about the Talmud, about celebration, about the great eternal subjects: love and happiness.","I don't know much about politics, and I don't want to know. That's why I rarely involve myself in politics.","If I were immersed in constant melancholy, I would not be who I am.","I believe in superstitions. You don't talk about a child who hasn't been born.","One always goes back to one's childhood in the beginning, and I come from a very religious family and surrounding. Very religious.","You would be amazed at the number of doors a Nobel Prize opens."],"Eliezer Yudkowsky":["By far, the greatest danger of Artificial Intelligence is that people conclude too early that they understand it.","Let the winds of evidence blow you about as though you are a leaf, with no direction of your own. Beware lest you fight a rearguard retreat against the evidence, grudgingly conceding each foot of ground only when forced, feeling cheated. Surrender to the truth as quickly as you can.","There's a popular concept of 'intelligence' as book smarts, like calculus or chess, as opposed to, say, social skills. So people say that 'it takes more than intelligence to succeed in human society.' But social skills reside in the brain, not the kidneys.","I wouldn't be surprised if tomorrow was the Final Dawn, the last sunrise before the Earth and Sun are reshaped into computing elements.","The purpose of a moral philosophy is not to look delightfully strange and counterintuitive or to provide employment to bioethicists. The purpose is to guide our choices toward life, health, beauty, happiness, fun, laughter, challenge, and learning.","A burning itch to know is higher than a solemn vow to pursue truth. To feel the burning itch of curiosity requires both that you be ignorant, and that you desire to relinquish your ignorance.","Intelligence is the source of technology. If we can use technology to improve intelligence, that closes the loop and potentially creates a positive feedback cycle.","I don't care where I live, so long as there's a roof to keep the rain off my books, and high-speed Internet access.","Anything that could give rise to smarter-than-human intelligence - in the form of Artificial Intelligence, brain-computer interfaces, or neuroscience-based human intelligence enhancement - wins hands down beyond contest as doing the most to change the world. Nothing else is even in the same league.","Nothing you'll read as breaking news will ever hold a candle to the sheer beauty of settled science. Textbook science has carefully phrased explanations for new students, math derived step by step, plenty of experiments as illustration, and test problems.","The systematic experimental study of reproducible errors of human reasoning, and what these errors reveal about underlying mental processes, is known as the heuristics and biases program in cognitive psychology. This program has made discoveries highly relevant to assessors of global catastrophic risks.","The human species was not born into a market economy. Bees won't sell you honey if you offer them an electronic funds transfer. The human species imagined money into existence, and it exists - for us, not mice or wasps - because we go on believing in it.","Do not flinch from experiences that might destroy your beliefs. The thought you cannot think controls you more than thoughts you speak aloud. Submit yourself to ordeals and test yourself in fire. Relinquish the emotion which rests upon a mistaken belief, and seek to feel fully that emotion which fits the facts.","You cannot 'rationalize' what is not rational to begin with - as if lying were called 'truthization.' There is no way to obtain more truth for a proposition by bribery, flattery, or the most passionate argument - you can make more people believe the proposition, but you cannot make it more true.","My successes already accomplished have mostly been taking existing science and getting people to apply it in their everyday lives.","To be clever in argument is not rationality but rationalization.","If our extinction proceeds slowly enough to allow a moment of horrified realization, the doers of the deed will likely be quite taken aback on realizing that they have actually destroyed the world. Therefore I suggest that if the Earth is destroyed, it will probably be by mistake.","The obvious choice isn't always the best choice, but sometimes, by golly, it is. I don't stop looking as soon I find an obvious answer, but if I go on looking, and the obvious-seeming answer still seems obvious, I don't feel guilty about keeping it.","A scientist worthy of a lab coat should be able to make original discoveries while wearing a clown suit, or give a lecture in a high squeaky voice from inhaling helium. It is written nowhere in the math of probability theory that one may have no fun.","The media thinks that only the cutting edge of science, the very latest controversies, are worth reporting on. How often do you see headlines like 'General Relativity still governing planetary orbits' or 'Phlogiston theory remains false'? By the time anything is solid science, it is no longer a breaking headline.","Textbook science is beautiful! Textbook science is comprehensible, unlike mere fascinating words that can never be truly beautiful. Elementary science textbooks describe simple theories, and simplicity is the core of scientific beauty. Fascinating words have no power, nor yet any meaning, without the math.","When something is universal enough in our everyday lives, we take it for granted to the point of forgetting it exists.","An anthropologist will not excitedly report of a newly discovered tribe: 'They eat food! They breathe air! They use tools! They tell each other stories!' We humans forget how alike we are, living in a world that only reminds us of our differences.","We tend to see individual differences instead of human universals. Thus, when someone says the word 'intelligence,' we think of Einstein instead of humans.","Since the rise of Homo sapiens, human beings have been the smartest minds around. But very shortly - on a historical scale, that is - we can expect technology to break the upper bound on intelligence that has held for the last few tens of thousands of years.","I am a full-time Research Fellow at the Machine Intelligence Research Institute, a small 501(c)(3) public charity supported primarily by individual donations.","My parents were early adopters, and I've been online since a rather young age. You should regard anything from 2001 or earlier as having been written by a different person who also happens to be named 'Eliezer Yudkowsky.' I do not share his opinions.","Though I have friends aplenty in academia, I don't operate within the academic system myself.","In our skulls, we carry around 3 pounds of slimy, wet, greyish tissue, corrugated like crumpled toilet paper. You wouldn't think, to look at the unappetizing lump, that it was some of the most powerful stuff in the known universe.","I keep trying to explain to people that the archetype of intelligence is not Dustin Hoffman in 'The Rain Man;' it is a human being, period. It is squishy things that explode in a vacuum, leaving footprints on their moon.","When you think of intelligence, don't think of a college professor; think of human beings as opposed to chimpanzees. If you don't have human intelligence, you're not even in the game.","The purest case of an intelligence explosion would be an Artificial Intelligence rewriting its own source code. The key idea is that if you can improve intelligence even a little, the process accelerates. It's a tipping point. Like trying to balance a pen on one end - as soon as it tilts even a little, it quickly falls the rest of the way.","Transhumanists are not fond of death. We would stop it if we could. To this end, we support research that holds out hope of a future in which humanity has defeated death.","If I could create a world where people lived forever, or at the very least a few billion years, I would do so. I don't think humanity will always be stuck in the awkward stage we now occupy, when we are smart enough to create enormous problems for ourselves, but not quite smart enough to solve them.","If you want to maximize your expected utility, you try to save the world and the future of intergalactic civilization instead of donating your money to the society for curing rare diseases and cute puppies.","I want to carry in my heart forever the key word of the Olympics - 'passion.'"],"Elif Batuman":["When I was growing up, many of my relatives had never seen a black person before. Today, hundreds, maybe thousands of Africans live in Istanbul's old city alone. It's hard to imagine their lives in their human totality.","Anyone who has ever tried to plot a detective mystery knows that the hardest thing to come up with is motive.","I like to think that I know a lot of words, but I definitely don't know all of them.","For a Nabokov fan, paging through 'Fine Lines,' which includes a critical introduction and several essayistic evaluations of Nabokov's scientific oeuvre, can feel a bit like reading the second half of 'Pale Fire': one is confronted by a content-rich, almost dementedly tangential commentary on an increasingly inscrutable work.","Reading Epictetus, I realized that most of the pain in my life came not from any actual privations or insults but, rather, from the shame of thinking that they could have been avoided.","When I read that nobody should ever feel ashamed to be alone or to be in a crowd, I realized that I often felt ashamed of both of those things.","Read enough about the dung beetle, and a picture of its character emerges: patient, optimistic, uncomplaining.","For much of my adult life, I believed, inaccurately, that I knew the story of Charles Dickens's 'A Christmas Carol' - that I remembered it from childhood.","At the beginning of 'A Christmas Carol,' Scrooge embodies one of the central tenets of depression: that one has always been this way - and always will be.","My parents were born into a secular country. They met in Turkey's top medical school, moved to America in the nineteen-seventies, and became researchers and professors.","I grew up hearing that if it hadn't been for Ataturk, my grandmother would have been 'a covered person' who would have been reliant on a man for her livelihood. Instead, she went to boarding school, wrote a thesis on Balzac, and became a teacher.","I felt grateful to Ataturk that my parents were so well educated, that they weren't held back by superstition or religion, that they were true scientists who taught me how to read when I was three and never doubted that I could become a writer.","I have always known my mother as an agnostic, less certain than my father that the universe hadn't been created by some great intelligence. But she would get even more annoyed than my father did when she thought that people were invoking God to do their jobs for them - for example, when she saw a bus with a sticker saying 'Allah Protect Us.'","If, for a moment, it seemed that September 11th could be identified with Iraq, the illusion was short-lived.","Awkwardness is the consciousness of a false position.","'Awkward' implies both solidarity and implication. Nobody is exempt.","Awkwardness comes from the realization that, when you look around the world, it's difficult to identify anyone who isn't either the victim or the beneficiary of injustice.","'Gone Girl' is as much about the near impossibility of being a good husband as it is about the anguish of being a good wife.","It's possible to watch 'Gone Girl' and feel that you have seen something terribly bleak. But it's also possible to receive it as good news. Any powerful articulation of the need for change is also a testimony to the possibility of change.","Listing and counting have a spooky, magical power, and the holiday season is a spooky, magical time.","Why is there an end of the year? Because the calendar imposes numerical order on time. There is a natural fitness in the celebration of the New Year, a holiday of numbers imposed on things, with lists, as well as with Advent calendars and songs like 'The Twelve Days of Christmas.'","Lists are based on realism - on the coldly contemplated finitude of resources.","Most Americans have probably heard the song 'Santa Claus Is Coming to Town' about a billion times in the supermarket alone.","The first time I held an African drum in my hands was at Koc University in a forest in the northern suburbs of Istanbul.","Every time a meteor comes close to the earth, we all think about the end of the world - but our internal soundtrack doesn't turn off. We're also thinking about pizza or passing a slow tractor or making a turn, and for a magical instant, our lives seem to be in conversation with the stars.","I grew up thinking that it was immoral to idealize the past because, in the past, there was slavery and no penicillin.","The Himalayan glaciers, China's trade surplus, Olympic ice hockey - the world is full of pressing subjects that people never consult me about.","Tolstoy didn't know about steampunk or cyborgs, but he did know about the nightmarishness of steam power, unruly machines, and the creepy half-human status of the Russian peasant classes. In 'Anna Karenina,' nineteenth-century life itself is a relentless, relentlessly modern machine, flattening those who oppose it.","I enjoy a good meal as much as anyone, but I get so confused by nutritional, budgetary, ecological, ethical, aesthetic, and time-management concerns that I often subsist for weeks on instant oatmeal and multivitamins.","Soccer is taken extremely seriously in Turkey.","'Constructed Worlds' comes from a novel draft that I wrote in my early twenties and reread/revised only in my late thirties.","There's a lot to be said for an American-style liberal-arts education, which prevents young people from professionalizing right away.","My parents were educated in the Turkish system and went straight from high school to medical school; my mom, who had skipped a grade, was dissecting corpses at age seventeen. Growing up in America, I think I envied my parents' education. By comparison, everything I did in school seemed so sort of low-stakes and infantilizing.","I like a novel to have a certain amount of dead time and filler - unremarkable scenery, descriptions of getting from point A to point B, dialogue in which not much is said - in between the parts that are electric. With a long work that you don't read in one sitting, I think that makes for the best reading experience.","I had wanted to write 'The Possessed' as fiction, but everyone told me that no one would read a novel about graduate students. It seems almost uncivilized to tell someone writing a novel, 'No, you have to call this a memoir.'","One of the stories that really impressed me was 'Anna Karenina.' As a novel, that made an impression on me, showing me what the novel can do.","I love the novelist's freedom of going into different people's subjectivity and being able to work with them as characters.","I'm Turkish-American; I was a freshman at Harvard in 1995 and 96. I did teach English in Hungary in the summer of 1996. I'm an autobiographical writer in the sense that whether in fiction or nonfiction, the issues and relationships and phenomena and problems I'm most interested in exploring are the ones I've experienced personally.","Many books have changed my life, but only one has the word 'life-changing' in the title: Marie Kondo's 'The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying.'","Proust's 'In Search of Lost Time,' especially 'Time Regained,' made me think differently about what the novel is and can do. Then I forgot about it, then reread it and remembered again.","I actually really wish I had written 'The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying' as an unreliably narrated novel that is also a self-help book.","I don't believe in being ashamed about not having read things.","No time you spend writing will be wasted - even if you write something that's bad.","Everyone has a certain amount of bad writing to get out of their system.","It's important not to censor yourself and not to get upset or demoralized when you write bad stuff.","The one text that most changed my opinion on criticism was probably Freud's 'Interpretation of Dreams,' which I read in college.","The first modern novel was already a product, even an expression, of negative criticism: 'Don Quixote' contains a quite explicit critique of the chivalric romance and its insufficiency to account for the way real life feels when you get up in the morning in 17th-century Spain.","Much as there are things about our own life stories that we can learn only from the systematic study of our dreams, there are things about the human condition that we can learn only from a systematic study of literature.","I always wanted to write novels, even before I had read a lot of novels or had a very good idea of what they were.","The novel is like a melancholy form. It's about some kind of disillusionment with the way things are versus the idea of how they could be or how they used to be.","The problems in the Russian novel are quite similar to the problems of Turkish nationalism and Turkish culture, which was something that I grew up thinking didn't affect me very much because my parents didn't really talk about it.","Even in novels where the love relationship isn't the focus, I feel like it's often there, and the background is some barometer of whether this is a happy or sad story or whether this is a successful or unsuccessful life.","When in doubt, it is better to do the less conservative thing and to err on the side of the more colorful, possibly terrible mistake. That comes from thinking of yourself as a writer.","If you are in a breakup, you might as well go all the way and spend the summer in Samarkand, with no air-conditioning, learning a language you have no use for. At least it adds some romance to a depressing situation.","By the time I got to college, the Cold War was basically over.","A lot of fiction doesn't answer a question that any reasonable person would ever ask.","Russian literature got me interested in what literature means.","The book that made me decide to go into Russian literature was 'Anna Karenina,' which I first read in high school. The thing that appealed to me and constituted its Russianness for me was that it was simultaneously incredibly funny and sad.","I've developed this love of trashy Russian literature. There's a women's detective series that I was obsessed with for a while, written by Aleksandra Marinina, the former chief of police.","The dominant question for us with regard to literature has become, 'What does this have to do with me, with life as I know it?' That's the question answered by all these books about how Proust was actually a neuroscientist or how Proust can teach you emotional intelligence.","Imagination is really dependent on memory and observation, these things that we think of as part of nonfiction writing, actually.","You can't invent something you have no epistemological access to. In a way, it's all recombination.","There are very few things that I have any patience for that are not at least a little bit humorous.","It's kind of an embarrassing story - that's why it's called 'The Idiot.' But looking back at your past self, you see that this person had reasons for everything she did. There's a whole lot of awkwardness, but really, what should one be embarrassed about?","It's so embarrassing and painful to be young.","People don't become writers because they love having spontaneous, real-world interactions with living people as bodies with clothes in time.","There is this way that I felt when I was younger that we were beyond history and we were all citizens of the world that now seems so naive.","When you walk around, you have all this stuff rattling around in your head, things that have happened to you, things you have read. Life is just life, and you get what you get out of it.","When you started looking at the life of Tolstoy, there was so much passion and anger and drama surrounding him.","To think of Tolstoy eating a sandwich is intrinsically kind of funny.","You base your actions on a projected ending, which you actually don't know. However, when you reach the crucial point, and the pinnacle event doesn't occur, you just need to go on, and something else will happen.","There's this idea that if you want to write, you shouldn't study literature because then you're dissecting what you love, and you should keep your love of literature pure. I think that's kind of silly.","I find something very appealing about taking literature very literally.","There's definitely a culture of Russian literature in Turkey. And in the U.S. too, to an extent - especially Dostoevsky.","Even when I was very small, my mother treated me like a great novelist. She was like: 'Oh, I'm sitting at the breakfast table with Flaubert,' and would say, if she burned some food or was late arriving, 'Don't put this in your novel!'","As a novelist, you write about social mores, but not everything can be explained.","Being in a heterosexual relationship for a woman is always implicitly a little bit humiliating.","A lot of what I write is very personal.","My family is not only not religious, but my parents are both - they're secularists. My father is actually an atheist and feels very strongly about it.","My family is very feminist, and they consider that Islam is not a super feminist religion, which I know people can argue about. But that's - anyway that's how I was brought up, so it would be odd for me to suddenly just up and start wearing a headscarf.","I think it is true that when we're older, we realize the way that people act is... you know, everyone's kind of talking off the cuff, and everyone's, you know, spitballing sometimes.","Actually, I've taught creative writing in Turkey, at an English language university, where the students were native Turkish speakers, but they were writing their essays in English, and they were very interesting - even the sense of structure, the conventions of writing, the different styles of writing.","From an early age, my favorite thing to read was novels. For years, when I was writing only nonfiction, still I was reading almost exclusively novels. It's weird to be producing something that you don't consume. It feels really alienating.","The first thing I tried to write was a novel, when I took that time off in grad school. Then I didn't finish it. I went back to school, and then I started writing nonfiction kind of by accident.","One of the most painful parts of a breakup is having the feeling that your life is a story, and then the other person leaves and takes the story with them. And you're left there without it. You're left in this version of life that's basically a succession of events and interactions that don't seem to be going anywhere.","I do think of 'The Idiot,' in a way, as a self-standing book about a certain struggle to make meaning, the struggle for a girl to find meaning outside of the romance plot."],"Elif Safak":["I love commuting between languages just like I love commuting between cultures and cities.","I write with humour about sadness, to introduce an element of sweet to the sour, a bit like Turkish food.","Books change us. Books save us. I know this because it happened to me. Books saved me. So, I do believe through stories we can learn to change, we can learn to empathize and be more connected with the universe and with humanity.","I spent my entire childhood observing people. I still do.","I find families intriguing, perhaps because I did not grow up in one. I was raised by a feminist, independent, single mother, a divorcee.","I write as if I were drunk. It is a process of intuition rather than placing myself above my story like a puppeteer pulling strings. For me, it's a scary, chaotic process over which I have little control. Words demand other words, characters resist me.","God is the biggest storyteller, and when we create stories, we connect with him and with each other across cultural, religious and gender boundaries.","For me, writing stories is one way of feeling connected to the universe and God."],"Elihu Root":["The wolf always charges the lamb with muddying the stream.","Human nature must have come much nearer perfection than it is now, or will be in many generations, to exclude from such a control prejudice, selfishness, ambition, and injustice.","The attractive idea that we can now have a parliament of man with authority to control the conduct of nations by legislation or an international police force with power to enforce national conformity to rules of right conduct is a counsel of perfection.","Human life is held in much higher esteem, and the taking of it, whether in private quarrel or by judicial procedure, is looked upon much more seriously than it was formerly.","Nothing is more important in the preservation of peace than to secure among the great mass of the people living under constitutional government a just conception of the rights which their nation has against others and of the duties their nation owes to others.","Secretary of War Stanton used to get out of patience with Lincoln because he was all the time pardoning men who ought to be shot.","Claims of right and insistence upon obligations may depend upon treaty stipulations, or upon the rules of international law, or upon the sense of natural justice applied to the circumstances of a particular case, or upon disputed facts.","Gradually, everything that happens in the world is coming to be of interest everywhere in the world, and, gradually, thoughtful men and women everywhere are sitting in judgment upon the conduct of all nations.","Honest people, mistakenly believing in the justice of their cause, are led to support injustice.","Cruelty to men and to the lower animals as well, which would have passed unnoticed a century ago, now shocks the sensibilities and is regarded as wicked and degrading.","In the first place, when there is a policy of intentional aggression, inspired by a desire to get possession of the territory or the trade of another country, right or wrong, a pretext is always sought.","It is not uncommon in modern times to see governments straining every nerve to keep the peace, and the people whom they represent, with patriotic enthusiasm and resentment over real or fancied wrongs, urging them forward to war.","It is to be observed that every case of war averted is a gain in general, for it helps to form a habit of peace, and community habits long continued become standards of conduct.","No nation now sets forth to despoil another upon the avowed ground that it desires the spoils.","Nobody knows through how many thousands of years fighting men have made a place for themselves while the weak and peaceable have gone to the wall.","Prejudice and passion and suspicion are more dangerous than the incitement of self-interest or the most stubborn adherence to real differences of opinion regarding rights.","The growth of modern constitutional government compels for its successful practice the exercise of reason and considerate judgment by the individual citizens who constitute the electorate.","The law of the survival of the fittest led inevitably to the survival and predominance of the men who were effective in war and who loved it because they were effective.","The limitation upon this mode of promoting peace lies in the fact that it consists in an appeal to the civilized side of man, while war is the product of forces proceeding from man's original savage nature.","The line of least resistance in the progress of civilization is to make that theoretical postulate real by the continually increasing force of the world's public opinion.","The mere assemblage of peace loving people to interchange convincing reasons for their common faith, mere exhortation and argument to the public in favor of peace in general fall short of the mark.","The methods of peace propaganda which aim at establishing peace doctrine by argument and by creating a feeling favorable to peace in general seem to fall short of reaching the springs of human action and of dealing with the causes of the conduct which they seek to modify.","The point of departure of the process to which we wish to contribute is the fact that war is the natural reaction of human nature in the savage state, while peace is the result of acquired characteristics.","The popular tendency is to listen approvingly to the most extreme statements and claims of politicians and orators who seek popularity by declaring their own country right in everything and other countries wrong in everything.","The theoretical postulate of all diplomatic discussion between nations is the assumed willingness of every nation to do justice.","There is so much of good in human nature that men grow to like each other upon better acquaintance, and this points to another way in which we may strive to promote the peace of the world.","War was forced upon mankind in his original civil and social condition.","To deal with the true causes of war one must begin by recognizing as of prime relevancy to the solution of the problem the familiar fact that civilization is a partial, incomplete, and, to a great extent, superficial modification of barbarism.","Men do not fail; they give up trying."],"Elijah Cummings":["Americans of our own time - minority and majority Americans alike - need the continued guidance that the Voting Rights Act provides. We have come a long way, but more needs to be done.","By providing students in our Nation with such an education, we help save our children from the clutches of poverty, crime, drugs, and hopelessness, and we help safeguard our Nation's prosperity for generations yet unborn.","More than 26,000 lives may be lost to the effects of drug abuse this year. This tragic impact is felt in communities across this great nation. Sadly many of these deaths occur among our young people.","Typically diagnosed during childhood and adolescent years, juvenile diabetes, also referred to as Type I diabetes, currently affects more than 3 million Americans and more then 13,000 children are diagnosed each year.","It was to carry the American democratic journey beyond these failings that Black citizens and civil rights workers risked unemployment, violence and death.","The U.S. Census Bureau acknowledged this fact when it reported that those with a bachelor's degree earn on average $1 million more over their lifetime than those with only a high school diploma.","In the same vein as these events, National Minority Health Month also serves as a reminder of how much work needs to be done to eliminate health and healthcare inequities.","African-American women account for 67 percent of all newly diagnosed female AIDS cases."],"Elijah Kelley":["When I graduated from high school, my mom and dad were saying I needed to go to college, but I said I wanted to pursue my dream of acting. At the end of my high school career, they quit their jobs, and we moved out to California on a leap of faith.","My dream role? I think to play Sammy Davis Jr. and his life story.","I'm an actor. I'm a singer. And I dance. To be able to do all these things is amazing. And to have similar-minded people all around you, doing what you love, is even more amazing.","Growing up in Georgia, it was sort of the last place to jump on the bandwagon of the integrated frontier. I have aunts and uncles and grandparents that experienced the 'whites only' and segregated schools.","I can move, but I've never background-danced for anybody.","John Travolta, I don't think anybody would not jump at a chance to work with a guy like him because he's gone from 'Grease' to 'Face Off' to, he's gonna do 'Dallas.' I mean, he's so great in his range, and he's truly a legend and a pro in our time.","I'd love to do Broadway. It's funny. I love it, but I've never actually seen an actual Broadway show, not even 'Hairspray.'","I saw 'Hairspray' at the Pantages in L.A. It came to the Pantages right before I did the movie, and just being in New York sometimes and seeing the marquees and everything like that, I'm like, 'I really, really have to go experience a Broadway play.'","I grew up singing in church. I've been doing that since I was 3 years old. Singing was a blessing for me to do.","I want to be known as a triple threat. I have aspirations to win an Oscar and a Grammy, and I also want to win a Tony. I want to be one of those guys like Frank Sinatra or Sammy Davis Jr. that crossed all those barriers of entertainment.","'Party Up' is like 'Ferris Bueller's Day Off' crossed with 'House Party.' It's basically about this kid, my character, who's this smooth, intelligent kid who's petitioning to throw this big end-of-the-year-bash house party, and so he goes and manipulating different people and ruining lives. He somewhat has a selfish heart, but he's a nice guy.","I grew up in a really small town: LaGrange, Georgia. There weren't a lot of creative outlets there, so I did local castings.","Doing an animation is nothing like anything you could ever experience. You get to be a kid again and just play dress up in a movie studio.","I can dance - I can dance a little bit. I can move. I don't - I'm not a - I don't proclaim to be a dancer, but I can move. But instruments, playing the drums, I probably play the drums better than I walk, better than I do anything.","I used to watch people like Raven-Symone and, you know, the Olsens at a young age, and Will Smith and people like that, and just looking at them at a young age on TV. And just thinking to myself, 'I can do that,' and questioning why I wasn't there.","The biggest difference between L.A. and my hometown in Georgia is when Georgia goes to sleep, L.A. wakes up. So, like, in LaGrange, when people are going to sleep at 10, 11 to get up in the morning, we're just getting dressed to go out.","I used to set out and do a film and say, 'This is going to be the biggest film I've ever done.' But that's not the right approach. The approach should be the work.","I have a growing resume, but it's because I'm very selective. There are a lot of actors in my position that are like me: they have an opportunity to make a lot of money early in their career, and they do that, and after that, there's nothing to sustain that. There's no art or interest in your craft from the people that want to see you.","I did everything in high school - I played tennis, I played basketball, I was in chorus, I was in the band, I even did the mascot senior year... I went to the football games, and at half-time I went across the field, met all the cheerleaders and got their numbers! The same year, I won prom king!"],"Elijah Parish Lovejoy":["The cry of the oppressed has entered not only into my ears, but into my soul, so that while I live, I cannot hold my peace.","As long as I am an American citizen, and as long as American blood runs in these veins, I shall hold myself at liberty to speak, to write, and to publish whatever I please on any subject, being amenable to the laws of my country for the same.","Abolitionists believe that, as all men are born free, so all who are now held as slaves in this country were born free, and that they are slaves now is the sin, not of those who introduced the race into this country, but of those, and those alone, who now hold them and have held them in slavery from their birth.","While I value the good opinion of my fellow citizens as highly as anyone, I may be permitted to say that I am governed by higher considerations than either the favor or the fear of man. I am impelled to the course I have taken because I fear God.","I have sworn eternal opposition to slavery, and by the blessing of God, I will never go back.","Truth is eternal, unchanging, though circumstances may and do operate to give a different colour to it, in our view, at different times. And truth will prevail, and those who do not yield to it must be destroyed by it.","I was, by divine grace, enabled to bring all my sins and all my sorrows and lay them at the feet of Jesus, and to receive the blessed assurance that He had accepted me, all sinful and polluted as I was.","Emancipation - what is meant by it? Simply that the slaves shall cease to be held as property and shall henceforth be held and treated as human beings. Simply, that we should take our feet from off their necks.","I most earnestly advise you, again and again, love, honor, and obey your parents. Friends like them, you need not expect to find in this world.","Nothing but a miracle of sovereign mercy could have arrested and saved me from eternal perdition. How I could have so long resisted the entreaties, the prayers, and the tears of my dear parents, and the influences of the Holy Spirit, is, to me, a wonder entirely incomprehensible.","If I know my own heart, I do now feel the necessity of resigning myself into the hands of my God, to mould and guide me at His will; tho I dare not say that I am, at present, willing to do it.","It is not possible that one man can convert another into a piece of property, thus at once annihilating all his personal rights, without the most flagrant injustice and usurpation.","I have concluded, after consultation with my friends and earnestly seeking counsel of God, to remain at Alton, and here to insist on protection in the exercise of my rights.","Is he not a God that showeth mercy and keepeth covenant? Of all sins, it seems to me that the sin of unbelief is the most dishonouring to God.","The eternal God - the infinite Jehovah - has done all he could do - even to the sacrificing his own Son - to provide a way for man's happiness, and yet they reject him, hate him, and laugh him to scorn!","Emancipation, to be of any value to the slave, must be the free, voluntary act of the master, performed from a conviction of its propriety.","Fortune has, in the main, hitherto looked unfavourably upon me since I left home, but I begin to hope for better things. Still, in all my past distresses, one thought has consoled me - I have learned to appreciate a parent's love.","It seems to me scarcely possible that one who has so long lived in sin, who has resisted so much light and has so often grieved away the Holy Spirit, as I have, should again be visited with its heavenly influences. But I hope it is so.","It is the easiest thing in the world to become a Christian - ten thousand times easier than it is to hold out unrepenting against the motives which God presents to the mind, to induce it to forsake its evil thoughts and turn unto Him.","I am sure I ought not to be, but I have great reason to tremble lest Satan and my own wicked heart get the better of me. It is no easy matter to fight such enemies as these, but with Christ strengthening me, I know I shall come off more than a conquerer.","I cannot surrender my principles, though the whole world besides should vote them down - I can make no compromise between truth and error, even though my life be the alternative.","I have appealed to the constitution and laws of my country; if they fail to protect me, I appeal to God, and with Him I cheerfully rest my cause. I can die at my post, but I cannot desert it.","If I am not safe in Alton, I shall not be safe anywhere.","If the civil authorities refuse to protect me, I must look to God, and if I die, I have determined to make my grave in Alton.","The very flag of freedom that waves over our heads is formed from material cultivated by slaves, on soil moistened with their blood drawn from them by the whip of a republican taskmaster!","As the Bible inculcates upon man but one duty in respect to sin, and that is immediate repentance, abolitionists believe that all who hold slaves, or who approve the practice in others, should immediately cease to do so.","I know that I have the right freely to speak and publish my sentiments, subject only to the laws of the land for the abuse of that right.","If I have been guilty of no violation of law, why am I hunted up and down continually like a partridge upon the mountains? Why am I threatened with the tar barrel? Why am I waylaid every day, and from night to night, and my life in jeopardy every hour?","I have been beset night and day at Alton. And now, if I leave here and go elsewhere, violence may overtake me in my retreat, and I have no more claim upon the protection of any other community than I have upon this."],"Elijah Wood":["There's a real purity in New Zealand that doesn't exist in the states. It's actually not an easy thing to find in our world anymore. It's a unique place because it is so far away from the rest of the world. There is a sense of isolation and also being protected.","I definitely don't look my age. So I actively look for roles that will help people change their perception of me.","Dream the impossible because dreams do come true.","I think being different, going against the grain of society is the greatest thing in the world.","In the absence of love, there is nothing worth fighting for.","I had a woman breakdown and cry when she met me which was difficult to deal with because immediately when someone starts to cry, you want to comfort them, you know, 'Poor thing.'

I tried to make her feel better.","The worst kind of lying I've ever done is keeping things from people.","I'm kind of insane when it comes to music, a little obsessed.","If you cut off your arm instead of going 'spurt, spurt, spurt' wouldn't it, like, go nuts? Or would it go with the beat of your heart?","So much time is wasted on trying to be better than others."],"Elin Hilderbrand":["For graduate school I ended up going to the University of Iowa, which is, of course, the best graduate writing program in the country.","I am a summer person.","Iowa City is okay as Midwestern cities go, but there's no food, no culture, no ocean."],"Elin Nordegren":["I have confidence in my beliefs, my decisions, and myself.","Forgiveness takes time. It is the last step of the grieving process.","Money can't buy happiness. Or put my family back together.","I believe in love because I've seen it. I've been there.","I know how fortunate I am.","I grew up with great relationships with my stepparents.","In general, in any kind of stepparent relationship, I'm happy that there's somebody else loving my children.","My relationship with Tiger is centered around our children, and we are doing really good - we really are - and I am so happy that is the case. He is a great father."],"Elinor Glyn":["All the legislation in the world will not abolish kissing.","American husbands are the best in the world; no other husbands are so generous to their wives, or can be so easily divorced.","Everything that I write will be signed with my name.","I have wondered sometimes if there are not perhaps some disadvantages in having really blue blood in one's veins, like grandmamma and me."],"Elinor Lipman":["I was nearly fired from my second job, which was writing press releases for Boston's public television station.","Five hundred words a day is what I aim for. And I don't go on to the next chapter until I've polished and polished and polished the one I'm working on.","An early editor characterized my books as 'romantic comedy for intelligent adults.' I think people see them as funny but kind. I don't set out to write either funny or kind, but it's a voice they like, quirky like me... And you know, people like happy endings.","My narrators tend to be women with low self-esteem, so I can send them to charm school.","I wear a pedometer, aiming for five miles a day - don't be too impressed; that includes walking around my house and food shopping.","I watch golf on television, although I don't golf - except for visits to the driving range in spurts.","I was a roving guard on the Lowell Hebrew Community Center's girls' basketball team all through high school. My specialty was stealing the ball, but my only shot was a lay-up."],"Elinor Ostrom":["Bureaucrats sometimes do not have the correct information, while citizens and users of resources do.","What we have ignored is what citizens can do and the importance of real involvement of the people involved - versus just having somebody in Washington make a rule.","What we have ignored is what citizens can do and the importance of real involvement of the people versus just having somebody in Washington make a rule."],"Elinor Smith":["It had long since come to my attention that people of accomplishment rarely sat back and let things happen to them. They went out and happened to things."],"Elinor Wylie":["In masks outrageous and austere, The years go by in single file; But none has merited my fear, And none has quite escaped my smile.","I am better able to imagine hell than heaven; it is my inheritance, I suppose.","If any have a stone to throw It is not I, ever or now."],"Elio Di Rupo":["My life is a fairy tale. You could not make it up.","Being the chief minister of a regional government is just a pastime compared with the hellish job of being prime minister of two different communities brought together."],"Eliot Engel":["Yet, nearly 6 decades after the Holocaust concluded, Anti-Semitism still exists as the scourge of the world.","The only plan the Administration seems to have for winning the war is that there is no plan and no schedule for our troops to come home and get out of harm's way.","All Americans owe a debt of gratitude to Dr. King for his bravery and commitment to civil rights and nonviolence that changed this nation - and world - for the better.","I do not think we should be trying to save our freedom by killing the safeguards that keep our liberties.","The free nations of the world will not be pushed around by terrorist cowards whose goal is to spread fear and destruction and destroy our liberty and way of life.","The countless number of influential figures in American history who are of Caribbean heritage indicates the need to set aside a designated time to celebrate their contribution to our country.","While Haiti has recently celebrated more than 200 years of independence from French colonial rule, the citizens of the island remain vulnerable to poverty, poor health, and political chaos.","We all would like to see a brighter future for Haiti, and I hope this conference will serve to explore many views. Respect for human rights, freedom, and the rule of law must be established in the poorest nation in our hemisphere.","I wholeheartedly support umbilical stem cell research, but also support embryonic stem cell research.","Scientists have stated that embryonic stem cells provide the best opportunity for devising unique treatments of these serious diseases since, unlike adult stem cells, they may be induced to develop into any type of cell.","Adult stem cells are also problematic, as they are difficult to identify, purify and grow, and simply may not exist for certain diseased tissues that need to be replaced.","A middle class is so important to a society that its value cannot be overestimated.","On the eve of World War I, an estimated two million Armenians lived in the Ottoman Empire. Well over a million were deported and hundreds of thousands were simply killed.","The Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act expires at the end of this year. Thus, we must act quickly to ensure our constituents continue to receive the services they enjoy.","We stand with the people of Taiwan and their democratic ways, and I am proud to be a part of reaffirming the unwavering commitment to the Taiwan Relations Act by the United States Congress.","The freedom of thought and expression is one of the most sacred rights in this country.","Preventing terrorist attacks is of the highest important, but trashing the Constitution is not the right way to do it.","Too small is our world to allow discrimination, bigotry and intolerance to thrive in any corner of it, let alone in the United States of America.","I believe that ultimately the situation in Kosovo can only be resolved through self-determination.","I very much regret that our administration has pushed the whole issue of Kosovo to the back burner.","It is my hope that as we commemorate Black History Month in the future, we will continue to celebrate the many achievements and rich culture of African-Americans.","I represent a district covering Rockland, Westchester and Bronx counties, all of which are part of the 9 million people that this water is so important for."],"Eliot Ness":["You think, eventually, that nothing can disturb you and that your nerves are impregnable. Yet, looking down at that familiar face, I realized that death is something to which we never become calloused.","Doubts raced through my mind as I considered the feasibility of enforcing a law which the majority of honest citizens didn't seem to want.","Unquestionably, it was going to be highly dangerous. Yet I felt it was quite natural to jump at the task. After all, if you don't like action and excitement, you don't go into police work. And, what the hell, I figured, nobody lives forever!"],"Eliot Schrefer":["As someone who attended six different public schools across America, went to Harvard, and subsequently became a tutor in Manhattan's affluent Upper East Side, I've witnessed firsthand the differences in learning styles between public school educations and private.","I remember my guidance counselor, when I told her I wanted to apply to Harvard, she paused and said, 'That's in New York, right?' The funny thing is, I didn't really know. It was a few weeks before I was like, 'No, I think it's in Massachusetts.'","With few exceptions, the publishing industry has come to a consensus: if a book has a young protagonist, and if its worldview is primarily interested in the questions that crop up when coming of age, then it's a young adult novel.","Higher SAT scores mean better college matriculation rates. So it's no wonder that private schools in ultra-competitive environments would grease the qualifying process as much as possible.","You are literally never alone. While there are roughly 6.7 billion people on Earth, you may not feel that many of them at all care very much about your existence. But within your colon alone are living at least 1012 billion organisms, or roughly a thousand times the number of people on the planet. Stop your metabolic processes, and you stop theirs.","The fact is that the College Board's products - the SAT, other standardized tests, the accompanying strategy guides - are sold at far higher than the cost to make them.","Elite private-school educations leave students unprepared for a standardized test with which their public school counterparts are innately familiar.","What SAT tutoring does is it invisibly alters the admissions pool so a school could try to be as egalitarian as they can, but if a student is SAT-tutored, and their score goes up 200 points in a year, and the college admissions committee has no idea that the student got tutored, all of a sudden it's shifting the pool back toward old money.","The elite private tutor is typically ivy-educated and falls into one of two categories - a twenty-something pursuing an artistic career on the side, or someone older who has made a career out of college-prep. They are presentable, well-spoken, and are treated by doormen as guests more than as employees.","In my business - SAT tutoring - you get used to sighs. A client's mother frets over the sheer amount of work her daughter has to do to get her score up, until she reaches the resigned moment when she will sigh and observe that no one thought you could prepare for the SAT back when she took it - it was 'untutorable.'","At Horace Mann High School in affluent Riverdale, New York, one of the top schools in the country, those who receive double time on tests are plentiful enough to qualify as their own segment of the student body. Known to their peers as 2Ts, they participate in the same activities, get the same grades, and attend the same range of colleges.","Line up a group of Horace Mann students, interview them, and take a look at their resumes, and you'll be hard pressed to pick out the students who require extra time. So then, what qualifies these students to receive special accommodations on the SAT?","When I was a teenager, what I most wanted to read were fantasy novels. Not Tolkien and Malory, but sword-and-sorcery pulp. I craved glowy blue magic, chainmail bikinis, dragons with unpronounceable names.","Readers have always read high and low, and to fight that urge is to fight the freedom inherent in the act of reading itself. The only arguments that have any traction, as best as I can see it, are about whether the genre classification of 'young adult' should exist at all.","Calling a book 'young adult' is only important in that it can help get a book to the right reader. After that, it's a useless abstraction and should be discarded.","Anguish over the loss of a loved one or feelings of helplessness have complex roots. But in the end, they make you feel bad because they adjust your brain's chemistry. Happiness and its opposite are both electro-chemical reactions; those reactions are temporary and ineffable and could even have hidden benefits.","Pick any scientific field, and you'll find that those snubbed by their communities, left feeling alone and despised, were often those on the forefront.","You can assume that the leaf you see let go of a branch and fall towards the ground has never been considered by any being but yourself. Catch it in your hand - or, even better, keep walking until one falls into your reach naturally - and it will have spent its whole time on the planet without ever touching the ground, only because of you.","The College Board is officially a non-profit. But all that means is that it doesn't have shareholders and that their financial accountings must be available to the public; it certainly doesn't mean that they're not also into making money.","The College Board is both in the business of test administration and test prep. If this feels inherently unfair, it should - it's like a doctor whacking your knee with a sledgehammer and then offering to patch you up.","Colleges accept the highest sub-scores from different administrations. So if a student takes the SAT many times instead of once, she has a larger pool of scores from which to pick out the highest math, critical reading, and writing.","Tutoring follows the lucrative philosophy of advertising: if you can manufacture a need, people with disposable resources will find ways to fill it.","Students raised on Park Avenue are born into family situations in which overachieving merely maintains the status quo, and therefore the market is primed for anyone offering services that provide an edge on local peers.","The SAT allows less-privileged students access to universities that previously were the bastions of the wealthy.","The most important factor in college admissions is a test that benefits those who are least prepared for college."],"Eliot Spitzer":["Yes, people pull the trigger - but guns are the instrument of death. Gun control is necessary, and delay means more death and horror.","Our criminal justice system is fallible. We know it, even though we don't like to admit it. It is fallible despite the best efforts of most within it to do justice. And this fallibility is, at the end of the day, the most compelling, persuasive, and winning argument against a death penalty.","The irony is that it was tougher to rent a car from Cerberus when it owned Alamo than to buy a semi-automatic. To rent a car, one had to provide ID, a drivers' license, and get insurance coverage. To buy a gun? Cash and carry, from the back of a station wagon at a gun show. No concerns about downstream liability or risk.","Delay is the enemy of progress.","As someone with a deep faith in competition and the market, I also know that markets only work with tough enforcement of the rules that guarantee competition and fair play - and that the pressure to break those rules only gets stronger as the amount of money involved gets larger.","I don't care about motivation. I care about credibility.","The attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon shook our nation to the core. Americans were deeply frightened, sad, and angry, and they rallied around a President who, at the time, showed impressive certitude and calm.","Those who are critical of Alliance are the same people who have done nothing for 30 years.","Shareholders have the right and obligation to set the parameters of corporate behavior within which management pursues profit.","After 25-plus years as a lawyer, prosecutor, and defense attorney, I have developed a deep appreciation for both the wisdom of the law and the role that jurists play in framing the rights and responsibilities that define our society.","I have long said there are three distinct groups under the GOP's tent: theological warriors, who want to impose their social views on the rest of society; Tea Party zealots, who say with a straight face that they want the government to get out of their Medicare; and remnants of the pro-business moderates.","I have acted in a way that violates my obligations to my family and violates my, or any, sense of right and wrong. I apologize first and most importantly to my family. I apologize to the public, whom I promised better.","In 2007, when I was governor of New York, I proposed that our state once again permit undocumented immigrants to obtain a driver's license. To say the proposal lit a firestorm in the political arena is an understatement.","President Obama is doing the right thing by offering young immigrants, most often in this country through no action of their own, a chance to live and work openly, free from the fear of deportation.","Why does it have to be politics? Is there a dynamism to that world and a theoretical capacity to do things that draws many talented people? Absolutely. Are there other ways to be involved and lead an interesting life? Of course.","Imagine if investors in Wal-Mart really cared about bribery at that company's overseas operations or safety standards at its overseas manufacturing plants. If investors pulled their capital, corporate leaders would have to respond.","Imagine if the pension funds and endowments that own much of the equity in our financial services companies demanded that those companies revisit the way mortgages were marketed to those without adequate skills to understand the products they were being sold. Management would have to change the way things were done.","To survive, the GOP needs to invite people in, not shut them out.","I think President Obama could have handled politics and policies differently. But he has been decisive, strong, and consistent - important qualities in a president. Mitt Romney is indeed an Etch A Sketch, the antithesis of leadership.","Technology is neutral: It convicts and finds innocents. We must make it a regularized part of the system, giving defendants access to DNA testing and evidence whenever it might be relevant.","A year is an eternity in politics - though less than a moment in history.","The wise decision by President Obama to grant some undocumented immigrants the right to remain in the United States for two years without the threat of deportation is already benefitting the country.","I stand before you today because this vision of government as the engine of opportunity is what I believe in.","It's time to let science and medicine, not politics and rhetoric, lead us to good, sound policy.","I believe in an evolving Constitution. A flexible Constitution leaves room for us to consider not merely how the world once was, but how it ought to be.","My career was obviously cut shorter than I wanted it to be.","I don't think Michael Bloomberg would say that his greatest skill is delivering the speech. He would say he's more of a nuts-and-bolts mayor-picking up the trash, dealing with the school system.","Jimmy Carter laid out policies that we now look back at and say, 'Gee, that actually made sense.' But you also need to explain it and convey and communicate in a way that provides that tableau, that understanding.","When you're in office, there are tangible moments when you can see tangible successes.","From those to whom much is given, much is expected. I have been given much - the love of my family, the faith and trust of the people of New York, and the chance to lead this state. I am deeply sorry that I did not live up to what was expected of me.","To every New Yorker - and to all those who believed in what I tried to stand for - I sincerely apologize.","I have disappointed and failed to live up to the standard I expected of myself.","The Chautauqua Institution is truly a national treasure. It is a place for contemplation and a place for reflection, a place where platitudes and slogans can be set aside and be replaced by thoughtfulness and introspection.","Power must be used, but it must be tempered by soul-searching and the recognition of our human capacity for error. That is the maxim that should inform our approach to every challenge, from reforming state government to engaging in foreign affairs.","Some say that I should settle down, go slower and not push so hard, so quickly for such transformational change. To them, I say that you misunderstand the size of the problems we face, the strength of the status quo and the urgency of the people's desire for change.","Sometimes in politics, you think you've seen it all. Turns out I was wrong.","I love and always have loved policy issues and trying to have an impact on the issues that are out there. I cherish my years in government. I have loved my participation at CNN, at Current; writing; teaching. Where I will go next, I will have to sort out.","I view Al Jazeera as a very serious journalistic outfit. They have proven to observers around the world that they are serious and objective. They will have to, at a P.R. level, prove to the American public that that is the case. And I think that over time they will succeed at doing that.","For me, journalism has been more a matter of projecting a particular approach to covering policies, to covering issues. It was a continuation of what I tried to do in government.","The Republican argument that raising the debt ceiling encourages additional future spending is logically irresponsible. The debt ceiling has to be raised to authorize spending already approved by Congress. Despite that fallacy, the GOP has been able to score political points with its argument.","Mitt Romney's primary season embrace of the social and economic agenda of the more rabid elements of his party doomed him, especially the shrill immigration rhetoric and the harshly insensitive theory that no additional sacrifice or contribution should be sought from those at the top.","While 2013 will not see a major national election, we can be sure that most Republicans will obstruct and some Democrats will appease.","Let's create a regime that makes sale of bullets to anybody not licensed to carry a gun illegal, makes resale illegal, micro-stamps bullets so they can be traced. No Second Amendment issues here. This would have a remarkable impact on both violence and the capacity to solve shooting crimes.","Any reasonable economist will tell you that it's nearly impossible to isolate the impact of right-to-work laws on a state's job growth. A multitude of other factors intervene. However, one thing the numbers can show is that right-to-work laws have a negative effect on the wages of workers in that state.","The world has conducted a massive macro-economic experiment since the cataclysm of 2008. In Europe, the fans of austerity have had their chance, and the results have been a disaster.","While their fiscal views aren't mine, the moderates are the last reasonable voice in the current Republican Party.","We are all used to paying a sales tax when we buy things - almost 9 percent here in New York City. The application of this concept to the financial sector could solve our need for revenue, bring some sanity back into the financial sector, and give us a way to raise the revenue we need to run the government in a fiscally responsible way.","Health care reform, the marquee legislative accomplishment of the Obama administration's first term, was passed before we entered the world of divided government.","The reality of split government puts a premium on creativity within the administration. President Obama needs to put the right people in charge of the agencies and then have them push the bounds of administrative power to change policy through those agencies. President Obama has a pretty good track record of this.","Tax rates for the wealthy should revert to Clinton-era levels, both because it is necessary for long-term deficit reduction and because fairness dictates it. Moreover, there is no proof that higher marginal rates dissuade investment, all the rhetoric from the Right notwithstanding.","The Tea Party isolated Mitt Romney from mainstream voters, linking him to a rabid ideology that he could not shake as he desperately tried to move to the middle in the closing weeks of the campaign. Lesson: The loudest voices don't often command the votes needed to win in November.","In the melting pot that is America, inclusive trumps exclusive. Whether it's single women, young adults, or minorities, alienating the rapidly growing voting blocs is not smart politics.","Virtually everywhere in the world, people still wake up and want their country to be more like the United States than any other nation. We are the envy of the world because of what we stand for and how our democratic process, flawed as it may often seem to be, operates. We should take pride in that.","Facts matter. Science matters. Reason matters. Mitt Romney has shown an inability to respect any of the three. President Barack Obama not only respects them, he relies on them. He is an overwhelming and unquestioned choice to continue as president.","Don't reward bad behavior. It is one of the first rules of parenting. During the financial cataclysm of 2008, we said it differently. When we bailed out banks that had created their own misfortune, we called it a 'moral hazard,' because the bailout absolved the bank's bad acts and created an incentive for it to make the same bad loans again.","As one who was a prosecutor for many years, I can tell you that having a tape recording of interrogations would help everybody. It would make clear if there had been improper pressure exerted on a defendant or witness, and it would also protect the interrogating officer from false claims that such pressure had been brought to bear.","A significant piece of the wealth that the NFL owners garner is a result of the enormous TV revenues they get - and those revenues are supported by a legislatively granted exemption from the antitrust laws that has been made applicable to sports leagues, primarily the NFL.","In nations where the voices of intolerance are most visible and momentarily powerful, it is in our long run interests to remain firm in our clear articulation that the use of violence in response to speech is to be condemned.","The Occupy movement needs an organizing principle, and - just as the Tea Party did - it needs some actual measures of success. Choose one candidate whose agenda is squarely within that of the movement and make his or her electoral success a focal point.","When the United States was founded, the very idea of a nation premised on democratic principles of freedom and tolerance was viewed by the vast majority of the world as an experiment doomed to fail. Dictatorships, monarchies, and theocracies had for many centuries ruled the world.","Every trial lawyer knows what it is like to sit patiently while the other side puts on its case. Inevitably they make a few points that appeal to the jury, and waiting for the opportunity to respond can be painful. The desire to jump up immediately - to point out the flaws in logic or the factual distortions - is often overpowering.","The pace of global warming is accelerating and the scale of the impact is devastating. The time for action is limited - we are approaching a tipping point beyond which the opportunity to reverse the damage of CO2 emissions will disappear.","Companies that pollute should be taxed so that a product's cost to society is reflected in the price of that product.","I don't like politicians who vacillate.","Public speaking? I speak to myself on the street!","I do not believe that politics in the long run is about individuals. It is about ideas.","Once again, the puppets on Capitol Hill are about to slam the Muppets on Main Street. The country still hasn't recovered from the Wall Street-induced financial cataclysm of 2008, yet Congress is preparing to enact the Orwellian 'JOBS Act' - a bill that should in fact be called the 'Return Fraud to Wall Street in One Easy Step Act.'","In politics you learn to always smile."],"Eliot Sumner":["It's always best to challenge yourself and go to a place out of your comfort zone.","I can only be myself, and if I have to suffer for that, that's okay, because to pretend to be somebody else - I tried that, it's terrible.","Self-sufficiency is vitally important to my self-respect. I never wanted to rely on my parents in that way, because I knew that if I got used to it, I'd be reliant all my life.","I'm very much a creature of habit. I don't like to try to new things.","I started listening to a lot of Jimi Hendrix and Neil Young when I was 8 or 9 years old - I had siblings that gave me good music instead of the crap that was on the radio in the '90s.","I wear a lot of black. Like my heart.","With social networks these days, everyone needs to know everything all the time. But the problem is, people are so used to short snippets of information that no one has any attention span anymore. I don't, anyway.","I write most of my stuff when I'm on a train or a plane, any mode of transport. I like trains because you hear this motoric rhythm and the scenery is great. You go into your own little world. You don't have to be anywhere else.","I'm an extremist. I don't do things in halves. I don't moderate anything. That can be with work or with good things as well. But often, I take it a bit too far.","I sometimes suffer from insomnia, and one of the first times it ever happened, I was like, 'I don't know what to do with myself,' so I started writing a song, and by morning, it was finished. It was about how I couldn't sleep... I was 14.","My French is terrible, and my Spanish is even worse. I find Spanish really difficult. They speak so quickly, whereas in German, it's very clear what they're saying. It's easier to repeat.","I try to read, but my attention span is so bad, and ever since Netflix was invented, that's all I do in my spare time, which is really bad, but it's like a chore to read for me.","I like to move around. It suits me. I grew up in Wiltshire on a farm, and that's the only place I call home.","I think I have a lot of energy, and most of it is quite aggressive energy. But in a positive way, I think. It's like a positive aggression.","I only wear black. I think it suits me.","It's not a nice thing to have a song written about you.","I think, forever, I was trying to figure out maybe... what I am. But I don't think anyone should feel pressured to have any kind of label or tag on them. We should treat everybody the same... Me, I don't like to be put down to a specific thing. We're all human beings.","I was somewhat of a mute at school, so people were quite scared!","People always have to have a reference - I think I'll always be in the shadow of my parents.","Music is about self-expression and representing the times, and I think fashion is the same. It took me a long time to find my own style, both in terms of fashion and music.","For me, Paul Simon has always been an incredible songwriter, as he writes very complicated songs that sound very simple, and he makes it look so easy when it's not.","It's difficult to explain exactly how I react to music, but if it makes me feel anything at all, then I'll have some kind of emotional relationship to it. That's what defines good music to me - if it makes me truly feel something.","On my fourth or fifth birthday, a guitar was given to me, and I made a new friend. A very loud friend.","With a band I feel stronger. It's not just me and my weird thoughts.","I didn't come out as gay; I came out as I don't really believe in gender.","Being Sting's daughter hasn't kicked any doors open for me - he has had absolutely nothing to do with my career. It's all been down to me so far, and that's how I want to keep it.","In 2009, I fractured my skull in a freak accident at an L.A. restaurant. I suffered a seizure and was rushed into hospital. I was so out of it that I refused to let them scan my brain. My dad rushed to my bedside and talked me into having the CAT scan - he told me that I might die if I didn't go through with it.","As a kid, I loved to dress up as Ian Dury and run around hitting people with drumsticks. Members of my family, neighbours, friends, kids at school - no one was safe from my rhythm sticks.","I'm a bit of a geek when it comes to music. I like studio gear. I'm always looking it up on eBay and seeing what I can afford.","It stresses me out writing songs,; I get really super nervous and speedy. I feel like I'm possessed.","I'm very shy and awkward; I can't have a normal conversation, and then people think I'm being a bit rude, but really I'm not.","I think everyone's got an obstacle in their career that they have to challenge. I think, in a way, that pushes you to prove who you are.","I knew I wasn't going to write a record as soon as I got signed, because I hadn't had any life experiences. I was still at school, and I wasn't going to write about that.","Music is the only thing that I trust.","I make my songs slightly abstract so that people can interpret them their own way. I think that's a lot more special, so you can hear a song and think, 'I feel exactly that way,' even if it wasn't written for that feeling.","I was very young when I did 'I Blame Coco,' and I never really recognized that sound as me.","I picked up the guitar when I was 4, and from then, I could never be bored.","I would make documentaries if it was a worthy cause. I have a lot of respect for people who put themselves in harm's way to make people see that something needs to be done.","I don't particularly like attention. I like to do things on my own. I like to dress myself. People always ask that at shoots: 'Do you want any help?' That's the weirdest question.","I don't look into myself too much. I don't think I'm shy so much as a better listener than I am a speaker. I just really don't wish for attention.","I like to write from a slightly sad or complicated place. But with a sense of hope and happiness at the same time."],"Eliphas Levi":["A good teacher must be able to put himself in the place of those who find learning hard.","Order is never observed; it is disorder that attracts attention because it is awkward and intrusive."],"Elisabeth Harnois":["Whether it's a blessing or a curse, I have always played someone like 10 years younger. When I was 23 or 24, I was playing 15 opposite Evan Rachel Wood in a movie called 'Pretty Persuasion.' She was 16 and nobody in a million years would have thought I was that much older than her.","That's an amazing gift as an actor - to be able to say I have an audience in so many countries in the world and that people know my work.","Working out makes me feel good. When I don't work out for a few days, I start feeling grumpy. When I'm at the gym, it wakes me up. My spirits are higher. I just feel happier and more motivated to do things.","I run a lot. I love running. I try to run at least half an hour a day.","The more you work out, the more you get the energy to do it. And the more you get motivated to do it, especially when you start seeing results."],"Elisabeth Hasselbeck":["Nobody's life is ever all balanced. It's a conscious decision to choose your priorities every day.","Pregnancy and motherhood are the most beautiful and significantly life-altering events that I have ever experienced.","You can't beg from people what they're not willing to give you.","I love Central Park. I feel like I am somewhere else.","It's amazing, the mentality shift that occurs in pregnancy. All of a sudden you want to be good to yourself.","When I get home from a heavy work day, I make sure I get outside with the kids. I don't think there's any better cure than being active as a family outside.","I don't have a problem with conflict. I'm not a stranger to high-pressure situations. I've been there, believe me.","It's too hard to present an opinion on something that's not true to who you are. It's much easier to base opinions and debates off of fact and your true heart on things. To me that just comes quite naturally, and it's also about being open to what the debate is about and hearing the other side.","I like to think there are a lot of balls in the air, and the kids are not one that I choose to drop. They have been a priority and I have a career that allows for a little more flexibility at times and hours that are quite mom-friendly.","The best Mother's Day gift I ever got was just a full day with the kids where they did their mommy pampering. They cut cucumbers and put them on my eyes and my daughter gave me a facial. I'm not even sure what was in it!","I've always thought that if you work really hard at something, you can get it.","I would like to have three or four kids.","I tend to absorb a lot of what other people are feeling.","I don't claim to be someone that knows every verse in the Bible. I wish I did. I truly do. It just means I need to spend more time in those pages.","There are some days when I think for sure there are so many other stronger Christians than me out there.","There's always going to be a ball up in the air, and what I try to do is make sure that ball is never the kids. If that means sacrificing a social event or having fewer work commitments, it's worth it.","To see your spouse in a parental role is one of the most incredible things.","I majored in industrial design/painting, but haven't had time to exercise that creativity.","Knowing someone else is going through the bizarreness of pregnancy with you makes it feel a little less impossible.","I do splurge on diaper bags. I have a half dozen in different colors and styles.","Undoubtedly, the biggest misconception about me is that I'm some staunch conservative, blind, rightwing hardcore Republican who doesn't want to hear anything from the other side.","I'm not worried about misconception or a perception that's bad. If I were, I'd be chasing something all the time.","I have to live in the truth that this is who I am. That's what I need to focus on.","I'm a true believer that if someone bothers you, you care.","I prioritize the things that need to get done at work, and I ask myself where I'm spending the majority of my time. The answer to that question always needs to be 'with my family.'","Every day is a learning experience for city kids, and they are really sort of forced to interact with everyone around them and develop into social beings.","I get worried sometimes that people are saying 'Why is she on television - is it because of Survivor?' That people are saying, 'She got here the easy way.' But I have been working hard all these years, and I figured I needed to move forward and embrace it, respect it and perfect it. If I didn't, then everybody would lose."],"Elisabeth Kubler-Ross":["The most beautiful people we have known are those who have known defeat, known suffering, known struggle, known loss, and have found their way out of those depths.","Learn to get in touch with the silence within yourself, and know that everything in life has purpose. There are no mistakes, no coincidences, all events are blessings given to us to learn from.","The five stages - denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance - are a part of the framework that makes up our learning to live with the one we lost. They are tools to help us frame and identify what we may be feeling. But they are not stops on some linear timeline in grief.","People are like stained - glass windows. They sparkle and shine when the sun is out, but when the darkness sets in, their true beauty is revealed only if there is a light from within.","Learning lessons is a little like reaching maturity. You're not suddenly more happy, wealthy, or powerful, but you understand the world around you better, and you're at peace with yourself. Learning life's lessons is not about making your life perfect, but about seeing life as it was meant to be.","Should you shield the canyons from the windstorms you would never see the true beauty of their carvings.","I believe that we are solely responsible for our choices, and we have to accept the consequences of every deed, word, and thought throughout our lifetime.","The ultimate lesson all of us have to learn is unconditional love, which includes not only others but ourselves as well.","It is important to feel the anger without judging it, without attempting to find meaning in it. It may take many forms: anger at the health-care system, at life, at your loved one for leaving. Life is unfair. Death is unfair. Anger is a natural reaction to the unfairness of loss.","I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that there is no death the way we understood it. The body dies, but not the soul.","Consciously or not, we are all on a quest for answers, trying to learn the lessons of life. We grapple with fear and guilt. We search for meaning, love, and power. We try to understand fear, loss, and time. We seek to discover who we are and how we can become truly happy.","It's only when we truly know and understand that we have a limited time on earth - and that we have no way of knowing when our time is up, we will then begin to live each day to the fullest, as if it was the only one we had.","I think modern medicine has become like a prophet offering a life free of pain. It is nonsense. The only thing I know that truly heals people is unconditional love.","People after death become complete again. The blind can see, the deaf can hear, cripples are no longer crippled after all their vital signs have ceased to exist.","Denial helps us to pace our feelings of grief. There is a grace in denial. It is nature's way of letting in only as much as we can handle.","I've told my children that when I die, to release balloons in the sky to celebrate that I graduated. For me, death is a graduation.","Death is not painful. It is the most beautiful experience you will have.","I was destined to work with dying patients. I had no choice when I encountered my first AIDS patient. I felt called to travel some 250,000 miles each year to hold workshops that helped people cope with the most painful aspects of life, death and the transition between the two.","We need to teach the next generation of children from day one that they are responsible for their lives. Mankind's greatest gift, also its greatest curse, is that we have free choice. We can make our choices built from love or from fear.","The opinion which other people have of you is their problem, not yours.","The simple life on the farm was everything to me. Nothing was more relaxing after a long plane flight than to reach the winding driveway that led up to my house. The quiet of the night was more soothing than a sleeping pill.","Those who have the strength and the love to sit with a dying patient in the silence that goes beyond words will know that this moment is neither frightening nor painful, but a peaceful cessation of the functioning of the body.","Those who learned to know death, rather than to fear and fight it, become our teachers about life.","Live, so you do not have to look back and say: 'God, how I have wasted my life.'","It's only when we truly know and understand that we have a limited time on Earth - and that we have no way of knowing when our time is up - that we will begin to live each day to the fullest, as if it was the only one we had.","I always say that death can be one of the greatest experiences ever. If you live each day of your life right, then you have nothing to fear.","Watching a peaceful death of a human being reminds us of a falling star; one of a million lights in a vast sky that flares up for a brief moment only to disappear into the endless night forever.","Love is really the only thing we can possess, keep with us, and take with us.","It is inconceivable for our unconscious to imagine an actual ending of our own life here on Earth, and if this life of ours has to end, the ending is always attributed to a malicious intervention from the outside by someone else.","As far as service goes, it can take the form of a million things. To do service, you don't have to be a doctor working in the slums for free, or become a social worker. Your position in life and what you do doesn't matter as much as how you do what you do.","It is not the end of the physical body that should worry us. Rather, our concern must be to live while we're alive - to release our inner selves from the spiritual death that comes with living behind a facade designed to conform to external definitions of who and what we are.","It is difficult to accept death in this society because it is unfamiliar. In spite of the fact that it happens all the time, we never see it.","If people would get in touch with their spirits, they would be able to heal, emotionally and physically.","According to my parents, I was supposed to have been a nice, churchgoing Swiss housewife. Instead I ended up an opinionated psychiatrist, author and lecturer in the American Southwest, who communicates with spirits from a world that I believe is far more loving and glorious than our own.","The truth does not need to be defended.","Any natural, normal human being, when faced with any kind of loss, will go from shock all the way through acceptance.","For those who seek to understand it, death is a highly creative force. The highest spiritual values of life can originate from the thought and study of death.","When we grow older and begin to realize that our omnipotence is really not so omnipotent, that our strongest wishes are not powerful enough to make the impossible possible, the fear that we have contributed to the death of a loved one diminishes - and with it, the guilt.","My work with AIDS patients started right at the beginning of the epidemic, totally unplanned and spontaneous, as all my work had proceeded in the previous two decades, if it were not already my whole life-style! In the early eighties, we knew very little about this peculiar disease.","Medicine has changed greatly in the last decades. Widespread vaccinations have practically eradicated many illnesses, at least in western Europe and the United States. The use of chemotherapy, especially the antibiotics, has contributed to an ever decreasing number of fatalities in infectious diseases.","When I came to this country in 1958, to be a dying patient in a medical hospital was a nightmare. You were put in the last room, furthest away from the nurses' station. You were full of pain, but they wouldn't give you morphine. Nobody told you that you were full of cancer and that it was understandable that you had pain and needed medication.","I say to people who care for people who are dying, if you really love that person and want to help them, be with them when their end comes close. Sit with them - you don't even have to talk. You don't have to do anything but really be there with them.","I'm going to dance in all the galaxies.","I didn't fully realize it at the time, but the goal of my life was profoundly molded by this experience - to help produce, in the next generation, more Mother Teresas and less Hitlers.","We're put here on Earth to learn our own lessons. No one can tell you what your lessons are; it is part of your personal journey to discover them. On these journeys we may be given a lot, or just a little bit, of the things we must grapple with, but never more than we can handle.","I only believe in what I see and hear with my own eyes and ears.","Dying is something we human beings do continuously, not just at the end of our physical lives on this earth.","For years, I have been stalked by a bad reputation. Actually, I have been pursued by people who have regarded me as the 'Death and Dying' Lady. They believe that having spent more than three decades in research into death and life after death qualifies me as an expert on the subject. I think they miss the point.","The only incontrovertible fact of my work is the importance of life.","We often assume that if we are good people we will not suffer the ills of the world.","Death is staring too long into the burning sun and the relief of entering a cool, dark room."],"Elisabeth Moss":["To go from Girl, Interrupted, where I had to cry every day, to a TV show like West Wing where I get to laugh and joke around every day, has been a welcome relief.","I heard that people were really interested in the new haircut, which I think is so funny. Great haircut, I really like it. It goes great with the time period. And I was super, super, super-happy to have my bangs swept to the side rather than straight in front of me, which I dealt with for three seasons. I'm very, very much done with that.","I think every day there is some new actress comes out and inspires me to do something else... like Hilary Swank. After she did Boys Don't Cry, I felt this yearning to go out and be even half as good as she was.","There's nothing like getting yourself into character and seeing a different person. It really wears on your vanity.","I don't feel I was ever a 'famous' child actor. I was just a working actor who happened to be a kid. I was never really in a hit show until I was a teenager with West Wing playing First Daughter Zoey Bartlet. In a way, that was my saving grace - not being a star on a hit show. It kept me working and kept me grounded.","I think my guideline has been to find things that inspire me. And as long as I stick to that, I don't think I'll have any problems crossing over to becoming an adult actress.","I think one of my biggest influences is Bette Davis. I've seen almost every one of her films, and she's been very inspiring to me.","The great thing about Pete and Peggy's storyline is that you barely have to do anything. There's so much there, so much history, that you can have them exchange a look and it's so loaded. So you honestly don't have to do anything.","I love working with male actors, and I think there's a tendency to write really interesting characters that would work solely alongside men where they would be in a man's world and have to deal with that, and it creates a lot of interesting storylines. For me, it's kind of circumstantial, but I definitely enjoy it.","It's a great dynamic. The dynamic between men and women in the workplace is really interesting.","I don't think any of us could have possibly anticipated how successful Mad Men has been. When we were working on the pilot, we loved it. We thought it was special. We hoped and prayed it'd be a success. But, we didn't count on it.","Obviously, my life and my job in 2010 is very different from Peggy's experience in the 1960s. I exist in a world that enjoys more equality between men and women. But I don't take any of that into my performance. I just want to play the character as who she is as an individual - scene to scene."],"Elisabeth Rohm":["Better to just be real. Show up and do your job and be a nice person.","I always wanted the fairy tale, but now I want someone who is a great partner.","I try to watch the show every week and improve upon myself. I've become a fan.","You never stop learning. If you have a teacher, you never stop being a student.","I have a lot of courage. I'm a realist.","That difficult place to put your finger on about the world - it needs to be illustrated.","I was very excited about the idea that I could be an idealist, that I could be my age, the eager beaver who had hope in the justice system and the one who gets disappointed just like the audience.","Dick Wolf was my first boss after coming out of Sarah Lawrence.","I don't think people were betting on me, but they were giving me a chance. I think I rode a wave there, by being different in appearance than the girls who preceded me.","I got out of college in 1997, and TV embraced me very quickly.","I had a soap opera, and my next job was working with Kyle McLachlan on The Invisible Man.","I needed to move, but I haven't had the time to find a place to go.","I stuck out like a sore thumb when I came on, just by the fact that I looked so different. I think that adjustment for the audience was a hurdle for me.","I would love for TNT to run the whole season at one point. I don't think that'll ever happen, though.","I'm a great fan of Carey Lowell's and I loved Jill Hennessey.","I'm a straight shooter, a New York City girl. I see things as they are and call them as they are.","I've grown as a person. The dynamics on this set are very demanding because we work a lot of hours, it's very sad material, so there's always someone upset because it's really heavy stuff.","I've grown up so much here. It's been two years. I've become a woman here, I've become an actress here.","It would probably break my heart to hear that people didn't like me. I don't look on the Internet.","It's really nice to pass the ball when you're in an ensemble cast.","Life came in and put me in front of the camera before I could really make a decision, but I think I probably would have gravitated to film.","The business is a very tricky obstacle course, and you should be very clear about work begetting work. If you're not working, you're not interesting.","What made me fall in love with acting, which is my life, was watching other people perform. It made me hunger to do that.","When you fall head over heels for someone, you're not falling in love with who they are as a person; you're falling in love with your idea of love.","You've got to clock the hours and pay your dues. Then eventually, people will come to you. You have to be patient and appreciative."],"Elisabeth Schwarzkopf":["There are names I do not want mentioned in my home.","Many composers today don't know what the human throat is.","At Bloomington, Indiana, I was invited to listen to music written in quarter tones for four harps and voices. I had to go out to be sick."],"Elisabeth Shue":["When you get into your 40s, it's all about lighting. It's hard. You have to face whether the way you look is your self-worth or not. Once you get beyond that, it's all about what's in your heart.","I don't think 'Cocktail' was a perfect critical success, but it touched a vein in our culture.","I may be the girl next door, but you wouldn't want to live next to me.","After Leaving Las Vegas I did assume that things would get a lot easier than they've been. But it's just been a mirror of the way my career's been from the beginning, so for it to have changed would have been strange. My career has never been perfect.","I don't have high expectations anymore. Maybe they've just been beaten out of me.","I spent my whole life trying to play the games males play.","I understand now that the vulnerability I've always felt is the greatest strength a person can have. You can't experience life without feeling life. What I've learned is that being vulnerable to somebody you love is not a weakness, it's a strength.","I feel like my first conversation with someone, I really get a good feeling about who that person is and mainly about how open they are.","I have worked with another first-time director who was not that open, and it was probably one of the worst experiences I ever had, so my antennas are really out.","It would be really wonderful if people connected to the loneliness of what it means to be a human being in the world today.","I may look like the girl next door, but you wouldn't want to live next door to me.","The darker, more complex and emotional the part is, the easier it is for me. But I don't take any of that stuff home with me at the end of the day.","Every experience makes you grow.","My mom had started to go to work when I was nine or ten, so I was aware of women trying to find their own identities by working. But I was still influenced by men to such an extreme. I wanted to play their games and wanted to compete in their world and be like them.","Growing up with three boys in a heavily male-dominated world, I especially needed to express myself as a woman.","Sometimes when I read about my rebellion in print it sounds a little overrated.","I did 'The Karate Kid,' then I just went back to college. I didn't know how much money it made and I didn't have a publicist. I didn't have any sense of the business part of it.","People love to talk about how the '70s are the only time they made movies about characters, and adult movies, and complicated people. But in the '80s, they got away with some of those too.","I really love 'Soapdish.' I wish 'Soapdish' had more of a moment because I felt that that is a really strong, funny movie. Kevin Kline is hilarious in that movie.","For many years, I decided not to do television because I have three children, but now my youngest is finally old enough to be in kindergarten. So I'm not feeling that kind of tug of not being with her as much.","Like, that was weird in 'Hamlet 2,' because I played myself there, fully myself, but then I realized, 'Oh, I'm not playing myself. I'm some weird version of myself.' So as an actress, you're always playing something, I don't even know who I am, how could I become me? I don't know what that is.","As the only girl growing up among three brothers, I was always afraid of being excluded. If there was a game to be played, a sport to be learned, a competition to join, I was on my feet and ready. I didn't spend much time alone for fear that I'd miss out.","I was on my own at Wellesley, surrounded by a lot of young women who were motivated and intellectually curious. I started to read because I was required to do so for class, but I soon found myself enjoying the seclusion of the library. I came to see reading as an important way to learn about people, including myself.","Today I still feel like the most illiterate person ever to have roamed the campuses of Wellesley and Harvard, where I later transferred. I remain intimidated by all the books I haven't read, but over the years I've come to realize that being a student is a lifelong adventure.","Almost six years ago, before I was given the incredible opportunity to be in 'Leaving Las Vegas,' I was going through a long period of artistic confusion. I'd spent years doing work that hadn't pushed me enough, and I was beginning to wonder if I had any talent.","Robert Kennedy was such an inspiring figure. His interest in politics seemed to come not from a desire for power, but from a need to help our society live up to its ideals.","After three major movies, I was like, 'Oh, I guess you're supposed to get a publicist?' Girls that are in the business now that are successful are more savvy.","I was a complete unknown when I did 'Karate Kid.' I'd just done a pilot for a TV show called 'Call to Glory.' And I sat down with John Avildsen and brought still pictures from the show. I brought pictures! At that point, I would've been happy to be in a dog-food commercial.","I try really hard to give my kids as much independence as I can, caring mostly about their character: Are they kind? Generous? Do they work hard?","The movie I'm really excited about that I had really fun doing is 'Feed the Dog.' It's with Nat Wolff and Selena Gomez. It's really fun. It's raunchy, like 'Superbad' meets 'Risky Business,' kind of. I got to be a really fun character, an out-there Mrs. Robinson-type character. I get to seduce Nat.","It took a lot to get attention in my family. No wonder I'm an actress.","I want to be involved with young people in some way. Teenagers. Because that's the most vulnerable time. I have a fantasy of becoming a teacher one day.","I see myself at a certain age as not being able to play the kind of parts that would keep me stimulated, and I can't imagine my life ending professionally the moment that I've got to go to the plastic surgeon and have my face rearranged.","Every film is a crapshoot. It's a mystery when a movie comes together. I've never been able to figure it out. I don't know how I make my choices. The only thing you can do is know there's something about a character that you really want to experience.","The hard thing about 'The Saint' was that my character was supposed to die, but then they reshot the ending based on tests and she lives. I created the character based on her dying - she would never have been as innocent otherwise. So I didn't have high expectations for that film.","What keeps this industry challenging as an actor is that you never know how something will turn out. The ups and downs are constant. You're never just smoothly sailing along. You're always going to be on loose footing. That's what ultimately now I expect and accept and that doesn't scare me as much.","Everyone at 'CSI' has been so great to work with, and so great in terms of scheduling. There's a real feeling of family on that set... I've grown to have so much respect for the cast and crew - they're been together so many years and still care about the show and each other."],"Elisabeth Sladen":["Sometimes good television doesn't depend on money, it depends on imagination and good people directing, casting and doing the job with talented people.","I love radio, and I haven't done it - other than the actual 'Doctor Who' - for so long now. It takes a different kind of discipline and a different kind of enjoyment, really."],"Elisabeth von Thurn und Taxis":["I enjoy looking, learning, smiling, and engaging with art, sometimes even rejecting it.","As for what I might wear, my mantra is that, no matter how chic the event, I don't want to look too prim. I like wearing short cocktail frocks to black-tie events; it just always feels more like me, and a bright red lip is always a staple.","Our wild boar shoot at our home in Germany is always a riot because we invite lots of friends. We spend the day out in the woods, but then we get all dressed up in long gowns to dance around in the evenings.","Edie Sedgwick, Debbie Harry, Chloe Sevigny, Michelle Obama, and my friend Eugenie Niarchos each have their own great sense of style.","I have long accepted that an art fair is not a perfectly curated museum show. Instead, it's more like a brightly lit bazaar, where art is haggled over and handled like any other commodity.","The fall couture presentations in Paris are usually my favorite moment on the fashion calendar: beautiful weather, a busy rather than manic schedule, and, let's face it, seeing the artistry, the embroidery, and handmade magnificence that goes into every dress."],"Elisabetta Canalis":["At the end of the day I have always seen the end of my relationships as a personal failure. There is nothing ever pretty in saying goodbye.","Since I was a little kid, I was against fur. I never wore fur in my life.","I am a firm believer in marriage. In the future I will be married.","I don't always have the stomach muscles I have, and I get cellulite as well like everyone else.","Sometimes when I flick through a magazine and see these thin models I'm left wondering what effect they can have on an insecure person. But I say to girls: forget what you see in the magazines, that is a world which has nothing to do with reality; think of it as a cartoon.","I love variety in my life.","I'm a bit of a tomboy, but when it comes to love I am a doormat.","I'm looking for men who can give me security.","I have always seen cold and controlled men as the right ones for me.","In the past I would self destruct when it came to love - I was immature, throwing myself into things but now times have changed, I want a relationship where you understand the other person.","My maternal desires are fully satisfied with my dogs.","American men are more open, they are readier to express their emotions, but they also get frightened easily. Italians are used to drama. For us, arguing, shouting is perfectly normal - for them it is inconceivable."],"Elise Andrew":["To be honest, what I struggled with in my degree is what's so helpful when it comes to social media in that I lack focus. I'll start reading about evolutionary biology and end up on quantum physics. While that makes writing your dissertation very difficult, for a page like IFLS, that's amazing because I get a wide range of everything.","I was absolutely astonished by an onslaught of comments expressing their absolute shock that IFLS is run by a woman.","I don't really understand why people are so interested in me, personally. I'm just a curator. I'm just telling people things I think are cool.","I'm such a generalist. I love everything. If I had the opportunity, I think I would do about 10 different degrees, five different master's degrees, probably as many Ph.D.s, and you can't do that.","People in general romanticize nature, and they make it out to be something that it isn't because humans are so awful. And yes, we are absolutely screwing up this planet, but that is only because we have the capabilities to do so. Animals are not better than us. They are not nicer than us.","One of the reasons I'm so passionate about science is that it wasn't correctly taught to me. I got excited at university.","I remember my first lecture on my first day in evolutionary biology, how populations and species change. I sat thinking, 'Why doesn't everyone know this?' I look back on it almost in horror: I came so close to not knowing how exciting our world is.","In science, every question answered leads to 10 more. I love that science can never, ever be finished. From a young age, people think, 'Science is hard and boring.' We don't tell children, 'Yes, you have to learn these formulae and theorems, but then you go on to learn about nuclear reactions and stars.'","I sleep five or six hours a night, then crash at the weekend. I'm learning to eat properly and exercise. I relax by watching silly sitcoms like 'Scrubs' and 'How I Met Your Mother.'","There is a lot of pseudo-science and nonsense out there on the Internet, and everyone feels the need to send it to me. And I'm sitting there thinking, 'It isn't real! Stop it!'","Often, some people dress something up to make it sound scientific, use scientific words, call themselves doctor something-or-other, and then you look them up, and they're trying to make it sound like something it's not. There's this entire field that's adding the word 'quantum' to everything. It doesn't even make sense in that context.","If you're going to believe crazy things, people are going to laugh at you.","A lot of people view science as dull or boring, and I think the stance we take, using humour, not taking ourselves too seriously... I think people enjoy that. I think it's quite refreshing.","It's a sad day when a woman being funny and interested in science is considered newsworthy.","Sometimes I worry that science communication is just preaching to the choir, speaking to the converted. Social media gives us an amazing opportunity to reach new people.","My degree is in biology, and it will always be my first love. Evolution, ecology, genetics - they were the textbooks I was devouring as a teenager, and it was there that my love of science grew.","My attention is constantly being caught! I'm constantly learning, constantly becoming fascinated by new things - I'm lucky that I read incredibly quickly and absorb a lot of information easily, because otherwise I don't think I'd ever get my head out of a book!","I'm not a model or an actress; I'm just a 23 year old who likes to talk about science. Why does what I look like matter so much?","I'm very lucky because people send me a lot of stuff and post cool articles and pictures on my wall, which does make life a lot easier for me. When we were at 60,000 or 100,000 'likes,' I was still having to source the content myself, and I was constantly trolling the Internet, whereas now things are sent to me, which does make it a lot easier.","There aren't that many female role models in science. There are a couple of women, but mostly you've got Neil deGrasse Tyson, Richard Dawkins, Lawrence Krauss - they're all guys. Bill Nye the Science Guy. I love that guy, but it's all guys.","When we think of scientists, we hear a man's voice."],"Elise Broach":["My kids have grown up knowing that their mom made a big investment in making sure there was art and language instruction in school and books in the library. Hopefully, they've internalized that.","I wrote my senior essay on the Santa Fe Writer's Colony and my dissertation on sacred landscapes - the Grand Canyon, the Dakota Badlands. As a setting, I love the West. I just love that western landscape.","The funny thing is, though I write mysteries, it is the one genre in adult fiction I never read. I read Nancy Drew, of course, when I was a kid, but I think the real appeal is as a writer because I'm drawn to puzzly, complicated plots.","Mysteries always have the potential for interesting connections between the elements. I'm also most interested in the relationship between the characters. As in 'Masterpiece,' I'm trying to create characters who not only are solving a mystery but are solving the riddle of their own personal relationships."],"Elisha Cuthbert":["There's nothing more romantic than Italian food.","The celebrity body I most admire is Madonna's. She has the most incredible physique - and the woman's in her 50s!","I don't look in the mirror and think that I have flaws. I actually look in the mirror and see me. I see a lot of different characters and a lot of different things.","When I was 20, I thought I was 30 - but I was so far from it. When you're young, you want everything to happen now. As you mature, you can look back and see all the great things you achieved with time and patience.","I know, it was a little bit out of control, but hey. It was all fun.","I don't ever want to be doing the same sort of thing, I never want to be typecast, because I have way too much to give to be sort of, to always be the hot chick in the movie.","The problem with TV now is that there's so much competition, that you're always on the chopping block.","I think that, back in the day, there used to be a lot of horror films that kind of had a checklist of what went into making the 'perfect horror film', and I think now people are raising the bar in the industry, as far as the types of horror films that are being made.","You know, I've never been much of a method actor. I feel like, with every project I go in extremely prepared and I like to have a good time.","I think with comedy I get very sort of critical of myself and try and do the best I can and it doesn't come as second nature. I work at those kinds of films. It doesn't mean I can't do them - I've done two now, and I have a great time doing them, but I just find myself a little bit more neurotic.","I do try and stay away from the stereotype and getting typecast.","I just don't like showing everything I've got. I don't want to look like I'm trying too hard to be sexy.","Yeah, I've gotten a few letters from prison.","Celebrity or no celebrity, I think a lot of females deal with the fear of being abducted.","Some of the things I've seen a lot of my female-actress friends who are relatively famous receive - I've seen some hideous things. Like some really, really bad things... like, the FBI should be contacted immediately.","I go into every film not just wanting to play the hot girl in the movie. It kills me.","It's hard to be scared if you don't feel for a character, because you don't care if they die or live.","I don't think anything can prepare you for a crew to come in and actually film you as yourself. It's kind of frightening to think that all of a sudden people are going to know how you are, and how you act on a day-to-day basis.","I have lots of records, quite a collection, actually, that I stole from my mom. I have the original 'Thriller' album and I have a really great 'Elton John's Greatest Hits,' and I also have a N.E.R.D. album. Records sound more original. They have more edge.","I'm one of those low-maintenance people - let's get it done and get going. It's not that painful to wax, but... I don't have time for it - just give me the razor.","I don't like to play characters that are one note, and just the attractive girl in the film.","I watch what I eat obviously. I'm not a regular gym-goer but I'm conscious of it.","I'm into eating salads and fish. I've always been a big fish eater. I like fruit. I have friends that you have to force-feed them the good stuff. I'm lucky I actually like it. Brussel sprouts and all that.","I guess there's a vulnerability in seeing a female character trying to get out of something really drastic.","It's amazing that for actors mostly, it's a risk to attach yourself to a film that you don't know whether or not it's going to even be made and if you sign on, in doing so, who else is going to be in the movie with you.","As long as I can make an audience feel something, I don't care whether it's a good thing or bad thing, just to feel something is important to me.","You're lucky enough in television to always be at it, to always be doing it. It's like you're constantly that person, always, all the time. It gets to be like clockwork.","I think it's so wrong to play the victim. There's too many brave women out there that just won't even tolerate it, you know?","I think there's a lot of elements that go into making a really awesome horror film and that's like putting together like a real good group of people that you love to watch them either live or die.","I'm used to being someone else 10 months out of the year.","I've always been against trying to make a movie like another movie. That's lame. It's already been done, so why do it again?","The pressure to be pretty? I set, you know, boundaries and goals for myself. I try not to compare myself to anyone else because I will never be anyone else except myself. So I try and stay true to me, and hopefully the right projects will come my way.","Life is funny and it is interesting how we make it as serious as possible.","I think wardrobe is a really important part of making a movie and developing the character.","A lot of people loved to hate my character on 24. I want to be the character people love to love.","I do believe that when you know better, you do better. You know what was wrong about the last relationship, and hopefully you will do better the next time.","I'm a regular Canadian girl. I enjoy staying home. In the summer I've got a garden. I'm very much a homebody, a normal, family-oriented girl. But I do have this other incredible side of my life that involves acting and traveling.","You can make a feature that makes millions but only so many people see it. With a hit TV show, every week you'll have 16 million - 20 million people watching you.","I don't like anything that's too confining. I'm sort of a control freak, so anything that makes me feel like I'm out of control is a bit uncomfortable. But you know how it is, sometimes it's good to live a little!","I tend to stay out of the public eye a little, compared to some of my peers.","I was bitten by a brown recluse spider. It got me as I was coming out of the shower. I'd never seen that kind of spider before, I'm from Canada and we don't get those types up there.","I've always wanted to shave my head for a role because I've wanted to play a character who had a shaved head. I don't know what the fascination is.","I really know right from wrong and apply that to my life. At home, I was the oldest of three. My role was to be the responsible one."],"Elisha Gray":["Some may claim that is it unscientific to speak of the operations of nature as miracles. But the point of the title lies in the paradox of finding so many wonderful things subservient to the rule of law.","As to Bell's talking telegraph, it only creates interest in scientific circles... its commercial values will be limited."],"Eliyahu Goldratt":["Good luck is when opportunity meets preparation, while bad luck is when lack of preparation meets reality.","Automation is good, so long as you know exactly where to put the machine.","Almost all decisions based on cost accounting are utterly wrong.","Every situation can be substantially improved; even the sky is not the limit.","If you want people to take action,you must refrain from giving them the answers.","For me, 'educator' is the highest title that exists.","You need collaboration of its people; it's the only way to improve a company - can you ignore that? You need a win-win for every sub-group, which will ensure exponential growth for a company.","To be a good manager, a manager tries to constantly fight to reduce waste.","Every situation, no matter how complex it initially looks, is exceedingly simple.","Every conflict can be removed.","Every person can reach a full life.","The problem with a cost reduction strategy is that there is a finite limit.You can only get to zero.","As a CEO, you have to take the active action to force most of your resources to stand idle from time to time - or go bankrupt.","Why is it that common sense is seldom common practice?","I call myself an educator.","Every one of you is a super genius if you just focus your common sense.","I took inspiration from 'Fountainhead,' the way in which Ayn Rand conveyed her political philosophy through an immensely popular novel.","Conditions impact the behaviour of people.","Growth becomes less important than stability; we have to give people changes slowly.","We have to have workers that will produce more and will stop work when it is not needed.","If the system should not need parts now, the worker should not produce because you are just absorbing instead of producing."],"Eliza Cook":["There's a magical tie to the land of our home, which the heart cannot break, though the footsteps may roam.","Why should we strive, with cynic frown, to knock their fairy castles down?","How cruelly sweet are the echoes that start, When memory plays an old tune on the heart.","Who would not rather trust and be deceived?","Though language forms the preacher, 'Tis good works make the man."],"Eliza Coupe":["I made sure that instead of people making fun of me, like every comedian probably says, I made fun of myself first so they would get distracted and just laugh. I was pretty brutally picked on for a while growing up. It was always the really pretty girls, the hot girls and then there was me. So I had to do something to get any sort of attention.","I was trained classically, and that's something that I want to do, but I do want to say that right now it's a good market for female comedians, and I want to explore that right now. I really do want to do dramas and meatier roles, especially film.","I was the female lead in a romantic comedy. It's a little indie film that we shot in China called 'America Town,' starring Daniel Henney and Bill Paxton. I actually had to speak Chinese in the film. It was funny because I found out I was doing the film and then a week later, I was in Shanghai.","I definitely want to do more movies, and I'm also a writer, so I have a few screenplays that I'm working on, one of them based off my one-woman show that I used to do in New York. Two of the screenplays I've written by myself, and then I'm also working on one with my writing partner, Tom Riley, who's in London.","When I did 'Scrubs', we were able to always do one as scripted, and then we got to play a little bit and do some stuff. I thought that was pretty loose, but then coming on 'Happy Endings,' it's even looser.","If you have a strong sense of who you are and what you're doing, then it's actually easier to work with other people, because you don't have to worry about them or yourself. You're just worrying about getting the best product, and all that other stuff is out of the way.","I'd say I'm a pretty intense person. I'm definitely not my Denise character on 'Scrubs,' nor my Jane character on 'Happy Endings,' but I'm a mix of the two. I really feel that I'm kind of every character that I've ever played; it's just a part of me. And I am a bit of a control freak like Jane. I'm very, perhaps, obsessive like that.","I'm a kid from New Hampshire who's pretty normal.","There's such an odd, eclectic group of people that make up the town of Plymouth, New Hampshire. I don't think I could avoid not coming out of there with a pretty good sense of humor.","My older brother always tells me I changed as a person when I saw 'Ace Ventura.' Because when I saw 'Ace Ventura', I became obsessed. I watched the movie as many times as I had to - back then, you couldn't go on the Internet and find the script - so I watched it as many times as I could to write my own script of 'Ace Ventura.'","I was very disruptive. I was horrible. I didn't learn like all the other kids. I had to sometimes take my tests out in the hallways because I couldn't focus. But, my teachers would come see me in the plays and were like 'I don't understand how you can focus and be in the moment in a play and you go into math class and you can't focus.'","You can't improv off of bad writing. Then you have to actually create your objective, which is really hard to do in an element without the skeleton to go off of.","If I'm not clear with the character, I can't do anything with it. But once I get that character, the possibilities are endless. When you have such a defined character, I feel like I can actually read the phone book and make it funny.","I wish I knew that when I go in for an audition and I don't get the part, it actually doesn't have to do with me on a personal level.","Kids kill a show! It's, like, a fun concept when the character is pregnant, but then if a show runs for a while, I'm sorry, but it gets annoying when it starts to talk. You get a child actor in there, and unless that child actor is freakin' awesome, it's going to be annoying.","It's so funny, because when I was growing up in a small town in New Hampshire, I was obsessed with Leonardo DiCaprio - from the 'Growing Pains'/'What's Eating Gilbert Grape' era, because he was superhot - and I carried a laminated photo of him in my wallet and said he was my boyfriend. But no one believed me.","I still have a crush on Johnny Depp, and I literally only started dating my husband because he looked like Johnny Depp - and he knows that. We've been together for twelve years, and he still looks like Johnny Depp.","I'm always working out; I did ice hockey in high school, but I'm not a dance person. I mean, this was horrible, but I had a dance double in my high-school musical.","In college, I went to school for acting; we had to learn phonetics just to be able to do dialects and all that stuff. I'm somebody who does better just hearing it. I'll just imitate it, and I get it better that way. When I know too much information, I'm not great.","I used to play the piano by listening to it - like Chopin pieces, when I was, like, a little kid - and then the minute my parents got me lessons to read music, I couldn't do it anymore.","When you're walking around in Shanghai, I called it the City of Near Misses, because they do not stop for pedestrians. And the pedestrians do not have the right of way. It's those little things that no one tells you.","I do have a nickname with my family; I'm called Snappy, because I do get to be a bit snippy at times. They call me Snappy Bear. That's from New Hampshire. My dad's called Crazy, my mother's Happy - it's a whole thing.","TV is the best. I wish that's how life was.","My dad actually taught me to box when I was, like, nine years old, because I got picked on at school all of the time. I was on a boys' hockey team, so I would get all of my aggression out there.","I cannot feel my legs from the waist down any longer. But who cares? I look good and that's all that matters. And when I die of hypothermia for wearing formal shorts in winter, tell them to put that on my tombstone.","I don't want anyone to get seriously hurt. But I do watch awards shows to critique the clothes while I sit around eating chips in my sweat pants and in hopes of seeing some hilarious accidental nudity.","My hands are huge. When I was on 'Scrubs,' Zach Braff used to make fun of them all the time. And now I made some list. I guess Jennifer Garner is on the top of the list for best hands and I'm fourth down. But that's for people who really like an NBA star's hands.","I've been recognized a couple times. I get people staring at me, and I think in their heads they're thinking, 'How do I know her? Did I go to high school with her?' I think it's not registering yet.","I think the writers of 'Community' have moved on from my character. I'm pretty sure. I would love to go back on. I had a really good time and I really liked that character, but I don't think it's going to happen.","I would love to do a dramatic comedy. All of that, it all interests me. At some point I want to do my 'Monster,' like Charlize Theron, so I'm buckling up for that.","I try to be optimistic, but in this business it's so hard. The craziest stuff can happen.","I was on a show called '12 Miles of Bad Road' with Lily Tomlin - it was an incredible HBO show. We shot 6 episodes, previewed it before the finale of 'The Sopranos;' it was written up as a 'Great New Show on HBO,' and then the whole thing was canned. Gone. Disappeared. That's when I realized anything can happen in this business."],"Eliza Doolittle":["I don't really go out partying, but I'm definitely a social butterfly.","I think I'm generally an upbeat person. Obviously I can get moody, but my whole philosophy is to try and have a good time.","I like getting a tan, so if I'm lying on the beach, I want to get as much skin out as possible.","I don't prepare for wearing a bikini; I always have a bit of a tummy.","The only thing that holds true happiness is that moment when you're in it. Nothing can be controlled.","Young people, our rights and the things we care about, have been taken away because it doesn't really matter to the politicians whether or not we have them. We're just another demographic to try and please, but there's no point if we aren't voting.","When I was really little, I wanted to be a taxi driver or a bus driver; I loved the fact that I could play my own music when I wanted. But I can't imagine actually doing that now; I think I'd get bored.","The Beatles and Ray Charles were in the same charts together, and that was just called pop music - it wasn't called soul or rock. The best pop music just stands out as something that's just original, and I think it should all be called pop again.","Eliza was my first name for two reasons. My dad was reading 'Uncle Tom's Cabin,' which features the maid Eliza in it, when I was born. Then there was Eliza Doolittle from 'My Fair Lady' and 'Pygmalion.' My mum always loved the name, and I got called Eliza Doolittle a lot, so it stuck, basically.","There are lots of people whose style I admire, although I'd never dress like them. Chloe Sevigny is probably the most stylish woman ever, and Lady Gaga is amazing - it's fun to watch what she's going to wear next.","I'm a very visually motivated person. Music is always going to be the thing I'm most motivated by, but music and visuals go hand in hand.","You don't sell as many records as you used to because of illegal downloads, but I think there are other ways you can make money through your music. Whether it's through merchandise or teaming up with other companies or brands or whatever, there are ways.","I love' Les Mis,' and I owe it a lot, because I wouldn't have been born without it.","I haven't been watching any TV recently because I've been on the road, but I am an avid 'EastEnders' fan. I've watched it all my life, and so have my family.","I'm reading Sebastian Faulks's 'Birdsong' at the moment. I read it when I was younger but decided to re-read it, as I remembered really liking it at the time.","I'm interested in wartime stories, as I think it's important to remember what the soldiers went through.","I have always been a Peter Blake fan and love street art and graffiti. I really like this street-art collective called Faile. They're from Brooklyn and make these prints of beautiful women.","I love dressing up. As kids, my friends and I would dress up as the Spice Girls - Posh Spice was my favourite because I had short brown hair like her.","I like to wear colourful clothes because they make me feel happy: short-shorts with funky tights and big jumpers are what I'm into. And I wear most things with hi-top trainers - I'm not a huge fan of heels.","As soon as something becomes 'trendy,' I go off it. I hate the idea of being a sheep and just following a look because I've been told it's fashionable. Individuality makes the world a much more interesting place.","Lots of people, from what I can see, just want to get into the music business for the glamour of it. But there isn't any, really. It's so up and down this industry, but if you really love it, nothing can stop you.","My school was OK, but I just wanted to do music. I was a bit of a daydreamer. I wish I'd gone back and paid more attention.","I love shopping. I don't go on crazy 'I'm going shopping' sprees; I shop as I go along.","Fashion changes. Everyone in fashion changes. I think it's important to change it up and reinvent yourself every now and again.","I think that everyone in this world should be confident in who they are and believe in themselves no matter what.","I learnt that if I want to make any difference, or changes to my world, then I've got to be involved. We need passion - that's how things change.","I'm always writing; my phone is full of ideas - melodies and lyrics and stuff.","There is always one or a few artists who appeal to all sort of people, and, of course, I want to be one of those people.","My music is not a particular genre. It's not bubblegum or cheese. It's just good songs, pop songs. It's just my songs.","I don't like how women's bodies are Page 3 news. I just don't think that's big news. Women's bodies are women's bodies, and that's that. And I love to see beautiful - the female form in great art and great photography.","I'd love to work with Pharrell, but it's annoying because everyone is working with him now, and you don't want to be like, 'Oh, I want to work with you, too.' But he is the dream.","Experimenting with make-up is a lot of fun. When I'm not touring, I like nothing better than inviting the girls around to listen to music and get ready together before going out.","My friends will be like, 'That bloke was chatting you up', and I'll go, 'What?' I'm so oblivious - I don't notice things like that.","Constantly travelling means I don't always get to eat well - so it's probably a good idea for me to do some exercise.","I really don't think plastic surgery is a good idea. People who've had it done don't look younger or better, they just look like they've had plastic surgery.","My mum taught me that bodies are bodies, and they come in all shapes and sizes - we should be free about that. My legs are a bit dangly, and my knees point inwards. Everyone has insecurities, but I try not to focus on them. It's important to be confident with what you've got.","Every time I get photographed, it's the legs. So I've insured them for a lot, for £5 million each. Is that enough?","As a writer, I try to do different things, but I'm not going to become a darker artist or turn into Radiohead overnight. I don't think that's my style.","I've featured in some soundtracks in the past, and I would love to do more. I love great soundtracks to movies. Quentin Tarantino always picks amazing soundtracks, so I would like to do something for him or write a song for him.","I was always into pop music, Destiny's Child, songs with catchy music. Even when I was writing when I was younger, it wasn't all about expressing myself; it was just about making fun music.","Whenever people used to ask me what I wanted to be when I was older, I would always say that I wanted to be a singer. When I was 12, I decided I would do something about it, so I started writing songs.","I love lots of designers. I will always love Vivienne Westwood; she is a legendary designer.","I love Radiohead, which most people don't expect, and I listen to everything from Stevie Wonder to Steely Dan, Carole King, The Beach Boys, The Kinks, Beyonce Knowles, Vampire Weekend, The Beatles, Joni Mitchell, Burt Bacharach, and Paul Simon.","I never have regrets! What's the point?","I do embarrassing things all the time, but I don't really get embarrassed. It's like I'm unaware of my embarrassing things.","I think my parents did want me to go to university just in case, but neither my mum or dad went to uni, so they couldn't talk.","I tend to write at the piano, but usually the melody and lyrics come first. Like, I'll be in the shower, and I'll start singing, and the melody and the lyric will just come out. Then I'll quickly try to finish the shower, try to remember it, record it on my phone and save it for the studio.","I always loved singing. I was always trying to sing in school plays. I was in every one I could be in.","I always liked acting in school and drama classes, but when people asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up, I always told them I wanted to be a singer. I didn't want to be a jack of all trades. I wanted to master one.","I played Joseph in 'Joseph & The Technicolor Dreamcoat,' which was a bit silly because I am a girl. I wanted to be the narrator, but I had fun with it anyway.","I want to write songs people can sing along to. I can think of nothing more exciting than travelling the world and playing to audiences and having them sing your words along with you.","When I first played live, I would shake with fear, and my voice would tremble. But I do it for the love of it. There's nothing I love more than playing live.","I wasn't into sports when I was younger. I was one of those kids who always tried to get a note from the doctor to say I had a cold so I didn't have to go play hockey in bad weather and be miserable.","Doing gigs is great, but when you come together for a production in the theatre, that is something I have a lot of respect for.","I did try theatre out when I was little. I did roles as a child actress. My parents didn't push me into it. But I was up for it. I didn't enjoy doing eight shows a week, though. That repetitiveness didn't appeal to me. I love doing something different every day and travelling. You can't do that in the theatre.","I'm really into laces; I always accessorize with shoe laces whether I wear them as a belt, or attached to my shorts or in my hair or as a bracelet."],"Eliza Dushku":["I have nieces and nephews that I love hanging out with, and they think I'm the biggest goof on the planet.","Go big or go home. Because it's true. What do you have to lose?","I like to have one night on the weekend where I can just cuddle up at my house.","I wake up and play a different person every day. Playing all these different characters and trying to figure out who your true authentic self is at the core of that as you're playing all these different roles, and man, that self-awareness starts to come into effect. And you start to see who you really are.","My mom grew up in Idaho, went to Brigham Young University: they're very Molly Mormon. And my father is, like, first generation Albanian, and his parents lived in Southey and grew up in downtown Boston. My parents are complete opposites.","My mom is this liberal, feminist, Mormon powerhouse. I just love her to death.","I'm self-confident and not afraid to speak my mind.","I was raised in Boston by three older brothers and a very strong and empowering single mom.","I don't care who you are, everyone has been through it - that feeling where you'd like to be someone else.","There is definitely something sexy about a girl with an attitude and a pair of leather pants.","When you get to your mid-20s, you start to feel responsibilities for the things that you do and the people around you. It's a cool age.","When I worked with Jamie Lee Curtis in 'True Lies', she told me, You need a plan B, because when you have six months to a year off, you can go nuts. You need to have another focus.","We didn't have a TV in the living room and all my friends thought we were kind of weird. When they'd come over, my mom wanted to talk to them about current events.","TV can be a long commitment.","The letters from jail are always disconcerting.","My parents divorced when I was born, and my mother is a political science professor, like a feminist Mormon, which is sort of an oxymoron.","My mother would take groups of students to different countries and always brought us along, so by the time I was 10, I had been to Russia, China, Nicaragua and several other countries.","It's easy to play a bad girl: You just do everything you've been told not to do, and you don't have to deal with the consequences, because it's only acting.","In my first movie, That Night, with Juliette Lewis, I had a scene with two other girls where we applied a cream to our chests to make our breasts grow. I was 10.","If I wasn't doing this, I'd be in school studying political science or socioeconomic something. I love visiting different cultures and finding out how they make up a society.","I'm a more mature actress now.","I remember hitting Sarah Michelle Gellar with a right hook during my first week on the job. It was awful. They usually pair actors with stunt doubles to avoid things like that.","I don't let guys do hickeys. That's like a dog marking his territory or something.","For the longest time, I thought I was a boy. I really did. I wore boys' clothes, played tag football.","Each year, I say I'm going to go to school next year. It's inevitable that I'll end up getting my education.","There are a lot of actresses out there who are the girl next door. I relate more to characters who have an edge.","You know, I really am probably one of the sweetest, most sensitive people you'll ever meet.","Growing up I was as big a tomboy as you can get.","Well, when I moved to L.A. at 17, I had just come out of high school. I grew up and went to public school in Boston.","My mom is like this hard-core, liberal feminist. She's a professor in Boston, and she's been teaching women's studies for 30 years and international politics.","I wanted to be a political science professor and go to school in Boston. I never wanted to be a big, famous movie star and TV star. It kind of found me.","I literally remember when I made my audition tape for 'Buffy'. I went to the Arsenal Mall. I got my outfit at Contempo Casuals in the Arsenal Mall and put some safety pins in my jeans. I remember telling whoever the clerk was that I was making a tape for 'Buffy', and they were so excited.","I joined the Twitterverse in the second season of 'Dollhouse.' Friends that I admire were already in that space, like Kevin Smith.","I love the physical roles. I have the utmost respect for stunt people and stunt doubles, but I like to do as much as I possibly can with what's become some pretty significant training.","I really admire the way the fans have joined me in social justice endeavours and the charitable work that I've been involved in. We've raised over $100,000 on Twitter for our non-profit in Uganda.","I think people hear and feel the genuine nature of my passion for the causes. Specifically, with the non-profit in Uganda, my mother is the president, and she was an African politics professor for almost 50 years, so I think people know that I align myself with people who know what they're talking about.","I receive really powerful personal letters. I think that always takes the cake. It blows me away... some of the comments. Someone will come and I sense their whole tone and energy when they're handing me this letter.","After I graduated high school and came out to do 'Buffy,' I was enrolled at my mom's university, and I was going to go get a real job. I never thought of acting and never really wanted to be an actor.","I purely attribute my 'hamming it up' quality to growing up with three older brothers and just being like a tomboy my whole life. Literally, my mother had to be like, 'Honey, there's a certain point where you have to start wearing a shirt.' You know, I would run around with the boys and play tag football and climb trees.","I think I really thought I was a boy until I was ten years old because my parents divorced when I was born, and so my three brothers were almost like my fathers growing up. So they taught me how to ride a bike and all that stuff. I really was just kind of a guy's girl and just kind of an outspoken - some could say obnoxious - in-your-face kid.","I have been doing this since I was 10 years old. It wasn't like I was an overnight hit. I think when that happens to some actors - they just don't know what to do with themselves. You don't know how to cope with friends and all of a sudden not being able to go out. It's such a shock to your system.","I remember having a Mike Tyson T-shirt back in the day that I used to sleep in. And there some things that Tyson did along the way that I wasn't too psyched to associate myself with. But back in the day, just as a fighter, what a dream that was to watch and root for him.","Usually, when you do video games, you don't interact with the other actors. You each record your audio on different days, and you never really meet the other characters.","I cannot watch my own dailies, ever. I'm my worst critic. It distracts me. I can watch it when it's done, but I'm not the girl that wants to run back and look at the performance."],"Eliza Farnham":["The human face is the organic seat of beauty. It is the register of value in development, a record of Experience, whose legitimate office is to perfect the life, a legible language to those who will study it, of the majestic mistress, the soul.","The ultimate aim of the human mind, in all its efforts, is to become acquainted with Truth.","Our own theological Church, as we know, has scorned and vilified the body till it has seemed almost a reproach and a shame to have one, yet at the same time has credited it with power to drag the soul to perdition.","Each of the Arts whose office is to refine, purify, adorn, embellish and grace life is under the patronage of a Muse, no god being found worthy to preside over them."],"Eliza Haywood":["Of all the Beauties, it is that which attracts the most lasting Admiration, gives the greatest Charm to every thing we say or do, and renders us amiable in every Station, and thro' every Stage of Life.","The Unhappy may, possibly, by indulging Thought, hit on some lucky Stratagem for the Relief of his Misfortunes, and the Happy may be infinitely more so by contemplating on his Condition.","There is one Quality, which has somewhat so heavenly in it; that by so much the more we are possess'd of it, by so much the more we draw nearer to the Great Author of Nature.","To know ourselves, is agreed by all to be the most useful Learning; the first Lessons, therefore, given us ought to be on that Subject."],"Eliza Taylor":["Being on Twitter and social media, you obviously get to see a lot more of what people are thinking of you and of your show.","I started on 'Neighbours' when I was 14. It's crazy to think now that I had such a bizarre adolescence.","I was always on set, I was always working, so my study was down to the bare minimum required. So I am one of the few who didn't study 'Lord of the Flies.'"],"Elizabeth A. Sherman":["Now that the day of reckoning has arrived, they cry socialism!","It's not about Obama, it's about the Democrats and their policies that cause consternation on the right.","American presidents always avoid shaking hands with brutal dictators, except when it's advantageous to do so."],"Elizabeth Appell":["And the day came when the risk to remain tight in a bud was more painful than the risk it took to blossom."],"Elizabeth Arden":["Repetition makes reputation and reputation makes customers.","I only want people around me who can do the impossible.","Every woman has the right to be beautiful.","I pick good women, but I haven't had any luck with my men.","Nothing that costs only a dollar is not worth having.","There's only one Elizabeth like me and that's the Queen.","Dear, never forget one little point. It's my business. You just work here.","Hold fast to life and youth.","Hold fast to youth and beauty."],"Elizabeth Ashley":["Absence does not make the heart grow fonder, but it sure heats up the blood.","The only thing I like about being an actress is acting.","In a great romance, each person basically plays a part that the other really likes."],"Elizabeth Banks":["Someone told me that having a baby is like having your heart walking around outside of your body, and I didn't understand it until I had a baby. Now, like, everything he does literally crushes my heart. In a great way. And then if he's in pain, it's like my whole endeavor is to make sure he's not in pain.","It's okay to lose. Losing teaches you something. Having to try and going through the trials and tribulations to actually overcome, to get there to win, to triumph, that's what makes life interesting.","I am not afraid of much. I kill all the spiders in my house, and I'm planning to go skydiving. I am into girl power, and I'm very self-sufficient.","One predictor for divorce is contempt, which to me is just another word for disrespect.","The only reason ever to make a sequel is to spend more time with the characters that people love: to tell more of their story.","I can hang with the dudes because I love beef and baseball and driving fast and flirting. I understand where men are coming from, and I'm interested in typically male endeavors. But I can also wear the short skirt and cheerlead.","Klutziness is endearing. I like imperfection.","I'm very genetically blessed; I cannot deny it, but I work hard at keeping myself together. Yes, I have nice cheekbones and skinny legs, but I can't take any credit for it.","I'm not a fan of plastic surgery. Oh, and I've never had a wax in my life. Waxing makes no sense to me because you have to grow it out to wax it.","Predicting what content is going to fly is like looking into a crystal ball. I try not to say, 'Yeah, 'Bridesmaids' opened the door to make more movies about women.' I mean, did it? I don't know; where are they?","I'm not a particularly shiny, happy person. I'm fairly cynical, and that's what draws me to comedy.","I love stories about misfits and underdogs.","'Thank you' is often an admission that you needed something that wasn't being fulfilled or you couldn't do on your own, so you needed someone else. There is also guilt. We think, 'Well, too much time has gone by, and it doesn't matter,' but it does. It always matters.","Normally for photo shoots I get a full wax, some tanning, a facial.","My favorite event each year is the Yankees-Red Sox series. Love seeing passions run hot among the fans, especially when both teams are in the running for the playoffs.","I secretly harbor the fantasy of becoming an action star at any moment. I know I'd be great at it.","I really find that when I get on an airplane, I never drink anything but water, and I drink a ton of it. I like to sit in the window, but I'm always climbing over people to go to the bathroom. I'm that seatmate. But ya gotta do it. All about the water.","I think comedy has to be very fearless, or it just gets bland.","I'm a good role model. I have an amazing marriage, and it will be long lasting. I think I'm a good mom. I could run for office, no problem, because there are no skeletons in my closet.","My acting gives me my self-worth.","You have got to have an agent. It's a business. But I think there is a way to be artful and commercial at the same time.","If I ever complain about yachting around the Mediterranean with Madonna, who I just idolized as a child, I should be slapped across the face.","I love working with a stylist but I also love having personal relationships with designers. A stylist is great for pulling together an entire outfit, accessories included, and for shaking me out of my comfort zone.","I like my coffee light.","I actually think that secrets are just a part of human nature and that everybody should have some.","When I was in college I was accused of being a goody two-shoes. But every goody two-shoes has a bad side.","I play Rock Band, which is Guitar Hero times ten. You can play with four people, so when you have parties, you have a real band. Nobody ever wants to sing, so I'm always the one throwing down on the mic.","Most men I know rely on women to do all the literal dirty work.","I love physical comedy. I love Oscar Wilde, I love Shakespeare comedies, I love improv.","Every once in a while I play a true idiot, and they're really fun to play.","When you live in a leading lady's body, which I do, you have to constantly prove that you are funny.","Some big actresses told me a few things that inspired me. One said that the biggest challenge for a female actress was to make sure they are not profoundly bored. Another told me to just do whatever you want - do anything.","I don't stay in my trailer. I like to sit in video village, probably to the annoyance of some producers and directors, because they really love to talk about actors, and they can't in front of me.","I like entertaining people. I want to make big entertainment.","No matter what, I'm in a very small club. There are very few women who have directed studio-level commercial films - very few.","The sexism in Hollywood is not particularly overt - because the system is good at hiding it.","I went to a few really bad commercial auditions because I needed the money, and when you booked a commercial, your life was made: you could eat.","Violence against women is real and something I feel passionately about, and the gateway to all that is wolf whistling. It's allowing a man to impose his will on a woman who is just trying to walk down the street and live her life. It's all about unwanted versus wanted attention, and, of course, there's a fine line.","Honestly, I am hoping to influence young people, and Twitter's a great way to encourage them to lend their voice to the conversation. Any time you can show young people that you support gay friends and that there are gay people in the world who are lovely, happy, singing, and in love, it opens their minds.","I grew up in a very small town, but it happened to be in western Massachusetts, where there were a lot of gay people. I remember my aunt going to a gay wedding when I was 11, and I thought it was the coolest thing.","I have a gay cousin who came out to my parents before he came out to his own. So I benefited from having a very open, supportive family, and I want to pass that on.","I went to drama school. I'm classically trained; I studied Shakespeare, blah blah blah. But I always preferred to do Oscar Wilde, or Shakespeare's comedies over his dramas.","What I love about Twitter specifically is that reciprocity is not guaranteed, nor expected. In other words, I can go one way. I can put things out. I don't have to respond to everybody.","The great thing about Twitter is, you get a lot back, and I read through a lot, and I want my fans to know that I do read a lot, and it's why I do respond or retweet clever posts, and I'm constantly amazed by the cleverness of people on Twitter.","I think people respond to me as a down-to-Earth, girl-next-door person, because I am one of those people. That's something I don't have to act very hard at.","Producing never stops. It's 24/7.","I try not to repeat myself too often, but it's a gamble. 'Fred Claus' had three Oscar winners in it. No business - it was a bad movie.","I didn't quite believe I was pretty for a long time. I never thought about it.","I suppose the best advice I ever got, frankly the advice that changed my life, came from my uncle who told me to go to drama school and study acting instead of taking a job, because he said the job would always be there.","I love improv. I do it with my co-star John Michael Higgins in both 'Pitch Perfect' films.","I played softball. I was on an all-star team. I traveled with the team. I loved it.","I had an audition for Mary Jane Watson in 'Spiderman' and ended up playing Betty Brant in that series. I auditioned for Amy Adams' role in 'Catch Me If You Can' and, you know, ended up playing the bank teller. So there were a lot of times early on where I felt like I was always sort of the bridesmaid, never the bride - never quite right.","I grew up sort of lower working class. And I just didn't want to have the money struggles that my parents had. You know, I could just - as loving an environment I grew up in - and I grew up in a great home, a very loving home - but, you know, we had that stress. We had that stress in our life.","Sometimes I'm sexy, and sometimes I'm not.","I do try to eat healthy, and I find that's easiest when I just avoid the Doritos aisle at the grocery store.","I do this system called TRX. It was developed by a Navy SEAL and is basically a simple cord that you can wrap around something anywhere, anytime, and you use your body weight as resistance. We installed one in our home gym, but you can also attach it to a tree. It's very easy to travel with.","I'm a physical comedian, and I don't get to show it off very often.","All through my twenties, I lived in very walkable cities - Philadelphia, San Francisco, and New York.","I'm afraid of a cappella. I don't read music, and I have a hard time harmonizing. Basically, I'm a melody singer only.","'Pitch Perfect 2,' those scenes are super fun. It's just me and John Michael Higgins, and we've been friends for so long, we just have the best time. Anything I do with him is some of my favorite stuff.","I have such a respect for comedy. It's a lot harder than doing drama, in my opinion; you have to have sort of an innate sense of humor. There are rules to comedy you can learn. But ultimately, it really does require a certain point of view on the world, and that really does appeal to me.","When I was coming up, it was the golden age. It was Julia Roberts and Meg Ryan, and Reese Witherspoon was starting. You really had, 'Who is America's Next Sweetheart?' every couple of years. And then this sort of bromance slacker thing took over.","'Hunger Games' is a tried-and-true tale about a totalitarian society. It's more similar to China than America, but it's also similar to Nazi Germany and anywhere where the populace gets semi-brainwashed into serving the agenda of a very few.","I directed plays in college. It's something that I have sort of always put in the back of my mind, and I'm a busy actress, and it's very difficult to sort of find the time, honestly, to commit to directing. It's a very - it's a big, big job.","These properties that get made into movies, some are easier than others. When they first said, 'Yeah, they're making a movie out of Lego,' I said, 'Lego what? What does that even mean?' And it's such a good concept.","I hope I'm Jessica Tandy, you know. I hope I'm onstage, and I fall over at 85 or something with everyone applauding thinking that it was a joke, you know, 'There she goes again,' and I'm just gone. I've gone to Heaven.","Your funny gets developed pretty early on. Comedy requires that you understand as much as possible about the viewpoints of all people and everything that's going on around you. It genuinely requires a true point of view, a real sense of your own view of things in the world.","Comedy often comes at the expense of others, and to do that smartly, you don't want to make fun of vulnerable people. You want to make fun of people in power, and so you need to really understand the dynamics of power.","It's not good to put in a magazine what I weigh because it's too little. People freak out when they hear what I weigh. They think, 'Oh, you're too skinny.'","I love Prada shoes. I cannot get enough of them. Or Valentino.","I have very fond memories of the Eagles from my experience with 'Invincible' and my college days in Philadelphia. But I am a Massachusetts girl and a Pats fan.","I work out with our trainer, Jocelynne Boschen of Alpha Sport L.A., hike a lot, and eat healthy. I love cooking so prepare a lot of my own food and avoid processed foods. No fast food. No soda.","My father is a huge horse racing fan, so I was introduced to the sport long before 'Seabiscuit.' But the role made me an even bigger fan. Horse racing is one of my favorite sports.","I think the hardcore fans can expect exactly what both 'The Hunger Games' and 'Catching Fire' delivered: 'Mockingjay' is going to be as faithful a rendition of Suzanne's Collins's world and books and characters as we can put out!","I was an early adopter of the 'Hunger Games.' I read them before they were best sellers - I was on the pre-order wait list for 'Mockingjay' on Amazon.","Portion control is a real problem. My husband and I always split one appetizer and one entree. I'm sure waiters hate us.","I only know the lyrics to songs that I listened to between the ages of 11 and 15.","My father always made an amazing meatloaf, and I've inherited his skill. Leftover meatloaf in a sandwich? Come on!","I've learned all my hair and makeup tricks on the set, and I incorporate all kinds of things when I'm getting ready, and I'm big on blotting papers. I get a very shiny forehead, which I like to call my inner glow coming out.","When you have one kid, you feel like you can jet set around, and you can throw him on the hip, and you get your life done. You don't realize how easy one is until you have two. Now I'm really a mom. Oh, I am a mom now! This is for serious - I am responsible for two people now."],"Elizabeth Barrett Browning":["You were made perfectly to be loved - and surely I have loved you, in the idea of you, my whole life long.","I love thee to the depth and breadth and height my soul can reach.","How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.","Who so loves believes the impossible.","Earth's crammed with heaven, And every common bush afire with God: But only he who sees takes off his shoes.","Smiles, tears, of all my life! - and, if God choose, I shall but love thee better after death.","God's gifts put man's best dreams to shame.","What is genius but the power of expressing a new individuality?","He said true things, but called them by wrong names.","Light tomorrow with today!","And each man stands with his face in the light. Of his own drawn sword, ready to do what a hero can.","If thou must love me, let it be for naught except for love's sake only.","Girls blush, sometimes, because they are alive, half wishing they were dead to save the shame. The sudden blush devours them, neck and brow; They have drawn too near the fire of life, like gnats, and flare up bodily, wings and all. What then? Who's sorry for a gnat or girl?","What I do and what I dream include thee, as the wine must taste of its own grapes.","But the child's sob curses deeper in the silence than the strong man in his wrath!","World's use is cold, world's love is vain, world's cruelty is bitter bane; but is not the fruit of pain.","God answers sharp and sudden on some prayers, And thrusts the thing we have prayed for in our face, A gauntlet with a gift in it.","At painful times, when composition is impossible and reading is not enough, grammars and dictionaries are excellent for distraction.","How many desolate creatures on the earth have learnt the simple dues of fellowship and social comfort, in a hospital.","The Greeks said grandly in their tragic phrase, 'Let no one be called happy till his death;' to which I would add, 'Let no one, till his death, be called unhappy.'","An ignorance of means may minister to greatness, but an ignorance of aims make it impossible to be great at all.","A woman is always younger than a man at equal years.","First time he kissed me, he but only kissed The fingers of this hand wherewith I write; And, ever since, it grew more clean and white.","If you desire faith, then you have faith enough.","Suddenly, as rare things will, it vanished.","Since when was genius found respectable?","He lives most life whoever breathes most air.","The beautiful seems right by force of beauty and the feeble wrong because of weakness.","For tis not in mere death that men die most."],"Elizabeth Barton":["I hold communications with saints and angels, even with satan himself.","Attacks of divine transports are of pride and I accept the part assigned."],"Elizabeth Berkley":["I typically enjoy a beautiful beach destination, as I find the water and sand to be the most replenishing.","I will never forget experiencing Venice for the first time. It feels like you are transported to another time - the art, music, food and pure romance in the air is like no other place.","Everyone just talks about the problems our teenage girls are facing and what they're dealing with. But there was, to me, a void in how they were being served or helped. I thought, 'Wow, I'd love to create something.'","I'm no expert standing at a podium giving speeches. I share heartbeats. Compassion.","I'd love to play a rock star in a movie, but for now, I'm not performing in public.","Girls' inner critics are starting to reveal themselves at a younger and younger age. And body image issues are an aspect of their lives which is causing them low self esteem and day-to-day suffering.","One thing I've learned: My intentions are clear in terms of quality.","I noticed that no matter where I went in the country, there was this group of questions that got asked. I would track them and keep them in categories. Like body image, school, family, friendship, you name it, the emotional life of a teenage girl.","My mission is to give girls the tools to be able to blossom into their best selves.","I had to work out where I was going, what type of films I wanted to make. For that reason, I decided to choose independent productions, less important roles, and I tried theater, too.","I had to make some drastic choices to avoid losing myself.","I get enough sleep. I take very good care of myself. Growing up as a dancer, you know your body so well, you know what to do to overcome something.","I will say a lot of dancers do such beautiful things for their body and then they smoke a cigarette. I've never been a smoker, but I realized after taking yoga . . . in ballet you're not encouraged to do a lot of breathing. I think in a weird way, a lot of dancers find relief in actually breathing.","I was raised really, really healthy, pretty much vegetarian and a very clean lifestyle, I don't smoke, I don't drink. I'm more addicted to the things that make me feel good - endorphins after working out.","For me, as an actress, being a dancer has helped me. I've done it with my feet bloody.","I just love creating an environment where people can open up and say what's on their mind and in their heart.","You have to be a little crazy to be a dancer.","No one can hand you anything as a dancer. You have to earn it.","There's some great women doing TV. I would love to do a Grey's Anatomy-type show. I'm a big fan.","Having gone through so many of the personal things I've gone through, its about creating an (online) space for girls to be heard. I don't profess to have all the answers. But Ask Elizabeth is a space where girls are not alone.","Girls are so often pitted against each other as enemies or adversaries. We even see it in 'Us' magazine: Who wore it better?","We're not excusing the ones who are mean, but I want girls to understand the psychology. It's not in everyone. But the bully needs to put this pain somewhere.","'Showgirls' was a critical point in my life. I had my head handed to me. At 21 years old, I had to find my self-esteem again. It was a very hard time.","I tell girls, 'If you're tall and feel too tall, the answer is to be taller.'","I needed to find my own worth and shake the image after having done 'Showgirls' at age 21.","No movie influenced me more to go after my dreams than 'Flashdance.' After seeing it, I took 15 dance lessons a week. I cut all my sweatshirts. I did the 'Maniac' thing.","I love to sing. Mostly about love and sex.","In singing, there's a vibration that comes from deep down inside, literally from your sex. When you put out that vibration, people can feel it. Billie Holiday does it. Peggy Lee does it. It's very hot.","No one goes unscathed, we all go through things. We just can't let people's nasty words become our beliefs about ourselves, you know?","I think often times when people choose to be part of a charity; it's usually because something is very personal.","Ask Elizabeth is a community of voices, it's not me standing on a podium telling people how to run their lives, it's girls helping each other sharing their wisdom and advice and I create a space for them to do it.","I don't think people have seen yet what I can really do. Only appetizers!","One of my favorite tools is 'flip it.' 'Flip it' can become your new favorite mantra when you are having one of those mean thoughts. You can choose to flip it and change how you are feeling about yourself in that moment. This is helpful at any age."],"Elizabeth Bibesco":["Blessed are those who give without remembering and take without forgetting.","There is something very independent about French balloons - you feel you couldn't make a pet of one.","Happiness is a light, an atmosphere, an illumination. It sets a personality. I always feel that it is a creation that is difficult for some and easy for others, but essentially an achievement, never an accident.","Irony is the hygiene of the mind.","All my life, I have loved balloons - all balloons - the heavy English sort, immense and round, that have to be pushed about, and the gay, light, gas-filled French ones that soar into the air the moment you let go of them.","To some people, the impossible is impossible. One fine day, they wake up in the morning knowing that they will never hold the moon in their hands, and with the certainty, perfect peace descends on them.","Oh, youth is a wicked, cruel thing - eating miracles with its breakfast and not knowing they are not porridge.","Seeing through is rarely seeing into.","To others we are not ourselves but performers in their lives cast for a part we do not even know we are playing.","Can one end anything? A chapter, a paragraph, a sentence even? Doesn't everything one has ever done go on living in spite of subsequent events?","What you possess is not what you jingle in the pockets of your memory, but the imaginings with which you fill the spaces of the future.","Only the artists interest me whose hearts beat in unison with the poignant misery of the world. If you have not felt that, you have not lived. Pity is essential.","It is sometimes the man who opens the door who is the last to enter the room.","We often call a certainty a hope, to bring it luck.","It is better not to sit on the grass after thirty when sprawling at all is difficult, let alone sprawling gracefully.","I do not know at what moment in life, if ever, we realise that we are neither George Sands nor Juliets. Of course, if we are not beautiful, we recognise early that beauty is nothing.","The only thing that matters is to have charm and expression. Then comes that horrible gnawing doubt of our own magnetism. Is it possible that, though we are not lovely, we are not irresistible either? That we will have to go through life belonging neither to the triumphantly beautiful nor to the triumphantly ugly?","What an uncertain thing, marriage - what an elusive thing, happiness!","Friendship is a difficult, dangerous job. It is also (though we rarely admit it) extremely exhausting.","There is nothing in the world like health. Live cleanly, and the high thinking will look after itself - or at least won't matter. Physical condition - there's nothing like it.","The half-hour of crowded anticipation, how fully it pays for the sterile hour that follows!","A man who is available for lunch, has no wife, is interested in everything, and talks well is socially invaluable.","Passion is no respecter of persons. She hardly seems to select her victims.","Isn't that what love means, to fill ordinary, commonplace, conventional things with magic and significance, not to need the moon and white scent-heavy flowers at night?","What is it one yearns for? It is to be able to do a thing for the first time again. And that is impossible.","Why don't people take the trouble to let you know that they are alive? It is so much more important. The whole system is wrong. No sooner do I die, than all the flowers I have ever longed for in life pour in."],"Elizabeth Bishop":["The art of losing isn't hard to master; so many things seem filled with the intent to be lost that their loss is no disaster.","What childishness is it that while there's breath of life in our bodies, we are determined to rush to see the sun the other way around?","All my life I have lived and behaved very much like the sandpiper - just running down the edges of different countries and continents, 'looking for something'.","The armored cars of dreams, contrived to let us do so many a dangerous thing.","The pigs stuck out their little feet and snored.","The whole shadow of Man is only as big as his hat."],"Elizabeth Blackburn":["Biology sometimes reveals its fundamental principles through what may seem at first to be arcane and bizarre.","I've only actively promoted what we always hope is good science.","This enzyme, called telomerase, slows the rate at which telomeres degrade, and research indicates that healthy people with longer telomeres have less risk of developing the common illnesses of aging - like heart disease, diabetes, and cancer, which are three big killers today.","Ageing is so many different things, and cells being able to self-renew is part of the picture but not all of it.","Tracing the beginnings of the interwoven stories of science can be arbitrary, as beginnings are so often lost in the mists of time.","Telomeres are the protective caps at the ends of chromosomes in cells. Chromosomes carry the genetic information. Telomeres are buffers. They are like the tips of shoelaces. If you lose the tips, the ends start fraying.","Being senior enough in the field, having enough solidity, I don't feel afraid of being marginalized.","Challenges in medicine are moving from 'Treat the symptoms after the house is on fire' to 'Can we preserve the house intact?'","Studying organisms at a molecular level was totally compelling because it was moving from being a naturalist, which was the 19th-century kind of science, to being very focused and really getting to the heart of these molecules.","I was born in the small city of Hobart in Tasmania, Australia, in 1948. My parents were family physicians. My grandfather and great grandfather on my mother's side were geologists.","Medicine has been successful by treating diseases in a very specific way once the damage is done. But telomere length integrates a lot of factors together and gives you an overall picture of risk for what is now emerging as a lot of diseases that tend to occur together, such as diabetes and heart disease.","We think there are lifestyle factors that boost telomerase naturally.","I spent my first 4 years living in the tiny town of Snug, by the sea near Hobart. Curious about animals, I would pick up ants in our backyard and jellyfish on the beach.","Perhaps arising from a fascination with animals, biology seemed the most interesting of sciences to me as a child.","I chose biochemistry as my major and graduated after 4 years with an Honours degree in Biochemistry. During that time, I had come to love biochemistry research, although I was just getting my feet wet in laboratory research.","For me, arguably the story of telomeres and telomerase began thousands of years ago, in the cornfields of the Maya highlands of Central America.","As maize became important for human food worldwide, modern agricultural research on maize breeding continued the corn breeding begun thousands of years ago in the Central American highlands.","In my early work, our molecular views of telomeres were first focused on the DNA.","I was using very unconventional methods to sequence the telemetric DNA, originally.","What is it that keeps you so interested in the telomere? It's so intricate and complicated, and you want to know how it works.","Generally, we try to have a situation where the person is healthy, so you're not confounded by disease. So, that means that healthy individuals are donating their blood samples for the studies.","In my lab, we're finding that psychological stress actually ages cells, which can be seen when you measure the wearing down of the tips of the chromosomes, those telomeres.","Researchers have found that the brain definitely sends nerves directly to organs of the immune system and not just to the heart and the lower gut. In that way, too, the brain is influencing the body.","In the 1970s, I did a Ph.D. with Fred Sanger in Cambridge who was in the process of inventing ways to map what's inside DNA. He later won the Nobel Prize.","We and other groups are seeing clear statistical links between telomere shortness and risk for a variety of diseases that are becoming very common, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes and certain cancers.","The conservative statement is that telomere length is a biomarker, but it's probably not passive. There are some very intimate relationships between things such as molecular markers for inflammation and telomere health.","When scientists get old, they get interested in the brain, and I'm a little bit afraid I'm falling into that.","No one ever said, 'Be a doctor.' But because so many members of my extended family - aunts, uncles - were doctors, there was this expectation that I'd probably be a physician.","I decided I wanted to go to Cambridge, and then I got introduced to Fred Sanger. I was very conscientious, and I asked him when I first got there if I should start reading up on things. But he said, 'No, I think you can just start these experiments,' so I plunged right in.","At Cambridge, there was a completely unintimidating culture, and there were no class divisions among the students.","Exercise mitigates the effects of stress - and stress, we know, shortens telomeres. In fact, early studies indicate that stress reduction techniques like meditation help people maintain the length of their telomeres.","I'm pretty good about getting some exercise every day - well, most days. The secret for me was to put the elliptical in front of the TV.","Basically, when you look at different types of cells, such as fibroblasts, which form connective tissue, or epithelial cells, from saliva, you see general correlations within a person. If telomeres are up for one cell type, they're up for others overall.","We're involved in a very large study that's federally funded and being done with Kaiser Permanente, and saliva is a very non-invasive way to get cells from the body.","We're collecting about 100,000 telomere lengths in saliva samples and then looking at how those relate to both the extensive longitudinal clinical records that Kaiser is collecting and the genome sequence variations.","If we think of our chromosomes - they carry our genetic material - as being like shoelaces, I work on the plastic tips at the end that protect them.","Observational studies show that exercise, nutritional supplements and reducing psychological stress can help. Chronic high stress and smoking can lead to accelerated telomere shortening.","Checking your telomere length is a bit like weighing yourself: you get this single number which depends on a lot of factors. Telomere length gives a sense of your underlying health.","In 2004, results from a study that I worked on with colleagues at the University of California, San Francisco, linked chronic stress to shortening of telomeres.","If a test showed you had telomere shortening, it would be a red flag suggesting you should take a look at possible risk factors.","The goal is to learn more about telomere length and other markers of ageing, how best to measure these markers, how they are related to health and lifestyle, and how people respond to learning their own telomere length results.","In humans, the thing is that as we mature, our telomeres slowly wear down. So the question has always been: 'Did that matter?' Well, more and more, it seems like it matters.","Cancer cells have had so many other things go wrong with them, genetic, non-genetic changes, that those cells, one of the things they then get selected for is that they have lots of telomerase because now the telomeres in those cells get maintained.","One characteristic aspect of ageing is the increased susceptibility to disease, particularly age-related diseases such as cardiovascular diseases and cancer.","Cancer cells have a lot of other things that are really wrong with them, and we should never forget that these are cells that have become deaf to all the signals that the body sends out, such as you can multiply a certain amount, you can be in a certain place in the body, where to stay, where to move, and so on.","When you bring telomerase RNA levels down by using a mechanism that targets the RNA for destruction, the cells which were running on very high telomerase levels are now running on a lean diet of telomerase.","The most dangerous cancer cells are actually the ones that are more like stem cells, which have this ability to produce themselves over and over again. More and more cancer biologists say stem-cell-like cells in cancers are the most dangerous."],"Elizabeth Blackwell":["The idea of winning a doctor's degree gradually assumed the aspect of a great moral struggle, and the moral fight possessed immense attraction for me.","A blank wall of social and professional antagonism faces the woman physician that forms a situation of singular and painful loneliness, leaving her without support, respect or professional counsel.","It is not easy to be a pioneer - but oh, it is fascinating! I would not trade one moment, even the worst moment, for all the riches in the world.","I must have something to engross my thoughts, some object in life which will fill this vacuum, and prevent this sad wearing away of the heart.","If society will not admit of woman's free development, then society must be remodeled.","Our school education ignores, in a thousand ways, the rules of healthy development."],"Elizabeth Bowen":["No object is mysterious. The mystery is your eye.","Jealousy is no more than feeling alone against smiling enemies.","Autumn arrives in early morning, but spring at the close of a winter day.","Fate is not an eagle, it creeps like a rat.","Nobody can be kinder than the narcissist while you react to life in his own terms.","Education is not so important as people think.","Art is one thing that can go on mattering once it has stopped hurting.","When you love someone all your saved up wishes start coming out.","The wish to lead out one's lover must be a tribal feeling; the wish to be seen as loved is part of one's self-respect.","It is not helpful to help a friend by putting coins in his pockets when he has got holes in his pockets.","The best that an individual can do is to concentrate on what he or she can do, in the course of a burning effort to do it better.","If a theme or idea is too near the surface, the novel becomes simply a tract illustrating an idea.","Silences have a climax, when you have got to speak.","Never to lie is to have no lock on your door, you are never wholly alone.","We are minor in everything but our passions.","Nobody speaks the truth when there is something they must have.","Intimacies between women often go backwards, beginning in revelations and ending in small talk.","One can live in the shadow of an idea without grasping it.","There is no end to the violations committed by children on children, quietly talking alone.","The heart may think it knows better: the senses know that absence blots people out. We really have no absent friends.","Experience isn't interesting until it begins to repeat itself. In fact, till it does that, it hardly is experience.","All your youth you want to have your greatness taken for granted; when you find it taken for granted, you are unnerved.","Who is ever adequate? We all create situations each other can't live up to, then break our hearts at them because they don't.","Language is a mixture of statement and evocation.","If you look at life one way, there is always cause for alarm.","Pity the selfishness of lovers: it is brief, a forlorn hope; it is impossible.","Illusions are art, for the feeling person, and it is by art that we live, if we do.","That is partly why women marry - to keep up the fiction of being in the hub of things.","Mechanical difficulties with language are the outcome of internal difficulties with thought.","The innocent are so few that two of them seldom meet - when they do meet, their victims lie strewn all round.","Meeting people unlike oneself does not enlarge one's outlook; it only confirms one's idea that one is unique.","I think the main thing, don't you, is to keep the show on the road.","I became, and remain, my characters' close and intent watcher: their director, never. Their creator I cannot feel that I was, or am.","Nothing can happen nowhere. The locale of the happening always colours the happening, and often, to a degree, shapes it.","Ireland is a great country to die or be married in.","The importance to the writer of first writing must be out of all proportion of the actual value of what is written.","Fantasy is toxic: the private cruelty and the world war both have their start in the heated brain."],"Elizabeth Cady Stanton":["The history of the past is but one long struggle upward to equality.","The best protection any woman can have... is courage.","The moment we begin to fear the opinions of others and hesitate to tell the truth that is in us, and from motives of policy are silent when we should speak, the divine floods of light and life no longer flow into our souls.","We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men and women are created equal.","We are the only class in history that has been left to fight its battles alone, unaided by the ruling powers. White labor and the freed black men had their champions, but where are ours?","The prolonged slavery of women is the darkest page in human history.","Come, come, my conservative friend, wipe the dew off your spectacles, and see that the world is moving.","The memory of my own suffering has prevented me from ever shadowing one young soul with the superstition of the Christian religion.","The woman is uniformly sacrificed to the wife and mother.","It is impossible for one class to appreciate the wrongs of another.","I thought that the chief thing to be done in order to equal boys was to be learned and courageous. So I decided to study Greek and learn to manage a horse.","The whole tone of Church teaching in regard to women is, to the last degree, contemptuous and degrading.","The more complete the despotism, the more smoothly all things move on the surface.","The greatest block today in the way of woman's emancipation is the church, the canon law, the Bible and the priesthood.","Women of all classes are awakening to the necessity of self-support, but few are willing to do the ordinary useful work for which they are fitted.","To make laws that man cannot, and will not obey, serves to bring all law into contempt.","Self-development is a higher duty than self-sacrifice.","Human beings lose their logic in their vindictiveness.","Nothing strengthens the judgment and quickens the conscience like individual responsibility.","I am always busy, which is perhaps the chief reason why I am always well.","The Bible and the Church have been the greatest stumbling blocks in the way of women's emancipation.","The heyday of woman's life is the shady side of fifty.","I shall not grow conservative with age.","To live for a principle, for the triumph of some reform by which all mankind are to be lifted up to be wedded to an idea may be, after all, the holiest and happiest of marriages.","Words cannot describe the indignation a proud woman feels for her sex in disfranchisement.","To throw obstacles in the way of a complete education is like putting out the eyes.","Surely the immutable laws of the universe can teach more impressive and exalted lessons than the holy books of all the religions on earth.","We found nothing grand in the history of the Jews nor in the morals inculcated in the Pentateuch. I know of no other books that so fully teach the subjection and degradation of woman.","The religious superstitions of women perpetuate their bondage more than all other adverse influences.","Woman's discontent increases in exact proportion to her development."],"Elizabeth Caty Stanton":["The strongest reason for giving woman all the opportunities for higher education, for the full development of her faculties, her forces of mind and body... is the solitude and personal responsibility of her own individual life.","The God of justice is with us, and our word, our work - our prayer for freedom will not, cannot be in vain.","There would be more sense in insisting on man's limitations because he cannot be a mother than on a woman's because she can be.","The more I think on the present condition of woman, the more am I oppressed with the reality of their degradation.","The right is ours. Have it we must. Use it we will.","To have drunkards, idiots, horse-racing, rumselling rowdies, ignorant foreigners, and silly boys fully recognized, while we ourselves are thrust out from all the rights that belong to citizens, it is too grossly insulting to... be longer quietly submitted to."],"Elizabeth Chambers":["I've always loved baking - it's a huge part of who I am and what I do.","If you have an opportunity to help others or incite change, it feels like a moral obligation to do so.","I absolutely value autonomy. I value freedom and having the ability to implement change right away.","If not managed properly, owning a company and running a business with multiple locations can make you feel constantly overwhelmed.","We don't have a no-dessert rule, but we do have a no-bad-ingredient rule. Everything from scratch.","Shifting gears from my journalistic work to bakery life allows me to step away and see things from a different perspective. Some of my most creative ideas or biggest aha moments have come when I was immersed in one job while thinking about the other from a slightly removed point of view.","We love food in our house.","It's important to give back because that's what we were put on this planet to do.","A lot of bakeries, especially cupcake stores, look like you just walked into a Katy Perry video.","My dad is amazing: he taught me everything I know about sales. He volunteered to be the Girl Scout cookie mom and gave everybody sales quotas, and basically, every girl went home crying because he was super intense.","At the Human Rights Foundation, I love being able to drive an interview and value-connecting with someone I'm interviewing so that they feel comfortable enough to open up and share their story with me.","Whether I'm pursuing a story or conducting an interview or I'm at the bakery implementing policy and procedure, I have a team who is looking to me. I think my persona is the same for both jobs - perhaps a little bit more in command with the bakery. I say that only because we have so many more employees, and ultimately I make every single decision.","I personally didn't subscribe to drastically changing our lives as a result of having children. Our children are our world, but I truly believe that it's healthier to invite children into your life instead of making everything about them.","When I've been working especially long hours, I make a point to spend an extra hour or two without my phone, doing something my children choose. They love the park or pool time, but mostly, they love my undivided attention.","I firmly believe that in order to take the best care of our children, we need to be sure that we take care of ourselves. I make it a priority to plan date night once a week, make time for a massage or, at the very least, a bubble bath when I can."],"Elizabeth Coleman":["You have a mind. And you have other people. Start with those, and change the world.","History provides a laboratory in which we see played out the actual, as well as the intended, consequences of ideas.","The problem is there is no such thing as a viable democracy made up of experts, zealots, politicians and spectators.","The values and voices of democracy are silent. Either we have lost touch with those values or, no better, believe they need not or cannot be taught."],"Elizabeth Daily":["I am single and happy.","I don't I have everything I want; however, I have a lot and for that I am very grateful.","I love having my hair blown dry by a stylist and I also truly enjoy being with my friends and family.","I love going to the movies and being moved emotionally. I like my work, singing and writing in my journal."],"Elizabeth David":["Everyday holds the possibility of a miracle.","Writing doesn't come easily to me. It gets more and more difficult.","I'm very interested in my new kitchen equipment shop. I've started it with two friends.","I don't copy recipes without trying them out. I don't reprint without trying them again.","An awful lot of people think it's easy to lift recipes out."],"Elizabeth Debicki":["A good night in is a series of documentaries.","One of my favourite things to think about is, if you could be invisible and go back in time, where would you go? I've always said ancient Egypt. I would love to see them building the pyramids, and I've always had a real fascination with medieval time and monarchy in medieval times.","Every time I see a good play or watch a good movie, I have the same feeling I had as a child of wanting to be that person on stage or wanting to run through the forest with a big dress on.","Kissing in films, it's just another thing you have to do. It kind of becomes as technical as how to open a door, really.","I don't have a story about an epiphany in which I suddenly realised I wanted to be an actor. It was much more a case of the idea dawning on me gradually.","As a child, I got bored with my surroundings, so I would be another person for a little while.","I'm not a great sleeper. I try and do too many things every day. I think that I get very obsessive about parts and projects. I do let them kind of consume me, and when there's something on the horizon that I want to be involved in, I just kind of hurtle myself towards it.","That world of spies and espionage, there's a coldness to it. That's what makes those worlds fascinating - and what makes le Carre's work so interesting.","I guess the bigger you dream, the further you have to fall if you don't get it, so it can be a bit of a scary thing to be that ambitious.","I was a dancer from a young age. My parents were dancers; we were taken to a lot of ballet as children. It occurred to me that what I liked more than dancing the steps was acting the story of whatever particular performance I was taking part in.","I was very new to working in front of the camera when I started shooting 'Gatsby', so I set myself the mission of gleaning as much information as possible out of the much more experienced actors. The cast was astoundingly talented.","Red carpets are awful. They're like a kind of purgatory - you stand there, and there are cameras flashing everywhere. One of my first red carpets was in Cannes for 'The Great Gatsby,' and I'd never seen anything like it.","People ask me what it's like to be tall, and I don't know what to say because I don't know any different. I grew up in a very tall house, so I wasn't an anomaly there.","My parents were ballet dancers, and I did a lot of ballet, too, so I think I learned quite early on how to hold my body. Although I do recall desperately wishing I was shorter at school.","I loved Catherine Deneuve, Sophia Loren, and Ursula Andress. They had an incredible strength but fragility at the same time, especially Catherine Deneuve, who had an aloofness that impressed me.","I have to say that filming 'The Night Manager' was not just amazing but also very daunting at first. I used to describe myself as the token plebeian surrounded by all your national treasures. All that glittering talent in one place; I knew Hugh from Fry and Laurie videos that my grandpa used to watch, and Tom Hollander's 'Rev' is hilarious.","I feed off variety. I don't want to repeat myself if I can help it, but once they've seen you doing one thing, directors often just want you to do it again.","Often, female characters are quite one dimensional, especially in a two hour film; television gives characters room to breathe and develop.","I think there's something beautifully old fashioned about waiting all week then sitting down and watching something on television together. I'm generation box set, accustomed to binging on multiple episodes at a time, which is fun but quite a solitary pursuit because you do it alone.","There is something about a theatre room that is really like a laboratory for trying things and failing, because you have time to do that, and you can explore something deeply and discard it if it's not working.","I am very tall, and when you're a teenager, you want to be like everyone else. I used to slump a lot; it's very human at that stage to want to be part of the crowd and not want any part of you that is sticking out.","Sometimes I have a nervous breakdown over my suitcase - over socks - because your brain just goes, 'I just can't pack again. I can't.' You're looking at your suitcase going, 'I'm in five countries in two weeks, and it's four different seasons.' That's when my brain melts.","I think I've developed a sort of ADD for geography now. When I've been in a country for too long, I'm like, 'I think it's time to leave.' I don't know what that's going to do to me in later life.","Acting is a craft to me: I just think you get better the more you do it. And then the irony to that is your doing it is not in your control. If it was up to most actors, we'd work all the time, and we'd always get better. But it's not in our control, so we have to wait to be given parts to do.","It even sounds stupid to hear myself say the first costume designer I worked with was Catherine Martin, and she won an Oscar for it, but that was just my very lucky draw of roll of the dice.","I think that if you're lucky enough to work with a stylist who pulls a rack from the beginning that you love everything on it, that's a blessing.","You think there's a rule book, in a way, until you realize there's absolutely no rule book, and you can use a red carpet to express something about yourself. There are so many wonderful designers in the world, and they create such wonderful things. Why go with something uninteresting?","It often happens that you leave your house in the dark, shoot on a sound stage without natural lighting, and then go home in the dark. A whole week can go past, and it can feel like 12 hours.","I definitely try my best not to stay in character when I'm not on set, which can be more difficult in some roles than others.","Often, you're not quite sure what people have seen you in, but the script lands in your inbox. That was the case with 'The Night Manager.'","I grew up learning ballet, and then I took up contemporary as I got older. I probably thought I was going to be a ballet dancer when I was younger, but at a certain age, I really was more interested in acting.","A dancer's life is as peripatetic and unstable as that of an actor's. You're freelancing yourself all the time, and a dancer's lifespan is even shorter than an actor's: once they turn 30 or 35, they have to stop.","Granted, it's not easy to be a super-tall woman in Hollywood. But there are times when it works in my favour. In 'The Night Manager,' for example, both of my co-stars, Hugh Laurie and Tom Hiddleston, are also well over 6 ft. and it was lovely to look a co-star in the eye and not have them standing on an apple box!","When I went to the Victorian College of the Arts in Melbourne to study drama, I felt I'd finally found my place in life.","I did flirt with the idea of going to law school, but not for long. Maybe I'll play a lawyer one day - the beauty of acting is that you can try on so many different roles without having to commit to them in real life.","On a film set, everything's done for you. You get to a stage where you can't even remember the last time you made yourself a sandwich. The crazy thing is that, as actors, we're trying to portray the human condition, but we're often not living in reality.","Majorca is this destination where, you know, you have a lot of money, but you want to go somewhere quite exclusive. And the culture of the island is still traditionally Spanish. It hasn't been infested by tourists. I think, in the '20s or something, an extremely wealthy person built this little kingdom of villas.","It's tricky territory, height and co-stars. The only thing I can say is that it's never been an issue in my life.","Dancing gives an innate physical awareness - it's physical training. Acting feels like the same medium but just with words.","Charlestoning is hard. People were fit in the '20s to be able to do that. I guess they didn't sit in front of their computers all day.","I've always been a big Cate Blanchett fan. Such a wonderful role model, the way she carries herself through her profession. She has so much grace to her, and so much intelligence. I've also always been a big Katharine Hepburn fan.","I didn't really know what to expect. I had been told about the scale of Cannes, but nothing could have prepared me for just how many people would turn out for our photo calls or for the opening ceremony.","I have always been a fan of Alex Perry's work. His gowns are so beautiful, elegant, and always uniquely crafted to the woman wearing them on the red carpet. They are a true piece of art-meets-couture.","On a red carpet, you really want to feel your best, so to work with a designer who will shape a dress to your figure and take into consideration your opinions is really a blessing.","I have a sense of Europe also being like home. I mean, Australia is my home, and my heart is there, but I suppose I've always felt close to Europe, given we had family there, and we would visit.","It was quite a thespian - 'thespy' - sort of household. My mum had a dance school, and my dad now works in a theatre, so I spent a lot of time going to see dance as a young child - it was just a part of who we were.","I don't think it's healthy to buy into hype in any form, whether it's positive or negative. You have to exist in yourself and just move on with life.","I'm a gypsy at heart. I have a little triangle where I tend to go, which is between Sydney, Los Angeles, and London, and I'm happy with that at the moment.","Baz Luhrmann is a very visual director. He needs to see things as they would unfold in his world.","Television is the medium that's allowing women's stories to flourish."],"Elizabeth Dole":["We believe in the dignity of every life, the possibility of every mind, the divinity of every soul. This is our true North.","The very idea of freedom incites fear in the hearts of terrorists across the world.","There is no doubt that now, more than ever, we must work to end our dependence on foreign oil sources. But we cannot do so by ignoring the wishes of the coastal communities that oppose drilling.","My commitment is to strive to lean on the Lord with my whole heart, reading His word daily and earnestly seeking His will in my life.","Iraq is the central battleground in the war on terror. The terrorists certainly know what is at stake, which is why they are pulling out all the stops to derail our efforts there. They know that a free and democratic Iraq is a serious blow to their interests.","The United States is the leader of the free world.","The terrorists know what is at stake, which is why they are pulling out all the stops to derail our efforts. They understand that a free and democratic Iraq is a serious blow to their interests.","Despite recent media reports that have clouded, or even misrepresented, the facts, there is compelling evidence that al-Qaida and Iraq have been linked for more than a decade.","In liberating Iraq, we have rid the nation and the rest of the world from the danger of Saddam Hussein.","I am a firm believer in free but fair trade. However the United States should not be on the losing end of trade agreements that are not enforced. It is time that we make China play fairly.","Let me be clear, Mr. President, mistakes have been made in Iraq. And this operation has been far from perfect as evidenced by the fact that Zarqawi and other terrorists continue to wreak havoc throughout Iraq."],"Elizabeth Drew":["The test of literature is, I suppose, whether we ourselves live more intensely for the reading of it.","The world is not run by thought, nor by imagination, but by opinion.","Travel, instead of broadening the mind, often merely lengthens the conversation.","Democracy, like any non-coercive relationship, rests on a shared understanding of limits.","Too often travel, instead of broadening the mind, merely lengthens the conversation."],"Elizabeth Edwards":["Resilience is accepting your new reality, even if it's less good than the one you had before.","You recognize a survivor when you see one. You recognize a fighter when you see one.","But I have found that in the simple act of living with hope, and in the daily effort to have a positive impact in the world, the days I do have are made all the more meaningful and precious. And for that I am grateful.","A positive attitude is not going to save you. What it's going to do is, everyday, between now and the day you die, whether that's a short time from now or a long time from now, that every day, you're going to actually live.","You all know that I have been sustained throughout my life by three saving graces - my family, my friends, and a faith in the power of resilience and hope. These graces have carried me through difficult times and they have brought more joy to the good times than I ever could have imagined.","I grew up in a Navy family.","I could be wrong, but I think heterosexual marriage is threatened more by heterosexuals. I don't know why gay marriage challenges my marriage in any way.","The days of our lives, for all of us, are numbered. We know that. And yes, there are certainly times when we aren't able to muster as much strength and patience as we would like. It's called being human.","I love children, love spending time with them; I love getting things for them.","I think self-knowledge is the rarest trait in a human being.","Part of resilience is deciding to make yourself miserable over something that matters, or deciding to make yourself miserable over something that doesn't matter.","I think being an effective First Lady is first of all being the partner that your husband needs.","I want to reclaim who I am.","Everybody has their burdens, their grief that they carry with them.","A lot of people have great hope, and a lot of people who have great hope live. And, some of them who have great hope die. So it's not that hope is going to save you.","It takes a lot of work to put together a marriage, to put together a family and a home.","You have to have enough respect for other human beings to leave their lives alone.

The practice of law has changed. Every agreement is a fight.","I think that we're foolhardy to not be engaging in federal funding of stem-cell research in the most aggressive way we possibly can.","If people think that you're throwing babies out, dissecting children, to do stem-cell research, I'm not for that.","I can't turn on the television without seeing me, or open the newspaper without seeing me and, honestly, I'm sick to death of me.","I think that it is our intention to deny cancer any control over us.","I've often said that the most important thing you can give your children is wings. Because, you're not gonna always be able to bring food to the nest. You're... sometimes... they're gonna have to be able to fly by themselves.","I took my son's name.

I'm not. God will enlighten me when the time comes. And if I've done the right thing, I will be enlightened. And if I believe, I'll be saved.

We had enough, but not a lot.","Whenever anyone pulls out of the race, you know, unless they've just been trounced in the days before, there's also - always a lot of questions about why that happened.","I'm a puzzle doer.","You know, I once read a short story about how much you could tell about people from their shoes. You could tell where they had been, what they did, whether they were real walkers.","You never know when something's going to hit you in a particular way and just knock you loose.","I do think voters do take into consideration - particularly early state voters - take into consideration a wide range of factors, including electability, and they know that part of electability is the total package that you're presenting.","Every parent has gone through a period when their child wasn't so happy with them.","Almost everybody embraces life.","I'm actually one of those people who get up energetic in the morning.","I have less energy than I did when I was a younger parent, although I was never really a young parent.","Sometimes you get politicians who dig their feet into the sand and aren't willing to listen to another voice.","You know, everybody knows some of what politicians say is malarkey, and having somebody there to call them on it is good.

It's usually advised by consultants who don't want to see you march to the end of a limb.","To be perfectly frank, there is an odd place after losing a child, where you think somehow your life is worth less.","In a sense, having cancer takes you by the shoulders and shakes you.","It's just a part of our nature to hope.","You wouldn't know I was sick unless you knew I was sick.","The worst thing to me would be that you put on the face you think people want to see, and then they don't like it and you think, Would they have liked the real me?","Honestly, I get energized by the crowds. They feed me emotionally.","By what you do, you teach your children how to respond to difficult information.","I have three living children for whom this is a father who I want them to love and on whom they're going to have to rely if my disease takes a bad turn.","I've spent a lot of words on my own mortality.","Life is this great big blackboard, and on it you write all the things that you do.","Growing up in an Italian family, you use a harsh tone and 10 minutes later everybody forgets about it.","My father had gone to Vietnam.","People find it a great blessing if their child left behind a child.","My heart goes out to the grieving parents who lost their two-year-old or their newborn.","I loved campaigning.","A lot of sad stories in a row - that wears on you.","I'm part of a community that holds each other up, and it's been great to be held up too.","My job is to stay alive until the medicine and research catch up.","I love my books.","Part of what I want to do is sort of reclaim my story - it belongs to me and to my children, who have to live with whoever their mother is.","I'm not a victim - I never want to be perceived that way.","Having bought furniture for my own house, and bought furniture for our house in Washington, a furniture store seemed like a good idea, and it also played into my personal history.","You know, there are no guarantees on prognosis."],"Elizabeth Emken":["My son is a blessing in every way.","The genetics of autism are real, but there are also environmental triggers.","I offer something very different from the lifelong career politicians who have worked their way up to run for higher office or those who can parachute in with checks for $5 million or $10 million, and that seems to be the definition of credible or legitimate.

Feinstein is out of touch, but just to make it worse, by not embracing today's technology, she isn't even connected. Out of touch and disconnected.","The federal government secures the border; Californians decide how we want to treat our population. I think we need a vibrant guest worker program. If we have one, we're going to stop having a lot of issues at the border.","I believe both parties are sending the wrong kind of people to Washington, D.C.","When you look at a Congress that has an 84 percent disapproval rating, that means that for the most part, the people of this country, and certainly California, are looking for new leadership.","Part of the problem you have is that you don't have a dialogue between elected officials and their constituents. They've built these barricades, these barriers around themselves and tried to avoid interaction with their constituents.","Ironically, if you look at Dianne Feinstein's profile and you look at my profile, I'm the 99 percent. Dianne Feinstein's the one percent. She appeals to one percent.","We need new energy back in Washington.","I take on daunting tasks."],"Elizabeth Esty":["As we celebrate Labor Day, we honor the men and women who fought tirelessly for workers' rights, which are so critical to our strong and successful labor force.","Unfortunately, this will have a ripple effect in the economy. People carrying heavy student-loan debt won't buy houses, start families, or start businesses. This will hurt the future economy.","Veterans Day is an acknowledgment that those willing to make the ultimate sacrifice for our country - and their families - deserve our admiration and respect today and every day.","Devices that allow people to shoot up to 100 rounds of ammunition at one time have no place in our schools, no place in our parks, no place on our streets, no place in our communities, and no place in this country.","For me to do my job effectively, we need to continue to earn public confidence. That involves transparency and accountability.","Civil rights and women's rights and gay rights all take time in this country.","We owe it to our service men and women and their families, who sacrificed so much for our country, to find out the answers they deserve and make care and treatment for them, their children, and their grandchildren a priority.","The water crisis in Flint, Michigan, has shown us what can happen when we ignore the warning signs of lead poisoning and corroding pipes.","We can and must do our part to increase the number of Syrian refugees being resettled in the U.S.","The STEM fields play an increasingly important role in the U.S. economy, but women are still underrepresented in most STEM sectors.","We should not be waiting until trains derail, bridges collapse and people die to adequately fund our transportation infrastructure.","Elections are about choices, and part of what you do is draw that contrast.","Gun violence is a plague in all of our communities, and we must come together to stop it.","If you don't like public service, don't run for office.","We are a great enough country to respect the Second Amendment rights of lawful gun owners and protect our children. And those things don't need to be in conflict.","We need more access to quality health care, not less.","Since the tragedy at Sandy Hook Elementary School three years ago, we have lost over 90,000 Americans to gun violence. This is a manmade crisis that needs to be treated as the public health epidemic it has become.","I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to advance policies that level the playing field for American workers and incentivize investing in jobs here at home.","The lower Farmington River and Salmon Brook are unparalleled natural treasures with some of the highest water quality in Connecticut.","We know that school readiness programs work, and the best ones work extraordinarily well. They are effective in reducing the achievement gap, which in Connecticut is among the highest in the country.","We have an epidemic of gun violence in America, and in trying to understand how that has happened, part of what we need to do is help equip our children to respond not with fear but with kindness. This has to be the way we go forward.","I hear over and over again from local leaders and business owners that one of the best ways we can revitalize our cities and towns is to support brownfields cleanup efforts.","We need to develop clean, affordable, and reliable energy sources, and frankly, we need to license that technology to the rest of the world.","If elected members of any body - whether it's a state house or Congress - were not willing to take career-ending or at least election-losing votes, I would not have the right to vote today.","There are things that matter more than your election. That may take difficult votes, may take career-ending votes for people, but if we aren't willing to do that, then we're not going to move forward.","I liked New England.","I just thought Harvard sounded great. So let's see if I get in.

That probably hinders sometimes and helps sometimes. To some people, that makes me more approachable.","Most of what I've proposed in Congress grew out of issues raised with me back here in Connecticut.","Hillary Clinton has spent those decades before her time in public office and since her time in public office advocating for common sense measures to fight gun violence.","Workers' rights are under attack across the country.","Those who know me would say I'm a passionate and hard-working mom and a community leader who knows how to get things done.","You have to believe in something strongly enough that you would lose your seat over it.","There's been an enormous awakening, and I think recognition that the mass shootings we saw in Sandy Hook and other places are very related to the shootings we see every day in our cities.","Lead levels exceeding federal thresholds pose a serious public health threat, particularly for more vulnerable populations.","We need to stop trying to restrict access to lifesaving cancer screenings, birth control, and well-woman exams.","We need to stop refighting 40-year old battles on women's rights.","There is no possible justification or excuse for marketing dangerous weapons to children as if they were toys.","Clearly, we are courting tragedy by turning a blind eye to marketing gimmicks plainly intended to turn children into gun enthusiasts before they are even old enough to buy a firearm of their own.","Every week, we read about horrific tragedies resulting from children who play with firearms and accidentally shoot themselves or their family members.","E-cigarette companies are using shameful tactics, such as Joe Camel-like cartoons in advertisements and creating e-cigarette flavors like bubblegum and cotton candy, to addict our children early - and guarantee another generation of smokers.","There's no reason to continue including language in the federal spending bill to prohibit the CDC and NIH from studying the causes or effects of gun violence on public health.","We should not silence our nation's researchers.","The Healthy Homes Tax Credit Act will help ensure that all families, regardless of their income, can protect their children from the lifelong health impacts of lead poisoning.","We need to close the tax loopholes that have awarded companies moving out of the country and overseas; we need a government that will keep our country safe from terrorists at home and abroad... and a government that is responsive to the needs of the people.","In my lifetime, I have seen how greater liberty, greater justice, and greater respect ultimately does prevail, but it prevails only when people are willing to fight for it and willing to lose for it.","It would be really easy to get discouraged over gun safety, and I have to explain all the time why I am not giving up and why people should not give up.","I would like to live long enough to see the day when people talk about which guns are the safest.","In Connecticut, we have a vibrant history of advocating to ensure our workers are treated fairly and given the rights and protections they deserve. Still, we need to do more to protect all American workers.","There's more GPS in the phone in your pocket than on most of our 21st century airliners - that's frightening.","We know that, relative to GPS, radar is not as accurate - we'd be seeing our planes' precise positions in 3-D, not just approximate locations every eight seconds.","We need a comprehensive strategy that includes expanding criminal background checks for all commercial gun sales, dedicated federal law to combat gun trafficking, and a strong commitment to mental health services.","We shield our children from hazardous products - liquid nicotine should be no exception.","Manufacturing is the backbone of Connecticut's economy, and suppliers such as Click Bond depend on partnerships with U.S.-based manufacturers that export many of their products with Ex-Im's backing.","Everyone is able to give to someone.","My brother had the courage to come out in 1978, when equality was still a distant dream.","We still have work to do in our efforts to advance equal rights for all Americans.","We need to ensure that no one is denied employment, housing, opportunities, or benefits because of their sexual orientation.","The TECH Careers Act will open the door for more Americans to have successful middle-class careers and help small businesses in Connecticut and across the country access a qualified pool of talented workers.","We have a lot of work we need to do to make sure all of our children have a better understanding of this diverse and wonderful and beautiful world.","We want to take the energy surrounding the Sandy Hook anniversary that might otherwise be consumed by grief or anger - or this week in San Bernardino by fear - and channel some of that to honor our common humanity and love each other.","We have the opportunity and the responsibility to lead our country to a better and brighter future, and I cannot wait to roll up my sleeves and get back to work.","I do think the U.S. has a moral and political leadership role to play.","I'm baffled that Mark Greenberg would send an offensive email politicizing the beheading of an American journalist.","Cities and towns throughout central and northwest Connecticut have strong industrial histories and are now in the process of transitioning into new sources of economic growth. I'm doing what I can to be a strong partner in these efforts.","Brownfields cleanups have been treated like capital investments in the tax laws, and they really are repairs and should be taxed as such.","Government ought to make it easy for people to do the right thing.","We need to not reduce but increase our commitment to research.","We've become so accustomed to teaching to the tests that we've forgotten about a child's joy of discovery.","We have to look at loan forgiveness to incentivise young people to pursue degrees in areas where we know we need help.","This historically has been an issue that both parties have run away from. For the first time, Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party in its platform are making this issue, about needing to do better as a country to take common sense steps to help prevent gun violence.","I think we need to raise our voices, and we need to demonstrate to the people we represent, as well as the American people, that their leaders have a responsibility to take action.","While we may not know how to stop these horrific mass shootings, we do know this: Limiting high-capacity magazines will save lives, and we know this because it has saved lives.","We've been having a lot of hearings lately about the reliability of the grid and the need for more distributive generation. We can be a leader of that here in Connecticut.","We may not have the cheapest labor costs, but where we can compete is innovation. Historically, that's been Connecticut's strength, and it can be again.","It should scare every voter in the 5th District that a powerful D.C. lobbyist is trying to install a personal congressman in our part of Connecticut.","My job is to be a problem-solver.","I was a co-sponsor of Comprehensive Immigration Reform.","When I was elected to Congress, this was the No. 1 issue businesses brought up. They said that if we want this country to succeed, we need immigration reform.","From fully funding nutrition programs to protecting children from liquid nicotine poisoning, I have focused many of my efforts in Congress on advocating for polices that invest in our most valuable resource - our children.","I am proud to be named a Defender of Children by First Focus, and I will continue to call on Congress to enact comprehensive policies that improve the well-being of our children.","Today, I heard directly from Connecticut workers about the importance of strong, predictable federal research funding and how the federal government can be a better partner in spurring innovation and helping life-saving medication reach families who need it most.","We just have to do better as a country on incorporating the best technology to allow us to get where we want to get quickly and safely.","We need faith leaders like Eman Beshtawii."],"Elizabeth Fishel":["A sister is both your mirror - and your opposite.","Comparison is a death knell to sibling harmony.","Both within the family and without, our sisters hold up our mirrors: our images of who we are and of who we can dare to be."],"Elizabeth Flock":["One of the most bitter complaints of craft brewers is that big beer wins consumers by introducing beers whose names resemble the names of actual independent beers.

Orwell's famous 1946 essay, 'Politics and the English Language,' centers on the use of abstract words, often by politicians, to obscure reality.","Rock music has always embraced - and even represented - rebellion, rowdiness, and a robust disdain for social decorum. But along with more classical art forms like theater, opera, and the symphony, it's suffering from the distracted, smartphone-carrying audiences of the digital age.","Artists know they need to have digital presences to build and bolster their fan base, and fans have exploited that fact.","Xenophobia is defined as the uncontrollable fear of foreigners. That fear should not dictate the immigration dialogue any longer.","Wal-Mart's slogan 'Save money, live better' promises a lot. So does its entrance into Chicago.","The Food Stamp Challenge, which challenges higher-income families to live as if they are on food stamps, estimates that a person on food stamps has a budget of about $1.25 per meal. In other words, a family on food stamps must buy an entire meal per person for less than the cost of an average cup of coffee.","At first glance, The Color Run does look a lot like Holi. Its website is populated by photos of people throwing coloured powder at each other and in the air, outdoors, at the start of spring. The only difference, it seemed, was that there was a 5 km. run added in. And that it cost $54.99 to participate.","The groups who spend the most on lobbying lawmakers in Washington are well-known: ExxonMobil, Boeing, AT&T, General Electric.","The American Humanist Association, whose slogan is 'Good without a God,' created the National Day of Reason with the Washington Area Secular Humanists to raise awareness about government threats to religious liberty and up the profile of the non-religious community.","In the 1980s and the 1990s, when HIV hit its peak, the gay community was at the forefront of the fight against the silent killer.","Over its 40 years, Muppets on 'Sesame Street' have addressed AIDS, divorce, a parent's deployment overseas, and a death in the family. But the show is addressing incarceration in a way it didn't used to: by bringing the show directly to the kids and families it wants to reach.","There is a perception that the media is very liberal, very biased, produces fake news.","There's perhaps no better way to understand what's happening in a marriage than being inside the home.","So often, as a reporter, we have to parachute into places. We don't have much time. We have to make sense of the story as fast as we can.","Every Valentine's Day, I pretend I don't care. Like many of us, I say I don't want the flowers or chocolates or a homemade card. How cheesy. I pretend that it's over-the-top to want the person you like to make you a ridiculously nice dinner, or do some showy gesture, ala John Cusack with the boombox in 'Say Anything.'","Showy displays of love don't come naturally to everyone. They don't come naturally to me. They also come with a risk: a risk of rejection, being made to feel silly, or making yourself into a spectacle.","India has a long history with devotional, even obsessive love, be it for a personal god or for your lover.","2017 saw a slew of big pop and hip-hop records, a number of breakout female singer-songwriters and all-girl bands, and the return of beloved '60s soul artist Don Bryant and pop star Kesha.","There was a time when poetry often made its way to vinyl; take a deep dive, for example, into the beat poets' countercultural albums of the 1950s to '80s.","When American poet Alice Notley was very young, she used to sit in front of the radio and just listen. When she got older, she began to hear words and songs in her head everywhere she went - songs she loved, like 'Begin the Beguine' by Cole Porter, and her own words that sometimes tumbled out into poems.","The Museum of the Bible, the sprawling, 430,000-square-foot tribute to the good book, has been dogged by controversies long before opening day. It's been criticized for not including enough Jesus, for excluding various religious traditions, and for being evangelical propaganda.","Antoine 'Fats' Domino was a 1950s rock n' roll pioneer, a larger-than-life New Orleans figure, and a role model for the African-American community in a time of deep segregation.","Just a decade after 'Living in Bondage,' Nollywood films, made in some 300 languages, were being watched in both urban and rural areas, distributed on both the streets and online, and finding their way into international festivals.","Americans don't know the Constitution.

It's a town where guns are sold at yard sales, where Pentecostal churches are nearly as common as restaurants, and where distrust of Hillary Clinton is visceral and deep-seated.","Hindu nationalist outfits like the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh perpetuate a false notion of the 'love jihad' - the false idea that young Muslim men are making Hindu girls fall in love with them to trick them into converting to Islam.","What compels the Hindu right's volcanic reaction to Valentine's Day? Some of its members have protested that the holiday is the product of a 'rotten imported culture' from the West.","Disco told audiences to dance, while punk told them to be anything but passive. The artists didn't mind; in fact, they encouraged it.","When Neil Young caught two women incessantly texting at a concert in 2012, he began mock typing on an invisible phone on stage until the women noticed and apparently left the show.","I think there is this cliche of Indian men who want a forward-thinking girlfriend but a traditional wife.

Orwell was fixated on the idea that under certain governments, the past can be altered or documents rewritten.","I took a job as a reporter in India, where I lived with several married couples, which got me interested in why some marriages work and others fail. Back home, many women of my generation were also putting off marriage or not getting married at all, which only led me to more questions.","For most of my life, I, like many Americans, had greeted the idea of an arranged marriage with a mixture of fascination and skepticism.","There is no denying that unhappiness - even violence - exists in some arranged marriages. Or that some arranged marriages are borne out of cruelty. And part of that six percent global divorce rate can be attributed to the powerful stigma against divorce that's present in countries where arranged marriage is common.","In any marriage, it seems, love is when you keep paying attention.","Certainly, Occupy Wall Street protesters have different ideas about the movement's mission. Many of the marchers I met even disagreed on the purpose of their trek - some thought it was about getting to Washington to protest the 'supercommittee'; others thought it was about visiting other Occupations.","I am not Indian, but I have lived and worked in Mumbai, visited on multiple reporting trips, and celebrated more than one Holi there.","Founded by a Mormon couple in Utah in 2012, The Color Run has proved to be a brilliant idea.","County jails used to be just stopovers for inmates headed to state prisons. But as Arkansas' state facilities have reached capacity, jails are increasingly being used to hold prisoners long term.","The lack of space and a growing prison population has strained resources and put pressure on all levels of the penal system.","The costs of running a prison system as large as Arkansas' are significant, and the system's failures can make things worse.","President Obama has shelled out more in federal spending than the five presidents that came before him.","In 1984, Jim Koch used his family's lager recipe to start Boston Beer Company, which has since become the largest 'craft' brewer in the country. He brews Samuel Adams, a rich lager named after the American revolutionary that comes with the tagline, 'Take pride in your beer.'","The battle between craft breweries and big beer stretches back to the 1990s, when the idea of buying a beer brewed by a small, independent brewery first took off.","The Brewers Association, a trade group of some 2000 small and independent brewers, was founded in 2005 to be a 'passionate voice for craft brewers' and craft beer, and it has made itself as vocal as the bigger Beer Institute.","Not every dollar spent to gain influence on Capitol Hill comes from a big global industrial behemoth.

And writing is both an art and a craft.","I attempt to write a good novel. Whether it is literature or not is something that will be decided by the ages, not by me and not by a pack of critics around the globe.","Lots of people want to have written; they don't want to write. In other words, they want to see their name on the front cover of a book and their grinning picture on the back. But this is what comes at the end of a job, not at the beginning.","I don't think anyone could write about another culture and get it 100 percent accurate.","It is the job of the novelist to touch the reader.","I find it both fascinating and disconcerting when I discover yet another person who believes that writing can't be taught. Frankly, I don't understand this point of view.","Writing is no dying art form in America because most published writers here accept the wisdom and the necessity of encouraging the talent that follows in their footsteps.","Essentially and most simply put, plot is what the characters do to deal with the situation they are in. It is a logical sequence of events that grow from an initial incident that alters the status quo of the characters.","Oh, yes, I taught 13 and a half years. I taught English, first at a Catholic school and then at El Toro High School in Lake Forest, Calif.","The Pacific Northwest, and particularly Whidbey Island, is extremely suited to be a location in a novel.","Plotting is difficult for me, and always has been. I do that before I actually start writing, but I always do characters, and the arc of the story, first... You can't do anything without a story arc. Where is it going to begin, where will it end.","I knew from the age of seven that I was meant to be a writer.","I wish that I had known back then that a mastery of process would lead to a product. Then I probably wouldn't have found it so frightening to write.","I have to know the killer, the victim and the motive when I begin. Then I start to create the characters and see how the novel takes shape based on what these people are like.","Creating the characters is the most creative part of the novel except for the language itself. There I am, sitting in front of my computer in right-brain mode, typing the things that come to mind - which become the seeds of plot. It's scary, though, because I always wonder: Is it going to be there this time?","While I've written in the POV (point of view) of adolescent characters before... I never have had to create novels in which those characters not only drive the plot, but also are instrumental in resolving whatever issue the plot deals with.","I myself have suffered periodically from hearing voices at night when I'm trying to sleep.","I'm interested in the dark side of man. I'm interested in taboos, and murder is the greatest taboo. Characters are fascinating in their extremity, not in their happiness.","I try to create a challenge for myself in each book. And sometimes, believe me, I just kick myself afterwards, and say, 'Why on earth did you ever attempt this, you idiot!' But I'm always better for the experience.","When I start a book, I write a minimum of five pages every day, except weekends. If I'm going on a ski trip, I take my computer with me, get up at six, do my five pages, and then go skiing.","I write the kinds of novels I like to read, where the setting is rendered with love and care.","I really liked the idea of creating a journal myself. It's like the way I clear my throat. I write a page every day, maybe 500 words. It could be about something I'm specifically worried about in the new novel; it could be a question I want answered; it could be something that's going on in my personal life. I just use it as an exercise.","Having a facility for language is an important part of being an author.","What we are is what we were always meant to be, and that's writers.","I taught English, first at a Catholic school and then at El Toro High School in Lake Forest, Calif."],"Elizabeth Gilbert":["I think it's wonderful when a love story begins with a great deal of romance and affection, passion and excitement, that's how it should be. But I don't necessarily know that it's the wisest thing in the world to expect that it ends there, or that it should, 30 years down the road, still look as it did on the night of your first kiss.","Oh, I just want what we all want: a comfortable couch, a nice beverage, a weekend of no distractions and a book that will stop time, lift me out of my quotidian existence and alter my thinking forever.","I love my friends and family, but I also love it when they can't find me and I can spend all day reading or walking all alone, in silence, eight thousand miles away from everyone. All alone and unreachable in a foreign country is one my most favorite possible things to be.","If life gives you lemons, don't settle for simply making lemonade - make a glorious scene at a lemonade stand.","When I diagnose my depression now, I think it was partially about saying goodbye to these kids that I always expected to have but already knew that I wouldn't.","Creativity itself doesn't care at all about results - the only thing it craves is the process. Learn to love the process and let whatever happens next happen, without fussing too much about it. Work like a monk, or a mule, or some other representative metaphor for diligence. Love the work. Destiny will do what it wants with you, regardless.","There were times, especially when I was traveling for 'Eat, Pray, Love,' when, I swear to God, I would feel this weight of my female ancestors, all those Swedish farmwives from beyond the grave who were like, 'Go! Go to Naples! Eat more pizza! Go to India, ride an elephant! Do it! Swim in the Indian Ocean. Read those books. Learn a language.'","I am far more of a loner than people would imagine. But I am the most gregarious and socially interactive loner you ever met. The thing is, I am fascinated by people's stories and I'm very talkative and can't ever say no to anything or anyone, so I tend to over-socialize, to give away too much of my time to the many people I adore.","When I look at my life and the lives of my female friends these days - with our dizzying number of opportunities and talents - I sometimes feel as though we are all mice in a giant experimental maze, scurrying around frantically, trying to find our way through.","But, ancient Greece and ancient Rome - people did not happen to believe that creativity came from human beings back then, OK? People believed that creativity was this divine attendant spirit that came to human beings from some distant and unknowable source, for distant and unknowable reasons.","Nobody until very recently would have thought that their husband was supposed to be their best friend, confidante, intellectual soul mate, co-parent, inspiration.","Unfenced by law, the unmarried lover can quit a bad relationship at any time. But you - the legally married person who wants to escape doomed love - may soon discover that a significant portion of your marriage contract belongs to the State, and that it sometimes takes a very long while for the State to grant you your leave.","If you are given only one opportunity to speak, be certain your voice is heard.","Absolute certainty is not something I strive for anymore. I've learned the hard way that destiny usually looks upon our most strident convictions with amusement, or perhaps even pity.","There's no reason to keep a piece of furniture in your house that is so sacred and rare that you can't put your feet up on it and a dog can't jump up on it. Likewise, a book that sits on a shelf like a piece of porcelain, only to be admired, never to be read again, is a dead book.","If I am to truly become an autonomous woman, then I must take over that role of being my own guardian.","I push every day against forces that say you have to go faster, be more effective, be more productive, you have to constantly outdo yourself, you have to constantly outdo your neighbor - all of the stuff that creates an incredibly productive society, but also a very neurotic one.","I have these new policies toward my life, like 'I will not accelerate when I see the yellow light.'","I don't think you can come into your wisdom until you have made mistakes on your own skin and felt them in reality of your own life.","I was a bartender for a long time, so I know how to make drinks, but I'm more likely to offer them than to have them. I think this is one of the reasons why I get to live longer than my great-grandmother did, and why I get to produce more writing than she did, and why my marriage isn't in dire straits.","You know, I think that allowing somebody, one mere person to believe that he or she is like, the vessel you know, like the font and the essence and the source of all divine, creative, unknowable, eternal mystery is just a smidge too much responsibility to put on one fragile, human psyche. It's like asking somebody to swallow the sun.","I know I'm not a self-indulgent idiot; I also know I'm not the second coming of Deepak Chopra. If I had believed either of those, or both, as some people do when they get famous, that's when the mental illness arrives.","If I could read while I was driving, showering, socializing or sleeping, I would do it.","Now, if you are like me - if you are like practically anybody in America - then you probably hold some negative opinions about the French, based upon movies, rumors, recent headlines, unfortunate run-ins with Parisian waiters, or... you know... all that unpleasantness surrounding the Vichy regime.","Here's the thing: the unit of reverence in Europe is the family, which is why a child born today of unmarried parents in Sweden has a better chance of growing up in a house with both of his parents than a child born to a married couple in America. Here we revere the couple, there they revere the family.","Men go into marriage with virtually no expectations whatsoever. Ten years later, the men are delightfully surprised to find out that it's actually kind of nice, and the women have sort of had to take a nose dive from what they thought it was going to be.","I consider a good dinner party at our house to be where people drink and eat more than they're meant to. My husband is a really fantastic cook. His mother is Italian and if you walk into our house, we assume you're starving.","Mine is just a simple old human story - of one person trying, with great rigor and discipline, to comprehend her personal relationship with divinity.","Childlessness doesn't make people selfish; selfishness makes people selfish.","Most important, though, I had to wait until I found the perfect traveling/eating/drinking/napping companion. And I did finally find him, two years ago - my Brazilian-born, French-speaking, wine-worshipping, tripe-consuming, uncomplaining traveler of a sweetheart.","I think sometimes we look at other people's marriages and we think they must always be so happy together. I don't know anybody who's married for a long time who hasn't somehow made room in their love story for the hate and resentment that they sometimes feel toward each other.","Which is - you know, like check it out, I'm pretty young, I'm only about 40 years old. I still have maybe another four decades of work left in me. And it's exceedingly likely that anything I write from this point forward is going to be judged by the world as the work that came after the freakish success of my last book, right?","But when it comes to writing the thing that I've sort of been thinking about lately, is why? You know, is it rational? Is it logical that anybody should be expected to be afraid of the work that they feel they were put on this Earth to do.","I should just put it bluntly, because we're all sort of friends here now - it's exceedingly likely that my greatest success is behind me. Oh, so Jesus, what a thought! You know that's the kind of thought that could lead a person to start drinking gin at nine o'clock in the morning, and I don't want to go there.","You know, even I have had work or ideas come through me from a source that I honestly cannot identify. And what is that thing? And how are we to relate to it in a way that will not make us lose our minds, but, in fact, might actually keep us sane?","I have a rigid self-accountability. You have to work hard.","When somebody has an enormous success in this culture, people start asking two questions, which are 'What are you doing now?' and 'How are you going to beat that?' And I have to say, I love the assumption that your intention is to beat yourself constantly - that you're in battle against yourself.","I used to say, 'Man, I think I'd be a really good dad. I'll be a great provider. I'm funny; I'll go on trips with them - I'll do all sorts of stuff.' But the momming? I'm not made for that. I have a really good mom; I know what she put into it.","Sureness is something like a neck brace, which we clamp around our lives, hoping to somehow protect ourselves from the frightening, constant whiplash of change. Sadly, the brace doesn't always hold.","These days I settle for feeling only 85 percent sure about most things, most of the time. I believe this is keeping me sane, and I also believe that it's keeping me human. In fact, I'm 85 percent sure of it.","Despite having written five books, I worry that I have not written the right kinds of books, or that perhaps I have dedicated too much of my life to writing, and have therefore neglected other aspects of my being.","I've always considered myself lucky that I do not have many passions. There's only one pursuit that I have ever truly loved, and that pursuit is writing. This means, conveniently enough, that I never had to search for my destiny; I only had to obey it.","My whole life I've been an over-giver. My general operating policy has always been, 'If it belongs to me, don't worry: You can have it!'","Listen - of course money changes everything, but so does sunlight, and so does food: These are powerful but neutral energy sources, neither inherently good nor evil but shaped only by the way we use them.","When I lost my friends, it was because I had used the power of giving on them recklessly. I swept into their lives with my big fat checkbook, and I erased years of obstacles for them overnight - but sometimes, in the process, I also accidentally erased years of dignity.","Nothing in the last few years has dazzled me more than Hilary Mantel's 'Wolf Hall,' which blew the top of my head straight off. I've read it three times, and I'm still trying to figure out how she put that magnificent thing together.","Every few years, I think, 'Maybe now I'm finally smart enough or sophisticated enough to understand 'Ulysses.' So I pick it up and try it again. And by page 10, as always, I'm like, 'What the hell?'","My husband is not American. He was born in Brazil, where he grew up under a filthy, corrupt dictatorship. In his twenties, he moved to Europe, where he lived for a while under various socialist democracies. He spent a few years on a kibbutz in Israel, living out a utopian experiment in communal existence.","That is who Barack Obama is - a person of admirable character - and that is who he has remained for me over these last four years. I have not agreed with his every decision, but never once have I seen him break his cool, lose his composure, or abandon his insightful perspective - even during the most serious and/or absurd national disasters.","My writing practice taught me the important thing is steadfastness. It's not necessarily discipline. Discipline can become a prison. When your spiritual practices become another thing for you to be anxious about, they've lost their usefulness.","You know, why at the end of your life should you assemble thousands of pages of 'Why am I so sad, why am I so depressed?' Instead, assemble thousands of pages of why you're so content.","My career started young and I was really ambitious, and then I had success and I hung out with people who were much older. I think I might have been temporally misplaced, so I thought I was 40. It was a premature midlife crisis.","I've always been afraid of saying no to people because I don't want them to be disappointed and dislike me.","I have no business being a journalist. I'm the least, I'm the least - I'm the most trusting, I absolutely make a habit of believing anything that anybody tells me about themselves. I've never had any reason in the world to think that anyone has wanted to harm me, or lie to me. I believe whatever is being sold, most of the time.","Sanity and clarity are more important for me and I'm willing to give up a lot of shimmer for it. I'm willing to have more boring friends, who are sane.","I'm a pleaser. That's my character.","I was a writer before 'Eat, Pray, Love,' and I'll be a writer after it's over. It's what I want to do for the rest of my life.","I think that people who live in cultures without quite so much privilege, opportunity or grandiosity have a little bit more respect for the workings of destiny, and the limitations that people can find themselves in through no fault of their own.","I feel like there are women who are genuinely born to be mothers, and women who are born to be aunties, and women who really probably not should be allowed near children. The tragedy that happens is when any one of those women ends up in the wrong category.","Part of the elasticity that you need, in order to continue to try to create, is the foregone conclusion that not all of it is going to be fabulously successful. But it's all going to be part of a long lifetime body of experimentation.","There are times when the only access I have to the truest person that I am is when I'm alone and trying to solve a sentence. It's exciting, even when it's frustrating, even when I can't do it right.","I myself have never been enchanted by the dream of the white wedding, and, heaven help us, the expectation that this exquisitely catered event should be 'the happiest moment' of one's life.","I think it's unfortunate that there exists only one path in America to complete social legitimacy, and that is marriage. I think, for instance, that it would be far easier for Americans to elect a black president or a female president than an unmarried president.","What I think is amazing is not that 85% of people who get married under the age of 25 get divorced, it's that 15% of them stay together. How did they manage to pull that off? You almost can't wait too long. It's the single simplest measure to predict divorce.","Marriage is not simply a romantic union between two people; it's also a political and economic contract of the highest order.","I think a lot of people who feel as though they desperately want to be married oftentimes simply desperately want to have a wedding.","We set up one rule in our house, which is, 'Guests of guests cannot bring guests.' That rule was required because that happened one weekend, and we finally said, 'Okay, you know what? That's a little too much.'","And we have a little herb garden, which survived the winter thanks to global warming. It makes me feel like a cool, old Italian housewife, that I kept my rosemary alive outside all winter.","I don't hate humanity and I'm not interested in people who do. Although, it's funny, actually, some of my favorite writers really do. Like Martin Amis. My dirty secret. 'London Fields' is one of my favorite books ever. And it's indefensible! But he's so funny... I forgive him everything.","I've come to realize that the contemporary creative culture is not generating the best possible outcome.","It's not an accident that both my sister and I are writers. Our parents created an accidental Petri dish. My family has great storytellers, and I grew up in a very funny, conversational house and didn't have television. This small family farm was a bubble world that didn't have much to do with reality."],"Elizabeth Gillies":["A strong sense of humor, a really awesome personality, and maturity is also really important in a boyfriend. I tend to only be attracted to older guys for that reason. I just love guys who have a really strong sense of who they are.","Hopefully, after 'Victorious' has lived a long and beautiful life, I would like to go into movies. And I'd like to have a very successful movie career. Ultimately I'd love to win an Oscar; that's my big goal in life, so that's what I'm going for.","Once you lose the honesty in a relationship, I mean, I think you don't have a relationship at all.","The food I eat the most is probably steamed, plain white rice. I know its really, really, really boring, but that's honestly the food I eat the most. No, I like cucumber avocado rolls... I love that.","If someone's being less than courteous to you, I don't think you need to pay any attention to them.","In middle school, I was boy crazy and it was the worst! I would always lose, too. I was more into the competition than the boy by the end of it! I just wanted to win!","I think dealing with mean girls is just a part of life. I never really took people like that too seriously.","My two big date deal breakers are someone with no sense of humor and someone who chews badly. I will never be with someone who never laughs or someone who chews disgustingly, so if either of those things are detected on a date - it's a total deal breaker.","I try not to tweet too much; I'm a really sporadic tweeter. I will tweet nonstop for, like, 3 days, and then I won't for a month. I don't make it priority at all; if I feel like doing it, I do it, and if not, then I don't care.","If you're passionate about something and stick with it, even if your friends aren't doing it, it'll pay off. It can be really rewarding to stick to your guns.","I love being a teen because you don't have all the responsibilities of an adult yet.","I like growing up; I feel like I have an old soul. I like the age to match as much as it can.","The funny thing about voice over is you can go in in sweatpants and have your hair all messed up, and no one will see you, and you can still deliver the same great product."],"Elizabeth Goudge":["Faith given back to us after a night of doubt is a stronger thing, and far more valuable to us than faith that has never been tested.","Most of the basic truths of life sound absurd at first hearing.","All we are asked to bear we can bear."],"Elizabeth Hand":["I still love it. I love lots of other music, too, and always have, but punk's the soundtrack of my youth. I think you never escape the music you're listening to and seeing when you're seventeen, eighteen, nineteen years old.","I've always wanted to write an airport book.","I read '1984' at a precocious age, like 8, and when I did the math, I realized that Julia, Winston Smith's lover, was born the same year I was, 1957. I read that book over and over again with the 1960s as a backdrop: anti-war and anti-bomb protests and this general pervasive sense of doom.","I was a tomboy as a kid - I was skinny and had cropped hair and was often mistaken for a boy - and up until I was about six, I had my own very fluid ideas of gender in that I believed that, somehow, an individual could choose whether or not s/he wanted to be a boy or a girl.","I didn't read much SF as a kid - I was a total Tolkien geek - but I started reading Samuel Delany and Angela Carter and Ursula LeGuin in high school, and I was definitely taken with the notion that here was a literature that could explore various notions of gender identity and how it affects the culture at large.","I love artists. I find them fascinating. To me, there really is a genuine magic in what they do."],"Elizabeth Hardwick":["The fifties - they seem to have taken place on a sunny afternoon that asked nothing of you except a drifting belief in the moment and its power to satisfy.","The language of the younger generation has the brutality of the city and an assertion of threatening power at hand, not to come. It is military, theatrical, and at its most coherent probably a lasting repudiation of empty courtesy and bureaucratic euphemism.","Adversity is a great teacher, but this teacher makes us pay dearly for its instruction; and often the profit we derive, is not worth the price we paid.","I am alone here in New York, no longer a we.","Books give not wisdom where none was before. But where some is, there reading makes it more.","Nature should have been pleased to have made this age miserable, without making it also ridiculous.","The greatest gift is a passion for reading. It is cheap, it consoles, it distracts, it excites, it gives you knowledge of the world and experience of a wide kind. It is a moral illumination."],"Elizabeth Holmes":["Fundamentally, the answers to our challenges in healthcare relies in engaging and empowering the individual.","With some diseases, like type 2 diabetes, if people get alerted early, they can take steps to avert getting sick.","Today, blood work and science are able to provide more of a movie of your health, identifying trends before they become an issue.","What I really want out of life is to discover something new: something mankind didn't know was possible to do.","The art of phlebotomy originated with bloodletting in 1400 B.C., and the modern clinical lab emerged in the 1960s - and it has not fundamentally evolved since then. You go in, sit down, they put a tourniquet on your arm, stick you with a needle, take these tubes and tubes of blood.","The right to protect the health and well-being of every person, of those we love, is a basic human right.","No one thinks of the lab-testing experience as positive. It should be! One way to create that is to help people engage with the data once their physicians release it. You can't do that if you don't really understand why you're getting certain tests done and when you don't know what the results mean when you get them back.","We know more about our credit cards than we know about our bodies.","Patients are empowered by having better access to their own health information, and then by owning their own data.","I definitely am afraid of needles. It's the only thing that actually scares me.","It drives me crazy when people talk about the scale as an indicator of health, because your weight doesn't tell you what's going on at a biochemical level.","My father did a lot of disaster relief work, and he was always in places where there was a lot of pain.","When I thought about having the greatest impact with my life, I thought about all the times people lose loved ones because diseases weren't detected early enough. I thought, 'I can play a role there.'","Too often you see someone fall, break a rib, go in to the doctor and discover a tumor.","I think a lot of young people have incredible ideas and incredible insights, but sometimes they wait before they go give their life to something. What I did was just to start a little earlier.","I really believe that if we were from another planet, and we sat down to put our heads together on torture experiments, the concept of sticking a needle into someone and sucking their blood out would probably qualify as a pretty good one.","Thernos 1.0 is an external point-of-care BlackBerry.","Anywhere from 40% to 60% of people, when they're given a requisition by a doctor to go get tested, don't, because they're scared of needles or the locations are inconvenient or the cost is too high. And if you're not even getting tested, how is it possible that we're going to move toward an era of preventive medicine?","I love adventures.","At a relatively early age, I began to believe that building a business was perhaps the greatest opportunity for making an impact, because it's a tool for making a change in the world."],"Elizabeth Hurley":["Spending time outdoors makes you feel great.","You know, you want to be a success. You want people to know who you are.","It took me six years to be comfortable modeling a swimsuit.","Breast cancer is being detected at an earlier, more treatable stage these days, largely because women are taking more preventive measures, like self-exams and regular mammograms. And treatment is getting better too.","I would seriously question whether anybody is really foolish enough to really say what they mean. Sometimes I think that civilization as we know it would kind of break down if we all were completely honest.","Nothing irritates me more than chronic laziness in others. Mind you, it's only mental sloth I object to. Physical sloth can be heavenly.","A bit of lusting after someone does wonders for the skin.","I love moving. I love new houses. I'm always looking for somewhere else.","Getting as much sleep as possible and following a healthy diet will stop you from feeling run-down if, like me, you're super-stressed.","I always found when I was reading an interview with an actor that I wasn't interested in their political opinions - I just wanted to know what they'd had for breakfast.","I've always wanted to be a spy, and frankly I'm a little surprised that British intelligence has never approached me.","I certainly don't want a child of mine to be famous, or anyone I was very close to who isn't yet... It's the worst thing to be trapped in your house not be able to leave.","I'd kill myself if I was as fat as Marilyn Monroe.","Being English, I always laugh at anything to do with the lavatory or bottoms.","I keep getting these extraordinary letteres, really weird ones from American sports stars - I've always thought you were one pretty lady and now that you're single I want to meet you for a drink.","I was completely loyal and faithful to Stephen throughout this time as, indeed, he assured me he was to me.","The only meal I have is dinner.","In America uniformed cops eat in coffee shops, diners and restaurants and I always feel safer having them around.","I'm pretty nice. I'm far from an ax murderer. I've never been mean to anyone in my life.","What I really, really want to do is pre-packaged meals. Fabulous versions that are delicious, healthy, not too expensive and very low in fat. So, that's my big dream, because there's a massive hole in the market for that.","I think, if you were being cruel to animals, then the thought of eating them would be horrific.","I feel like a semi-single mum.","I'm not going to launch a bikini business and then give up bikinis, am I?","It's definitely part of my job description not to be too fat.","I'm very attracted to Indians.","I am a terrible mixture of being organized, controlling, but chaotic. My desk is monstrous.","I didn't have a cup of coffee until I was 27.","I do like my life very much, yes.","You know, I've virtually never been chatted up in my life, it's true.","I don't want someone to watch sports in bed. That drives me nuts.","I like people to match my energy.","I'm not that careful with cars.","It's very hard to get the dynamics where two people can stimulate each other and be happy.","I'm manic about my schedule.","I know so many people who have battled breast cancer and they didn't all make it.","I am passionate about talking to women about their breast health.","I always wear make-up as I've never seen the point of looking less than your best.","I walk every day with my dogs and force myself to run a bit but I hate it.","I don't know much about only children. I was the middle one of three, and if ever I was alone with mum and dad, it was a rare moment.","I've always been obsessed by beef jerky.","When I started doing movies, every crew member was older than me.","I love pilates and yoga but don't do them regularly.","We all need to relax more, but I don't find it easy.","I love to see other women in pink. It's good for every shade of skin and hair.","I have always been attracted to Australians and Australia.","Divorce is, of course, difficult for a child. I didn't go through it as my parents stayed together, but I have a lot of friends who did.","The day of the press statement has gone."],"Elizabeth I":["I would rather be a beggar and single than a queen and married.","I do not want a husband who honours me as a queen, if he does not love me as a woman.","A clear and innocent conscience fears nothing.","There is one thing higher than Royalty: and that is religion, which causes us to leave the world, and seek God.","I know I have the body of a weak and feeble woman, but I have the heart and stomach of a king, and of a king of England too.","Do not tell secrets to those whose faith and silence you have not already tested.","I would rather go to any extreme than suffer anything that is unworthy of my reputation, or of that of my crown.","God has given such brave soldiers to this Crown that, if they do not frighten our neighbours, at least they prevent us from being frightened by them.","Fear not, we are of the nature of the lion, and cannot descend to the destruction of mice and such small beasts.","I have the heart of a man, not a woman, and I am not afraid of anything.","Brass shines as fair to the ignorant as gold to the goldsmiths.","Though the sex to which I belong is considered weak you will nevertheless find me a rock that bends to no wind.","The past cannot be cured.","One man with a head on his shoulders is worth a dozen without.","God forgive you, but I never can.","There is nothing about which I am more anxious than my country, and for its sake I am willing to die ten deaths, if that be possible.","I do not so much rejoice that God hath made me to be a Queen, as to be a Queen over so thankful a people.","I shall lend credit to nothing against my people which parents would not believe against their own children.","A fool too late bewares when all the peril is past.","It is a natural virtue incident to our sex to be pitiful of those that are afflicted.","The end crowneth the work.","To be a king and wear a crown is a thing more glorious to them that see it than it is pleasant to them that bear it.","The stone often recoils on the head of the thrower.","A strength to harm is perilous in the hand of an ambitious head.","I pray to God that I shall not live one hour after I have thought of using deception.","Where minds differ and opinions swerve there is scant a friend in that company.","If thy heart fails thee, climb not at all.","Monarchs ought to put to death the authors and instigators of war, as their sworn enemies and as dangers to their states.","I do not choose that my grave should be dug while I am still alive.","I find that I sent wolves not shepherds to govern Ireland, for they have left me nothing but ashes and carcasses to reign over!","Though I am not imperial, and though Elizabeth may not deserve it, the Queen of England will easily deserve to have an emperor's son to marry.","Those who appear the most sanctified are the worst.","If we still advise we shall never do.","He who placed me in this seat will keep me here.","Where might is mixed with wit, there is too good an accord in a government.","All my possessions for a moment of time.","Must! Is must a word to be addressed to princes? Little man, little man! Thy father, if he had been alive, durst not have used that word.","My mortal foe can no ways wish me a greater harm than England's hate; neither should death be less welcome unto me than such a mishap betide me.","The word must is not to be used to princes.","Ye may have a greater prince, but ye shall never have a more loving prince."],"Elizabeth Jagger":["Never dress older than you are! The five wardrobe items you must have are a nice pair of well-fitting shoes, pajamas, sexy yet comfortable lingerie, a party dress in a bold colour and a jumpsuit.","On bad days, I like to wear something colourful so I strike attention. That's how I appear confident to others - and how I get confident.","'Finnegans Wake,' 'Alice and Wonderland' and 'Through the Looking Glass' live on my bedside table back home in London.","I do believe that if models look like children, then they shouldn't be sexualised.","People tell me that I should eat more, but they don't know me: I eat a lot. It's pretty unpleasant that people assume every model is anorexic and bulimic.","I thought that the fashion world could be a bit fake sometimes, but it's nothing compared to Hollywood. These girls would walk over their grandmothers' graves to get a part, and the producers talk about actresses like they're dirt, picking over every part of them so that they end up paranoid and having surgery.","My parents have influenced my fashion choices. I inherited many of their older garments, and I like their style. I love my mother's elegant and dramatic couture dresses and the feeling for colour my father has.","I don't tweet. I prefer face-to-face communication and sometimes Instagram.","People assume that because I was brought up on Rolling Stones tours, and my father is who he is, I'm some kind of rock-and-roll bad girl."],"Elizabeth Janeway":["Growing up human is uniquely a matter of social relations rather than biology. What we learn from connections within the family takes the place of instincts that program the behavior of animals; which raises the question, how good are these connections?","As long as mixed grills and combination salads are popular, anthologies will undoubtedly continue in favor.","Like their personal lives, women's history is fragmented, interrupted; a shadow history of human beings whose existence has been shaped by the efforts and the demands of others."],"Elizabeth Jennings":["I hate a word like 'pets': it sounds so much Like something with no living of its own.","For me, poetry is always a search for order."],"Elizabeth Joan Smith":["No woman has an abortion for fun.","When religious leaders get involved in elections, it is usually with a reactionary social agenda.","It's just so hard sometimes to work out where people stand on these things. I mean, isn't the Pope a feminist?","We are making gods out of global celebrities.","There is a gulf between the high value Americans put on life in theory and its cheapness in practice."],"Elizabeth Kapu'uwailani Lindsey":["We live in a society bloated with data yet starved for wisdom. We're connected 24/7, yet anxiety, fear, depression and loneliness is at an all-time high. We must course-correct.","True navigation begins in the human heart. It's the most important map of all.","From the boardroom to the bedroom, we're connected 24/7, yet loneliness is at an all-time high. More people are reaching for mobile devices than for the hand of someone in need. Where did our humanity go?","I believe that when an elder dies, a library is burned: vast sums of wisdom and knowledge are lost. Throughout the world libraries are ablaze with scant attention.","All of us want to be better. Human nature is always seeking advancement.","My work is as an ethnographic rescuer: a conduit between past and future generations. The urgency of this effort cannot be overstated.","As a child, I was raised by native Hawaiian elders - three old women who took care of me while my parents worked.","For centuries, cultures throughout the world have used indigenous technologies to navigate life's complexities. From navigator-priests in Micronesia to mystics in India, vast sums of knowledge are available if we but recognize it."],"Elizabeth Kenny":["It's better to be a lion for a day than a sheep all your life.","He who angers you conquers you.","At first, I was called a quack, a charlatan, and worse, year after year, in Australia, England and the United States, by men who simply refused to believe that a nurse from 'the bush' could devise a treatment which succeeded where they had failed.","I do not want medical men to discuss whether or not my work is valuable, because I know what it will do. I want them to tell me how best this new knowledge of rapidly restoring paralysed people to health and strength can be applied where it is needed.","Some minds remain open long enough for the truth not only to enter but to pass on through by way of a ready exit without pausing anywhere along the route.","I have a message to give to the world, and I shall not be thwarted.","The American doctor, in my opinion, possesses a combination of conservatism and that other quality which has put the United States in the forefront in almost every department of science - that is, an eagerness to know what it is really all about in order that he may not be the one left behind if there is something to it.","'O sleep, O gentle sleep,' I thought gratefully, 'Nature's soft nurse!'","I spent more time on dark ships in danger zones than any other woman in the world.","In the history of medicine, it is not always the great scientist or the learned doctor who goes forward to discover new fields, new avenues, new ideas.","Panic plays no part in the training of a nurse.","I came to America to teach my method - not to enter a research experiment."],"Elizabeth Kostova":["I wasn't brought up to be dazzled by money or fame.","For me, Dracula has always been associated with travel and beautiful historical places.","I think it's important to recognise that 'The Da Vinci Code' opened up a vast new audience for a general readership interested in historical detective stories and research into history.","Every writer hopes his or her book will be its own thing.","No book that is written for an external purpose is going to be a passionately felt book for the writer or the reader. I don't see the point in doing that.","I love to cook and I've cooked a lot of Bulgarian food over the years.","Bulgarians eat tarator every single day in summer. They think of it as salad although we'd call it a soup. You can make it as thick or thin as you like depending on how much water you add. It's very practical in summer because yogurt cools the body faster than water, but the water hydrates you.","My publishers are wonderful because they have let me write what I wanted to. They're wise enough to know that, with any author who's not simply writing formulas - who's trying to create something new - pressuring them to do something for market purposes almost always backfires. I can't imagine working under those circumstances, actually.","Sometimes people damage paintings or sculpture because they love it. They throw their arms around a statue in a fit of hysterical passion and it falls over.","I keep telling myself I should try very hard to write a novel of about 210 pages... I don't seem to be capable of it, but I keep hoping it will happen."],"Elizabeth Marshall Thomas":["Besides individual things like thunder and gunshots, what dogs fear most is not belonging, being alone.","Hundreds of species are facing extinction due to human impacts on the environment.","I always thought of deer as solitary animals that weren't very interesting. But my goodness, that was very wrong. The big eye-opener for me was that they're social. They have family groups.","We may never find a way to live in suburbia with deer as we do with raccoons, say, or squirrels. So for this reason, it's very important that we make sure always to save enough wild or open land so that they can live in their normal manner.","In my cosmology, indigenous wild deer are more important than exotic ornamental shrubs.","You can look at your dog and see that it's thinking and has strong feelings. And if it does, so do wolves. And if wolves do, so do elephants. People aren't the only beings that think and feel.","From the very dawn of time until now and well into the future... human-animal companionship is at the very core of our instincts not only for mutual survival, but mutually rewarding relationships.","No other creatures of the savannah sleep as deeply or as soundly as lions, but after all, lions are the main reason for not sleeping soundly.","We fill the woods with invasive primates camouflaged to look like piles of leaves who sneak around, sprinkling estrus doe urine and manipulating gadgets that sound like antlers clashing.","With all due respect to the nation's fish and game departments, more deer die because people hunt them than because people feed them.","Many expressions of a cat's feelings seem deeply related to the capture of live prey.","We are surely the primary agent of death for all members of the cat tribe. For many if not most cat species, our depredations must surpass accidents, disease, and even starvation by a considerable margin.","The story of cats is a story of meat.","People are perfectly glad to accept the idea that dogs love us, so they must be able to love each other.","Dogs are a window on the natural world.","You have to be able to love members of your own species before you can branch out and apply that to other species.","Once you're known to be an alcoholic, that's how many people identify you, which could be a reason not to talk about it.","Not even a maggot is an it, and to refer to any animal in that manner is an affectation, an ignorant stab at science-speak.","Animals need to understand other species, if only to prey on them or escape from them.","Every dog might wish to be Dog One, but like us, most dogs want membership in the group even more than they want supremacy over others.","Dogs who live in each other's company are calm and pragmatic, never showing the desperate need to make known their needs and feelings or to communicate their observations, as some hysterical dogs who know only the company of our species are likely to do.","Primates feel pure, flat immobility as boredom. But dogs feel it as peace.","Every day, the humane societies execute thousands of dogs who tried all their lives to do their very best by their owners. These dogs are killed not because they are bad but because they are inconvenient. So as we need God more than he needs us, dogs need us more than we need them, and they know it.","I would like to visit a dog's mind to know what he's thinking and feeling.","When I was very young, my nanny was a big Newfoundland dog... whose task was to keep me from drowning.","People acquire a dog, don't understand it, can't train it, get fed up, and... offer it for adoption, hoping to pass on the problem to somebody else. But nobody wants a problem dog.","Dogs like to learn stuff, if not from another dog, then people are OK... They love activity, playing, interesting walks, and just belonging, being together.","To sit idly, not doing, merely experiencing, comes hard to a primate.","Veterinarians are essential allies to the millions of us who experience the human-animal bond.","All the members of the dog family - domestic dogs, wolves, coyotes, dingoes - are very aware of territory. A group must control its own territory - you can't have others taking it from you, because then you won't have enough food.","People didn't think animals thought or remembered or had minds! They most certainly do: any pet owner knows more than a lot of scientists about animals.","When I write about animals, I use anthropological techniques and the language you would use for a person. You don't have to anthropomorphize animals, just acknowledge their individuality.","The relationships we have with dogs seem simple enough and often are taken for granted. But these relationships can be deep and mysterious, and not at all simple.","As far as I'm concerned, I own my dogs as I own my body. My legs are with me when I take a shower, and I feel no shame. If I were to lose one, I'd grieve, and people would send sympathy cards, but it would be my condition that evoked the sympathy, not the fate of the leg. That's like losing a dog.","The dogs and I are a single thing, and thus we share our interests. With them, I'm bigger and better than I am without them, and vice versa.","This was what you did in the '50s: You get married, get a job, put your husband through graduate school, and have two kids - a girl and a boy.","Barring some competition from whales, wolves are probably America's most popular wild animal. Wolves are also contenders for America's most unpopular wild animal, with perhaps some competition from coyotes.","When we became sedentary, lived indoors, and started to raise livestock, we began to see wolves not as occasional fur-bearers or fellow hunters but as robbers.","One of the best and most responsible things a scientist can do is to write for the popular press.","We used to go in the woods by ourselves, and you can't help noticing the world then, especially animals. People used to know a lot about the natural world, especially in the country.","If you don't have manufactured items or anything we think of as 'civilization,' then you're living according to your species.","Cats and dogs are a very good window into the natural world: a chance to see how another species lives and deals with its problems, what they like and what they don't like.","I don't mind aging - I'm glad to be aging. I'll never die young."],"Elizabeth Marvel":["How do you stand tall and strong as a woman while trying to be the smartest woman in the room and try to remain non-threatening?","I see artists as the first responders. And when the proverbial crap hits the fan, we are there to be of service, to tell the story, to bring a balm, to soothe, to provide catharsis. You know, not to make our work any more important or less important, but just that there is a great importance to it.","I was a spooky kid; that was just my nature.","The audience has its own gestalt, and it becomes another character - a character that changes each night.","I never had any preconceived ideas about acting, because I always thought I was going to be a visual artist.","When I finished high school, I didn't have much direction - I was a Deadhead kid who ended up bumming around London seeing a lot of theater. That's where I saw the performance that made me want to act: Vanessa Redgrave doing 'A Touch of the Poet.'","My God, I have so much bounty in my life.","I'm dying for people to let me be funny!","I think being a mom changed me, and now it's not just about what I want to do and what's sort of interesting, but what I absolutely have to do.","If I'm asking people to give me two hours of their time, it's because I really feel like they need to listen to what the writer is talking about.","When I was nursing my son, you're up all the time during the first year, and you're sort of brain dead. So I'd find myself watching Turner Classic Movies at odd hours.","I love seeing people in their mess. I find that heartwarming. Charm just doesn't interest me. If I want to see charming people, I can watch TV.","Trying to find a way to represent something that is truly frightening on stage is a fascinating challenge.","Whenever I approach any character, I try to find examples to draw upon.","As an actress, you have to be very naive.","I've been told I'm bright. But when I act, I get incredibly stupid. I feel my intellect slowing down. I feel it happening physically. And that's not negative in acting!","There comes a point in any project where you have to say - whether you like or understand the character, or the whole play for that matter - 'I believe!'","There are lots of rats. It's a dirty little secret at the Delacorte Theatre.","If someone can make money from you, you can do more things, and eventually, you can do things you come up with.","I think every actor has those performances they've seen, the person who made them realize that's what they wanted to do.","In some ways, I missed my era because I'm big and messy and have big feelings and take up space on a stage rather than being diminutive and childlike in my woman-ness.","Tim Burton is an artist who has had a huge influence on me. I definitely share his sensibility. It's a joyful approach to darkness.","When I work onstage, I want to play roles that have real, deep theatricality, that aren't the sort you would easily see on television and in the movies.","I've been around the block.","I'm not familiar with an unaccepting family. But in my profession, nothing can be foreign.","We have to be able to use our imaginations to make the character's experiences real to us.","I will happily work anywhere they need me to if they pay me well.","The first play I ever did was with Michael Langham, Brian Bedford, and Colm Feore, at Stratford Festival. That was my first professional job, and I got to work with Garland Wright and so many great artists.","Personally, I don't want to do theater that's very stylish, when it's just stories on stage that are basically the same as TV or film.","I see a lot of art; we see a lot of music, films at Sundance... that influences me and informs me more than theater just because I make a bigger effort to see other art forms.","I just love the idea of doing an all-female play on Broadway.","I know all my tricks, and I'm pretty bored with them, so if that's all someone wants, I'd rather wait for TV money and not work so hard.","Every time I do a play, I'm like, 'When do I get to do the one where I wear a gown, sit in a chair, and say funny things?' I'd love to do that.","I have no ability or interest to play that weak, beaten person.","It's really interesting because I'm a Quaker... so it's been radical to me to be hired by the Department of Defense under contract.","I don't believe in saying no.","You always hear about the disempowered actor, their fate in other people's hands. It's just really wonderful to experience it the other way around.","We are in this amazing age of television where there's an incredible amount and an incredible quality of television, of long-form narrative.","You talk through what exactly happened to Howard Dean on the campaign trail, what Bill Clinton must have lived through, what the daily grind of doing what these people have to do. And they can never lose their temper, they can never be tired, and they can never slip up, or it's on-camera, and it's everywhere - and it's over.","I was in several Shakespeare in the Park productions in my younger years, but I've been busy with other things for a while.","Who wouldn't want to play the leader of the free world?","I get to play a lot of powerful, smartest women in the room. And that's deeply satisfying.","I have to say, it seems to be the older I get, the better the work gets. When has that been true?","If you can see it, you can be it. And I believe in that.","I went to an art school in high school and got in a little trouble like you do when you're a teenager and not being closely supervised. I did. I followed the Dead around, and it was fun. It was great. It was kind and sweet and lovely.","You know, the '80s, as crazy as the '80s were, that was a surprisingly kind and generous environment that I found myself in as a teenager.","I ended up landing in London out of high school, and I saw a performance that Vanessa Redgrave gave, just because it was a cheap ticket, and I didn't know what to do with my afternoon, and I went in, and I saw this Eugene O'Neill play, and I sat in the fifth row, and I watched her.","I don't look presidential. I don't wear, you know, three-piece suits and have my hair perfectly coiffed.","I think there is a certain gravitas about me. My energy can be very big and yet contained.","By nature, my default place is a very introverted one, so it's funny to be in such an extroverted profession. I'm a little inappropriately in it.","I'm a hypervisual person.","It's all really nice to have my pretend Secret Service people paying me respect, but the moment I walk in the door, it's back to being 'Mom.'","OK, so I'm a working mom that also gets to kiss George Clooney. That's a little bit of a perk of the job."],"Elizabeth McCracken":["It's an amazing thing to watch a lizard fold a moth into its mouth, like a sword swallower who specialises in umbrellas.","I wanted to acknowledge that life goes on but that death goes on, too. A person who is dead is a long, long story.","I used to be a writer with superstitions worthy of a professional baseball player: I needed a certain desk chair and a certain armchair and a certain desk arrangement, and I could only get really useful work done between 8 P.M. and 3 A.M. Then I started to move, and I couldn't bring my chairs with me.","Acknowledgment of grief - well, it makes feeling the grief easier, not harder.","The walls of the Franciscan Church of the Assumption of the Holy Virgin Mary were ruined stucco chipping away from the brick underneath, with ghostly frescoes, concrete-filled niches, and one complete, vivid crucifix painted over the altar.","Remember that a woman who has given birth to a dead child has given birth and is recovering physically, too. Don't be afraid of grieving parents.","There's a good chance that in 40 years, after the floods, people zipping by on scavenged jetpacks with their scavenged baseball caps on backwards, I will be in my rocking chair saying bitterly, 'I remember when 'all right' was two words.'","I own an e-reader, but I use it almost exclusively to read things that aren't books - student theses, unbound galleys.","At my first library job, I worked with a woman named Sheila Brownstein, who was The Reader's Advisor. She was a short, bosomy Englishwoman who accosted people at the shelves and asked if they wanted advice on what to read, and if the answer was yes, she asked what writers they already loved and then suggested somebody new.","I like seeing my physical progress through a volume, particularly if it's a big book.","Revising stuff lately, I was shocked to see how often my characters scratched their ankles, felt their feet, and touched their own ears.","When it comes to other people's writing, my older influences are more powerful than more recent ones, partially because I'm now more worried that I'll suddenly accidentally steal something from another writer.","Life likes jokes; life is constantly making jokes, even at the most inopportune moments.","You write the way you think about the world. My motto in times of trouble - and I'm speaking of life, not writing - is 'no humor too black.'","Humor reminds you, when you're flattened by sorrow, that you're still human.","It's hard to know which made me more aware of the impossibility of protecting children - having a child die or having had two live.","Ordinarily, I'd claim that I'd never write directly about my children, but the opening conversation of 'Peter Elroy' is a verbatim conversation that my children had that I just loved: morbid, funny, passionate, and obsessed with the truth of things - all natural qualities of children that I'd like my work to contain.","You believe in God or statistics or the way your narrative differs from other people.","Sadness was something I was thinking about in my life outside of writing, so it wormed itself into whatever I wrote.","I have a memory of my fourth-grade self wanting to be the first woman president of the United States, but I think that has a lot more to do with my love of world records and reference books than a love of serving my country.","I've always been absolutely appalling about the future, but I sort of think that was my childhood religion. We were future deniers. You did your best in the present, which was all around you.","I feel like I don't understand time in novels, really. I bumble forward, is all.","When I tell people there are three stories in 'Thunderstruck' that were from the same wrecked novel, they want to guess what they are. Nobody has. There are no characters or timelines in common. They're structured very differently. A good novel wouldn't have pulled apart so easily.","Short fiction is like low relief. And if your story has no humor in it, then you're trying to look at something in the pitch dark. With the light of humor, it throws what you're writing into relief so that you can actually see it.","I can't imagine not joking even at the worst of times. And for me, it's sort of automatic.","I sort of don't believe in closure. In the sense that it doesn't make me feel better to think that something is over.","There are two MFA programs here at the University of Texas, and I read on the jury of both of them. And it's amazing to me how many really talented young writers seem to fear humor.","I am not a therapy person, but I understand what therapy does. It's a way of translating dark thoughts into something manageable.","When you've lost a baby, everyone around you expects you to be fine once the new baby is born, as though that somehow takes away the pain of losing the first child. I needed to express how wrong that was.","Once I started writing novels, I understood how hard it was to write really good short stories.","In 'Property,' none of the characters are based on any real people, but the house is very much the house that I moved into in Saratoga Springs, N.Y.","I always want the last line to be really good, which may sound silly, but I want it to be a last pleasing line.","When I was in college, I wrote poetry very seriously, and then once I had started writing short stories, I didn't go back to poetry, partially because I felt like I understood how incredibly difficult it was.","For about half an hour in mid-1992, I knew as much as any layperson about the pleasures of remote access of other people's computers.","In library science school, back in the years of glowing green non-graphical screens and protocols called Archie and Veronica, I wrote Internet documentation.","There were a lot of things I loved about working in a library, but mostly I miss the library patrons. I love books, but books are everywhere. Library patrons are as various and oddball and democratic as library books.","Tweeting about objects means I don't need to bid on them, which is a blessing. Buying something is a way of saying, 'Look at this!' So is tweeting. So, I guess, is writing fiction.","There was a time in my life when I wasn't sure I'd ever write a short story again because I had started writing novels, and I am fundamentally a lazy person, and the fact is that a novel is a lazy person's form, really. That is, you can amble; you can digress.","The thing that most interests me about writing - there are lots of things, but the thing I can't do without - is the hit of happiness a lovely sentence delivers.","I have been the person who tries to keep conversation light while talking to someone whose heart has been smashed.","In general, I think people are worried about saying the wrong thing to any grieving person. On a very basic level, I think they're frightened of touching off tears or sorrow, as though someone tearing up at the mention of unhappy news would be the mentioner's fault.","An iron lung looks like an enormous metal coffin or a 19th-century rocket ship: only its occupant's head is left outside, a tight seal around the neck.","A comic strip that your parents read when they were young is a curious thing: it's an heirloom, and it's also intimate. You peer through windows and look at the things that made your elders laugh, and then you wonder whether the laugh really belongs to you.","Some graphic narrative art presses against the panel: you wrestle with it at the level of the paper.","I work in my office on the campus of the University of Texas. It's the sort of place described as 'book-lined', but it's recently tipped over into 'fire-hazard' territory.","New Orleans is still the place where you find out that you have a doppelganger and feel lucky - but somehow unsurprised - to learn that his name is Mad Bottom.","When I first met my husband, he was sculpting Vilnius out of clay - a sort of Vilnius, anyhow: a map of an imaginary European city based on the Lithuanian capital - to illustrate his second novel.","My mother's family didn't speak much about Europe: My mother was born in 1935, and her new-world parents were the sort who didn't want to worry their children about the war.","Vilnius was once known as 'The Jerusalem of Lithuania' because of the number of prayer houses and scholars there; in the first half of the 20th century, it became a center of Yiddish-language scholarship.","I'm a higgledy-piggledy person in every way. On days that I work, I work for eight hours in a row, with my internet access entirely turned off, locked in my office.","I'm astounded by people who can listen to music when they write. I can only assume that they have multi-track brains, while mine is decidedly single.","In the last century, I earned my living as a librarian, and I loved it. I'd have to take some classes to get up to speed with 21st-century librarianship.","I have children, and this notion - that there might be a single book that introduces children to literature - terrifies me. But you could do worse than Mary Norton's 'The Borrowers.' I loved it as a kid, and my kids love it, too."],"Elizabeth McGovern":["In today's world, we all live with the burden of feeling that anything is possible if we're only clever enough, smart enough, work hard enough.","I like writing letters and receiving letters. It's a shame that we've lost the art of letter-writing and saving correspondence. I mourn that.","I had reconciled myself to being happily out to pasture, a bit.","My job now is to work hard and learn all I can.","We lack rituals in this modern world.","I've been in things that have impressed people and they've come up to congratulate you but in a kind of, you-must-think-you're-really-special way.","I wasn't ecstatic about being pregnant - I wasn't somebody who actively wanted kids. Certainly there were no fantasies about nappy-changing.","It's very tough when two creative people are together.","North Hollywood isn't actually Hollywood, it's in the San Fernando Valley... it's not the most glamorous part of L.A.","The way it works in Hollywood is that if you're hot it doesn't matter if you're right for the part or not, you're just offered it.","Hollywood never suited me, I didn't ever feel comfortable with it, it took me a couple of years but I found where I was always meant to be... Chiswick!","I turned down the opportunity to be in some films that went on to be blockbusters.","My father was an academic, an eccentric. He was a lecturer.","I'm someone who's done the opposite of whatever the received wisdom is, to keep your career going into your 50s.","I still feel I'm doing the same work I've always done.","So the English approach to show business and their work is more - and this is a big generalization, I hasten to say - but it's more, they work on it as a craft job.","England as a culture has endured so much more than America has as a culture, so it's given them a different perspective.","Most people grow up dreaming of going to Hollywood and some of them work and work and work and finally end up in Hollywood.","That feeling of being 19 or 20 and 'hot' in Hollywood was so intense.","I've got my private life - that's sacred - and I didn't have that before.","There is nothing in my life where I view myself as a 1920s person.","If I feel I can play a part I do everything in my power to try to play it.","It's peaceful for people to know how their lives are going to be, pretty much.","Now we have to contend with overstimulation and too many opportunities all the time, and too many decisions all the time.","Well, when I moved to England I was making a lot of personal adjustments because I was getting married and starting a family, that sort of thing.","I miss sometimes the buzz of America. A sense that anything can change at the drop of a hat. In a way, it's an exhausting thing to live with.","Honestly, I am always shocked when I see myself in the mirror because I feel exactly the same as I did when I was 18 getting off the plane to go to Juilliard in New York.","I can't just sit around thinking how lucky I am.","I just find it fascinating, like everybody, to be in a different life. It's an escape.","I love having the opportunity to explore a part for a great length of time, really get deeper and deeper into it, because you only have a chance to do that once or twice in a career.","Whenever I work on anything, there's always the fantasy that what one is doing is the next 'Citizen Kane'-slash-'Sopranos.'","Well, I have a band, Sadie and the Hotheads, and we have an album that is already out that is available on our website.","To me, the lyrics of the song define the kind of style it is.","My family were all into classical music, and I found that very intimidating.","I've found acting on stage much more challenging than on screen.","By definition, an actor's life is a recipe for regret. There are always roads you could have taken. But I've lived long enough to realise that each road has its own rewards.","As far as I can see women who have facelifts don't look younger, just weirder. You see them on screen with these tight, little porcelain faces - then the hand goes up to the face and it looks like it belongs to an alien. I find it really freaky.","In London, I take the Tube everywhere.","I have a terrible sense of direction.","I don't believe in villains - just people who channel their energy in the wrong way."],"Elizabeth Meriwether":["I think in a lot of romantic comedies it ends with a kiss, and I feel like in modern day relationships, and maybe just my own experience, it starts with a kiss and then all sort of falls apart and then comes together. You're texting. You're wondering what's going on. There's no definitions, there's no labels.","If I'm writing something and I'm not feeling mischievous, then I know it's not going to be great.","Every day, I learn something new. I think one of the most exciting things for a writer is to work on a TV show. It's like a novel. You have a really long time to develop and learn about the characters, and you can just really keep digging in deeper, every week.","I think they should create a holiday for friends-with-benefits relationships. Because I feel like Valentine's Day is, maybe it's a day to stay home and cry.","I think you have to love the characters that you write. I don't know how you could possibly write a TV show where you didn't love the characters.","I don't think anyone who runs a TV show would ever say to you, 'I have a grasp on running a TV show.' Maybe that's not true. Maybe there are people that do. I don't know.","I think so much of writing is an instinct, or a feel for a scene, or a feel for a character. You have to put into words the word 'tone,' which I think is thrown around a lot and can mean a hundred different things, but communicating that to other people is definitely a challenge.","What does being a woman today mean? Is there a right way of doing it? Is there a wrong way of doing it? Different kinds of women, female friendships: It's all pretty funny, and worth making fun of.","I started out wanting to be an actor and I like to give actors as much as possible. I love writing stuff where they can really lose control.","I love that song 'I Could Have Danced All Night' from 'My Fair Lady' so much. I love that song because watching it as a kid, it was such an unbridled expression of joy.","There are a lot of women screenwriters, but they are obviously outnumbered by men. And it still is a very much male-dominated industry.","Dysfunctional co-dependent relationships always appeal to me. I don't know exactly how it started. I start writing sketches of characters and little scene-lets, and then it builds.","But, yes, I learned everything working in theater. I learned the importance of community - I was constantly going to play readings, stand-up nights, improv. nights.","Please God, I hope my experience in downtown theater isn't over, because I'd love to keep making weird plays. I can't wait for Charles Isherwood to call my next play 'sit-com-y' and tell me to stick to writing television.","Why do British people make such good TV? It's so annoying. Stop it. Is it because they have free health care? Uggh.","The striking thing about 'New Girl' is that under all the comedy, there's something about the emotions and reactions that feels very real - much more real than other sitcoms. Like - maybe everybody is sort of laid bare in different ways.","Every show is unique, some shows have the master plan and have everything figured out and that's just the way they do things. It's like high school. Some people write their papers the second they get their assignments, and some people write it the day after it's due. I am the latter.","I just want to keep writing characters who are interesting and complicated people and interesting roles for women, in TV or film or in theater. I think that's like my 'Blues Brothers' mission.","It is hard to be an actor on a TV show, because you don't know what's coming and you sort of find out very last minute sort of what's happening.","I was really freaked out when I heard that Cookie Monster was going to be changed to Veggie Monster, but that turned out to be a lie.","I love 'Cheers.' I didn't watch it growing up, but I watched it getting ready to do the first season of 'New Girl.' It bowls me over every time I see it. The romance, the comedy, the performances - every bit of it is just so compelling.","The funniest things just come from honesty. We have a tendency to see female characters as representative of something larger than what they are, when male characters are just characters.","I had this temp receptionist job in New York, and I kind of hated it, and in the morning I would come out of the subway and just walk along the New York streets with all these people around me and kind of sing to myself. Like, 'She's gonna make it!'","If women ran Hollywood, 'The Hollywood Reporter' would have a 'Men in Entertainment' issue every year, and those jerks would have to write something.","People want to put women in one box, and I'm interested in how women can be everything at once."],"Elizabeth Missing Sewell":["Obedience is the primary object of all sound education.","A young man is stirred and stimulated by the consciousness of how much depends upon his own exertions: a young girl is oppressed by it."],"Elizabeth Mitchell":["You've gotta go for it, and go for it with gusto.","People feel good about doing things with you if you're enthusiastic.","I know it's so 'in' to be blase, but that's not going to get you anywhere.","Acting is so exciting to me. It's a thrill; otherwise I wouldn't do it. Not to be hokey, but I think life is definitely worth living, whether you're working or not. For an actor, the character is the thing... it doesn't matter what medium you're in. as long as you have something to do.","I normally eat everything under the sun, but once a year, for a whole month, I eat nothing but fruits, vegetables, nuts, and lean fish, and I feel great!","I was a complete, total nerd... I loved the idea that the underdog wins more often than not. And I don't know if that happens in life. But I want it to.","If you try to stay young forever, you don't really live.","I did theater for 15 years, and I spent a lot of time as an understudy.","You have what is right in front of you. You survive and you have your family. That's the whole world.","I've always been incredibly crazy about the fact that I'd have any fans at all. It says to me that the characters that I choose are interesting to people and that's thrilling to me. It really is.","I am very benign-looking. I'm somewhat like a golden retriever: It's not hard to look at me. I'm perfectly fine. It's not like things jut out and make you nervous. But the lovely thing about being so pale and having such pasty features is that I can look like pretty much anything, which is nice.","I'm not big on lying. I don't like that at all.","I will overlook bad behavior if I know that people's intentions are good. I have this belief that people really can do good things and that people want to be good."],"Elizabeth Montagu":["I endeavor to be wise when I cannot be merry, easy when I cannot be glad, content with what cannot be mended and patient when there be no redress.","To judge therefore of Shakespeare by Aristotle's rule is like trying a man by the Laws of one Country who acted under those of another.","Wit in women is apt to have bad consequences; like a sword without a scabbard, it wounds the wearer and provokes assailants.","I never invite idiots to my house.","She kindly laments that I am not of the party, and to be sure I honour great ladies, and I admire great wits, but I am of the same opinion in regard to assemblies that is held concerning oysters, that they are never good in a month that has not the letter R in it."],"Elizabeth Montgomery":["Television is such a mediocre medium.","I get letters from people saying one of the things they like best about what I've done since 'Bewitched' is that they never know what I'm going to do next.","I'd never thought much about a series, because I liked the idea of picking a script I liked with a character I thought I could sustain for an hour. In a series, you live with one character day in and day out - and you only hope it will be one that will not drive you crazy."],"Elizabeth Moon":["I love biomedical science, I love astronomy, and you can't really do much with those in a fantasy setting.","My first degree came years before my second. I had wanted to be a physicist, but I flunked calculus.","Having a mother who had been an aeronautical engineer convinced me that more things should be open to women.","You can also make explicit certain social problems which, again, would be prejudged or not encountered at all in real life, because people have set up defenses against it. Fantasy allows you to get past defenses.","Hard to be a physics major at Rice University if you have flunked calculus.","In a novel, I could submerge my ego in a character's and let his perceptions take over.","It's hard to hold the focus that strongly on a single character for that long.","There are relatively few science fiction or fantasy books with the main character being an old person.","Other people, including me, have written books with main characters who were old and rich. Or old and brilliant. Old sages, old wizards, old rich people.","Now my mother, interestingly enough, was not a feminist in her own mind.","When I was quite young, she was working in a hardware store, so I grew up knowing about hardware.","I had, of course, no model for that sort of woman being married, but I can make that up as I go along.","One of my degrees was a science degree in biology.","I actually feel that the different kinds of stories come out of different parts of my brain.","When a person responds emotionally to intellectual things, or emotionally only to traditional emotional things - I find that an interesting break between myself and some other writers and fans.","I can become very emotional about math, although I'm not that good at it.","My personal feeling about science fiction is that it's always in some way connected to the real world, to our everyday world.","It may be far in the future, but there's some kind of logical way to get from where we are to where the science fiction is.","But in fantasy, you can make a complete break, and you can put people in a situation where they are confronted with things that they would not confront in the real world.","So when I got out of the military, I went back to school in biology, and earned a biology degree at the University of Texas, and then did some graduate work in it.","I was writing fiction, but not finishing fiction.","I used to not back down from a challenge.","I regarded drugs as somewhat like rattlesnakes - it's possible to pick one up without getting bit, but why bother?","I've taught Sunday school, I've sung in the choir, I directed a choir.","I like the Beatles, of course, but that's when I grew up.","No, but a cello is the perfect string bass for an accordion. Works with it beautifully.","When I was starting out, I did not do short fiction well, because I kept wanting to write books."],"Elizabeth Olsen":["I get way too much happiness from good food.","I've only done one shoot where it's modeling clothes, not like me in my environment. And the stylist, literally, I had her stand behind the photographer and do poses.","I would love to date a chef. I'd probably get really fat, but I don't care.","I don't know about you, but my girlfriends have been my girlfriends forever, and they're my sisters and my family.","If you don't like something, talk about something else that's great and maybe someone else will discover it and think it's great too.","I believe that you are only in control of so much. So whatever you are not in control of you can't worry about.","What keeps you confident in a healthy way is knowing that everyone else around you is going to support you and teach you and you're going to learn from them. I just feel open to learning from people.","I never wanted anyone to think that I would use my family name to get me anywhere.","No, I wouldn't want the paparazzi ever following me in my life.","The tabloids create their own stories about people's lives that don't exist.","I just need to figure out how to grow without compromising.","I like men-inspired outfits.","I was embarrassed that I even wanted to become an actress because coming from L.A., with two older sisters in the business and a mom who had been a ballet dancer, it was such a cliche.","I had a great drama teacher in high school, and that's when I started to learn about the history of theater.","Movies are in a much longer production conversation before an actor is even involved. I always thought of actors as the last piece of the puzzle - so you're a tool.","Everyone is always surprised by how old I am. They think I'm older, but it's always been that way. I'm the youngest of four - maybe you grow up quicker because you just watch the big people.","But I have a list of books that I want to read before I die, and whenever I get time to read something that isn't a script, I'll read something from that.","You want everyone to succeed in your family.","When I was 14 or 15, I was a really good volleyball player, so I thought, 'Well, maybe I'll just get a scholarship to an Ivy League school through volleyball.' Then I quit when I decided to focus on theater.","I really actually enjoy auditioning.","And I've been taking acting classes since I was 7.","I auditioned equally for film and theater. The difference is that theater has seasons, while film, it's always happening.","And I think in theater, people don't really focus on the media unless there's a huge superstar doing a play or something.","I think every day you try to soak up as much as you can to learn and understand things better.","I find acting conservatories really important. I've gone to four different ones, and all of them provided totally different tools for me.","And at NYU, I went to the Atlantic Theater Company, and they have two main points. One of them is to always be active in something instead of just feeling it. And the other is figuring out your character.","I think a lot of films do themselves a disfavor by putting in way too much information, and everyone knows what's gonna happen next, and no one can actually discover things as they go.","Yes, I don't read books for entertainment.","I'm the curvy one of the family.","I've always loved being a student.","I've always had a complex about being taken seriously.","I also want to go to an Italian island and do cuisine properly with some famous Italian chef and, like, his mother.","Normally I don't feel like having a belly full of pasta.","I never understood why anyone would do magazines. Like, why would someone put their face out there so much? It's because those people reading magazines will go see the movie, so you do it.","My brother knows more about film sets than I do, because he works at New York Film Academy.","I always went to see independent films, they're the movies I'm usually most excited to see.","I'm terrified of improv. Improv in a show or in front of an audience sounds terrifying.","I'm the first one who sees every romantic comedy in theaters.","My friends and I started making films when I was still in kindergarten.","Well, I'd love to work with Kate Winslet - she's amazing.","It's interesting to watch myself with an audience; I'm trying hard to learn from it.","I've never read a young adult novel, though. I'm sure I would love it, but I've never read one.","'The Sun Also Rises' by Ernest Hemingway is my favorite book. You feel manly reading it.","I feel it is obvious when someone has thought too much about what they're wearing."],"Elizabeth Pena":["I believe the director is the one that sets the mood and if you have this hysterical director it's a domino effect. I would work for him forever, for nothing. Don't tell my agent that.","I figured, if I failed, I'd tried something that I hadn't tried before and if one movie was going to destroy my career than I didn't have much of a career to start with. I just went for it. God willing I wasn't over the top and didn't embarrass myself.","Sayles could pull a performance out of a dog. I'm serious. He was just amazing. The world could fall apart and he remained on neutral.","It's a clique and I think a clique exists in every business. There's a circle of people that are guaranteed to open a movie and we all know their names and whether they're right or wrong for the role.","Every time I work with a European director, I find they hire the person that captures the spirit of the role. Americans tend to hire the best face. The person that looks more like the role, whether they can perform the role or not is a bonus.","The work is getting the work.","I love acting. When I'm acting I feel like I'm on vacation. I'm just having a wonderful time. The nightmare is just getting the work to happen.","When I got Jacob's Latter, I was nervous because I felt I wasn't allowed to fail. I felt that they were waiting for one little failure and that would prove them right and I'd be, 'out of there.'","It was a lot of pressure, but I loved working with Tim and I loved working with Adrian.","When I'm not working, my family and I have a house in the San Juan Islands. We've been here since '94."],"Elizabeth Perkins":["I would kill the clone. That would be my first response.","If you're middle aged... where're you going to go to meet someone? You're not going to go to a bar, you're not going to go to a night club; and there are the museums.","I have two older sisters; I'm the youngest.","My sisters are very academically inclined so whenever they would fix me up, it would always be from someone in their world, people they would find attractive. When they came to the door in suits, it was over.","It doesn't happen very often that you get to work with some really good friends of yours and there's a common language between everyone, you don't have to explain what you're doing, you can just run with it. It makes it just so much easier and more relaxed.","It seems like all the good looking people have smaller dogs these days. Especially for the women, because they always come in with their little Chihuahuas and the guys come in with their Golden Retrievers.","My kids are old enough now that they can watch that, but I like to do the family movies.","My oldest step-son wants to direct or produce. As far as being an actor, I've already told them they have to wait until they're 18; I won't take them to auditions.","Right now, my daughter's just rolling her eyes at everything I do; I'm just an embarrassment."],"Elizabeth Peyton":["A painting of a person can be descriptive, but for me it's about all the things that make up a picture - the feelings, the brushstrokes - more than describing somebody. People latch on to the personalities when they talk about my work and forget the other parts.","I think little things are more powerful because they're more honest, so people feel them more strongly.","Romanticism is not just about being in a fixed state of endless beauty, because you can't live like that or live on that, that's what I've learnt.","I think everybody can be beautiful. Anybody can have beauty. It's about how you look at the world, in a way, and how you treat yourself.","The faces people make when they are photographed and the face they have when you draw them are very different.","I don't rise to the occasion unless I'm really moved.","There's something in music that fascinates me - how it communicates emotion so immediately. That's something I wanted in my paintings.","I lived in London for a time in the '90s and I love it here. You know, I just go and see shows and have great dinners and walk around.","You really need faith in yourself to make art and to stand up for what you believe in.","I think it is such an amazing moment when people realize what they are and what they can be, and they start putting themselves out into the world. I think you can see it in people when it's happening. They look different.","I start listening to something, or I'm seeing somebody a lot or seeing their art. And then I just really want to make a picture of them.","No one is famous when they wake up in the morning, so it's nice seeing people in moments when they're just being themselves.","To paint well, I need to be enraptured by my subjects.","In 19th-century France, artists were part of government. Artists are very sensitive to their time. They're very thoughtful people - it makes sense to hear what they have to say.","I love the idea that someone I like would have a piece of mine in their house and have a relationship with it.","If art is any good, it has so much of a longer trajectory than one night. Contemporary art is separate from art openings. In the end, it depends on the strength of ideas in each piece."],"Elizabeth Pisani":["I don't get how it's okay to keep someone alive once they're sick - but not okay to stop them getting sick. I just don't get that.","I think if we can prevent a fatal disease, we should."],"Elizabeth Price":["Anyone could be in the orchestra, or sports team, or arts club at my school. It was precisely the kind of inclusivity that now meets with a sort of scorn and derision as a prizes-for-all culture that generates only mediocrity. There's something so insulting about the idea that including lots of people means mediocrity.","If you look at my CV, just about everything I have done has come through a publicly funded institution; it is a career entirely built on that sort of support.","I work intentionally to try and make dense, complex things. We can move between genres and forms, from something that looks like a PowerPoint lecture to something that looks like an informercial to something that looks like a cinematic melodrama.","I have a pretty expanded view of what art is. I include pop music and even some sports.","For women who have children, the economic difficulty of sustaining a life as an artist maybe makes it impossible. There's no maternity leave, there's no pension.","Because it's difficult to have a career as an artist, and in every situation where it's difficult to have a career, it's even harder for women, for all the other reasons that it's harder in other fiercely contested fields."],"Elizabeth Reaser":["In my free time, I love to lay in bed.","It's funny to be playing a mom. I mean, I'm not a mom in real life. I don't even have a dog.","I was a total bad girl growing up.","I really wanted to do plays since I was a little girl. I wanted to go to Juilliard and to learn, but then I really fell in love with doing film and television along the way.","People who know me would say they get a kick out of the fact that I'm always playing nice people, not that I'm not a nice person, but it's not a defining element.","It's interesting to me that I get cast as mothers and really maternal, sweet, nice people... Maybe I have a vulnerability or something; maybe that's what it is.","I think part of the fun of being an actor is getting to work with different directors and seeing their take on it, what they're passionate about. They all have different ideas about your character.","My career's been a steady, interesting, weird, frustrating, fun journey at all different times.","I think Chris Weitz is an amazing director, and his sensibility - I wouldn't even know how to articulate it - it's just, he's a very sensitive, interesting guy.","Sometimes I think your face and your bearing and your energy have so much more to do with the jobs you get than the actual work and the time and the effort that you put in, or the talent even.","I'm often uncomfortable with girliness, to be honest.","I don't like to watch myself. For the most part, I find it weird. It depresses me; I'm very critical.","Mostly I work really unconsciously, and I think if the scenes are really well written, which they are, and if I just throw myself into it, I don't really think about it.","I've stayed away from Twitter for a long time because I sort of didn't trust myself with such an intimate but very public way of relating to the world, but I feel like I've studied it enough.","I think women who don't understand boundaries are fascinating.","I love 'True Blood!'","I get cast a lot of times in movies with nice people for some reason - because I have a nice face or something.","I love, love, love to rehearse, but when you're rehearsing and then you go do it at night, it's a very weird thing, because you're incorporating all these new things.","I'm not trying to take anything away from film acting, because it's also really hard, and I worship the people who are great at it. But to actually have to go out on stage night after night and do it with your audience right there is so wild and scary and exciting and fun and all the things that I remember loving about it.","I needed to do a play. I needed to learn how to act again, in a focused, all-encompassing way, and a really challenging play is a great way to do that.","I was 16. In the middle of the night, I took a taxi to the Detroit train station - or maybe it was the Pontiac train station? - and got on a train to Chicago, then transferred to a train to San Diego where my boyfriend was living at the time.","I love kids. My sister has four boys, and I'm obsessed with them.","I don't connect to a certain girliness or talking about girly things - I feel unauthentic and uncomfortable in that world - maybe I'm just more butch than I realize! I have, however, been fortunate to have a number of great girlfriends. You don't meet as many girls as you do guys in my line of work, so I do cherish my friendships.","I'm friends with Elizabeth Banks - she's a great actress but not actressy at all. She's very cool. I adore her.","My father raised me from the time I was 12 years old. And it would never occur to me that I wouldn't be strong - I wasn't raised like that.","I was really bad until I was 18.","Eventually, I realized that I would not have a life until I buckled down. Once I did, I auditioned for Juilliard - and that changed everything.","I wanted to do plays. But then I got out of school and started getting jobs in movies and TV. And I seemed more suited to that. I like the intimacy of working for the camera, the size of performance it requires. I love getting into tiny moments.","It is hard to date anywhere... I think you just get a little older and hopefully a clearer idea of who you - I don't know. It is hard.","I have dated an actor or two. I've tried not to, but then, I don't want to be racist against actors.","I pretty much adore all my exes. I try to stay friends with them if I can.","I think, psychics, there are some people that really are psychic, and it doesn't make sense, but why should it make sense?","To me, there's so much we don't understand about our world, and I think it's really fascinating to see these people come up with the stuff that they come up with.","The Cullens, they're an interesting group of vampires. They're all really good but kind of bad. I mean, they are still vampires.","I don't wear sweatpants out as much as I would like. I would prefer to be in sweatpants most of the time.","It's surprisingly hard to play a vampire and feel believable. I mean, you want to be able to at least believe yourself.","I did a film called 'Puccini for Beginners,' which was a romantic comedy, and I always wanted to do more, but I kept doing drama.","Maybe I don't see enough television, but it seems there aren't many shows that are romantic comedies that are an hour long where you're not solving a crime or being a doctor.","You really have to listen and be vulnerable and open to the other actors and the environment."],"Elizabeth Robinson Schwartz":["I can remember standing in the middle of the field after the race and seeing the American flag raised and hearing 'The Star Spangled Banner' and all the people singing it. Then I walked off the field and just kind of enjoyed the feeling.","I was running to catch a train when one of my teachers saw me. He thought I was fast, time me, and later gave me my first instructions in sprinting. I happened to be at the right place at the right time.","Everything about the Olympics was first class, and women were treated as athletes and equals."],"Elizabeth Rodriguez":["We all have them, those parts of us that are the greatest parts of us and the worst parts of us. Sometimes we're put in circumstances and bad choices are made.","I'm not an immigrant - I was born and raised in New York. My parents are Puerto Rican, and Puerto Rico is a part of the U.S., for the people that don't know. So my whole life, I've identified as an American. There are times when I've gone to Puerto Rico, and there, I'm seen as the American cousin.","I have a little bit of extra testosterone, and it's good to put it to work when I can.","Like anyone, you could love someone, and it doesn't mean that you're equipped or you were taught or have the patience or the love or the wherewithal to be a good parent. One has nothing to do with the other.","I have incredible friends. Life is good.","Parts of you die with every decision you have to make. It becomes about making decisions between bad decisions and worse decisions.","I'm sort of a straight shooter.","I think the things about being with someone and knowing someone so well is that the things you love about them, you always will. The things that drive you crazy will always drive you crazy about them.","As a human being, you can't not connect to the chaos that exists around the world on a day-to-day, or things that you've seen on the news just here domestically.","I don't watch the news because I wouldn't leave the house. I would not leave the house.","I grew up in a broken home, working class. My paternal grandmother raised me and my brother; my father was with us, and my mother lived in Jersey.","When you have a tough childhood, you either cry or make a joke.","I love being super-tough, but if I need to put on a dress and do my hair and makeup, I can do that, too.","I know that for me, whenever I'm in a situation where there's death or sickness, my personality is to come in and do whatever I can to ease anything I can, in terms of offering to take care of things. Cooking, organizing, things like that."],"Elizabeth Smart":["Vanity is a vital aid to nature: completely and absolutely necessary to life. It is one of nature's ways to bind you to the earth."],"Elizabeth Strout":["I've always been tremendously interested in criminal law. It goes to a deep interest I have in prisons and the criminal element, and what we do as a society with it. I've always been touched by the idea of criminality.","I got a gerontology certificate a million years ago along with my law degree, so I've been interested in older people for many years. Some people grow up with a lot of kids around, but I just grew up with a lot of old people.","I'm writing for my ideal reader, for somebody who's willing to take the time, who's willing to get lost in a new world, who's willing to do their part. But then I have to do my part and give them a sound and a voice that they believe in enough to keep going.","I love the comfort of daily life's routines: things like being able to read a paper on the subway. It's no accident that my favourite word is 'quotidian.'","I was a pretty terrible lawyer. A really, really terrible lawyer.","I do reread, kind of obsessively, partly for the surprise of how the same book reads at a different point in life, and partly to have the sense of returning to an old friend.","The fact of the matter is I always have a really high sense of responsibility to the reader, whether it's a few readers that I get or a lot of readers, which I was lucky enough to get with 'Olive.' I feel responsible to them, to deliver something as truthful and straight as I can.","In a way, I'm very interested in writing about Maine, because I think Maine represents its own kind of history. It's the oldest state, and it's the whitest state.","I do write by hand. I just think - I don't know, it's a physical thing for me. It's a bodily thing. It literally has to earn its way through my hand.","My first job was when I was about 12, cleaning houses in the afternoons for different elderly women in town. I hated it.","Without a doubt my mother was an inspiration for my writing. This is true in many ways, but mostly because she is a wonderful storyteller, without even knowing it.","I love theater. I love sitting in an audience and having the actors right there, playing out what it means to be a human being.","I don't especially like to travel, not the way many people do. I know many people that love to go to far-off and different places, and I've never been like that. I seem to get homesick as quickly as a child.","For years I did most of my reading on the F train between Brooklyn and Manhattan. I had long commutes, and I read tons of books on that train; I loved it.","I don't think there was a particular book that made me want to write. They all did. I always wanted to write.","Oh, I wish I organized my books. But I don't. I'm not an organized person. The best I can do is put the books I really like in one sort of general area, and poetry in another.","If you get divorced in New York, you go into therapy and will talk to anybody you meet on the sidewalk about it.","I don't want to live in Maine full time, but the physical beauty is very striking. It is the exact opposite of New York. When you walk through my small town to get a cup of coffee, you bump into five people you know.","Bullies are just frightened people.","My parents were very, very, very strict.","I don't know if I have a memory of not thinking I was a writer - it goes that far back. I went to law school because I didn't know how to earn a living otherwise. I tried to ignore the pull, but it wouldn't let me.","I grew up on a dirt road in Maine, and pretty much everybody on that dirt road was related to me, and they were old. And so grumpy.","I like people a lot, but I am not comfortable in literary New York situations. There is deep anxiety and tension around success here. I don't share problems I'm having about my work, and I think conversations around publishing are boring.","The purpose of fiction is not to make people seem nice. What makes anyone think people are nice? Look around you!","As a novelist, I like the contained drama and complexity of the courtroom, though I don't watch those shows on TV. I prefer the hospital shows because I wanted to be a doctor.","I'm so deeply interested in what it feels like to be other people that I get to operate under the illusion when I'm writing fiction that I'm not really revealing that much about myself. But, of course, I am, and I know that I am. And yet there's this sort of membrane that I get to work behind as I write my fiction, and I love it.","In the kind of New England I'm from, you are expected to stay and marry somebody from New England - well, Maine, actually - so I think it was seen as a betrayal when I left for New York, which has been my refuge.","I'm drawn to New England because that's where my roots are, and I miss it. I come from many generations of New Englanders, and so, in my writing, I've been drawn back there to the landscape and the light and the type of personality that's revealed.","I don't think there's anybody I write about who I don't care for deeply in some way, no matter what their behavior is.","Oh, I do a tremendous amount of rewriting. I just obsessively rewrite. Although sometimes there are sections, sometimes you're just lucky and a paragraph will just kind of come out. And that's great. But that's not ordinary in a day's work.","I don't ever really know where I get my characters from.","I love arranging the words and having them fall on the ear the right way, and you know you're not quite there, and you're redoing it and redoing it, and there's a wonderful thrill to it. But it is hard. It's a job of tremendous anxiety for me.","I don't think of myself as a fast reader. I just read a lot. When someone else might think, 'I might do the dishes,' I don't. But then the dishes multiply.","'Pnin' by Vladimir Nabokov, which is a literally small book, fit right in my common law book. I would sit in class and read it.","I sometimes miss the sense of excitement that I remember having when I was younger. I miss that sense of, 'Oh wow.' I think it's part of aging.","I think, really, that the only way a person can open their heart to someone who is so much another is really by knowing them... whether that's in a classroom, or a soccer team, or a food pantry, or any of those things. I mean, we're kind of more alike than we are different."],"Elizabeth Stuart Phelps":["Out of my discomforts, which were small enough, grew one thing for which I have all my life been grateful, the formation of fixed habits of work.","Happiness must be cultivated. It is like character. It is not a thing to be safely let alone for a moment, or it will run to weeds.","It is not the straining for great things that is most effective; it is the doing the little things, the common duties, a little better and better.","What an immense power over the life is the power of possessing distinct aims. The voice, the dress, the look, the very motion of a person, define and alter when he or she begins to live for a reason.","A great idea is usually original to more than one discoverer. Great ideas come when the world needs them. Great ideas surround the world's ignorance and press for admission.","It is impossible to forget the sense of dignity which marks the hour when one becomes a wage-earner... I felt that I had suddenly acquired value to myself, to my family, and to the world.","Surely it is one of the simplest laws of taste in dress, that it shall not attract undue attention from the wearer to the worn."],"Elizabeth Taylor":["I feel very adventurous. There are so many doors to be opened, and I'm not afraid to look behind them.","I fell off my pink cloud with a thud.","It is strange that the years teach us patience; that the shorter our time, the greater our capacity for waiting.","I haven't read any of the autobiographies about me.","You find out who your real friends are when you're involved in a scandal.","I'm a survivor - a living example of what people can go through and survive.","I've always admitted that I'm ruled by my passions.","Big girls need big diamonds.","The problem with people who have no vices is that generally you can be pretty sure they're going to have some pretty annoying virtues.","So much to do, so little done, such things to be.","I don't pretend to be an ordinary housewife.","Success is a great deodorant.","I am a very committed wife. And I should be committed too - for being married so many times.","I think I'm finally growing up - and about time.","People who know me well, call me Elizabeth. I dislike Liz.","When people say, 'She's got everything', I've got one answer - I haven't had tomorrow.","I suppose when they reach a certain age some men are afraid to grow up. It seems the older the men get, the younger their new wives get.","My mother says I didn't open my eyes for eight days after I was born, but when I did, the first thing I saw was an engagement ring. I was hooked.","I sweat real sweat and I shake real shakes.","I adore wearing gems, but not because they are mine. You can't possess radiance, you can only admire it.","Some of my best leading men have been dogs and horses.","If someone's dumb enough to offer me a million dollars to make a picture, I'm certainly not dumb enough to turn it down.","It's not the having, it's the getting.","I have a woman's body and a child's emotions.","I don't think President Bush is doing anything at all about Aids. In fact, I'm not sure he even knows how to spell Aids.","Everything makes me nervous - except making films.","I've only slept with men I've been married to. How many women can make that claim?","I've been through it all, baby, I'm mother courage.","I really don't remember much about Cleopatra. There were a lot of other things going on.","Marriage is a great institution."],"Elizabeth Thornton":["If we are honest with ourselves, we have to admit that sometimes our assumptions and preconceived notions are wrong, and therefore, our interpretation of events is incorrect. This causes us to overreact, to take things personally, or to judge people unfairly.","To be an objective leader means aligning your models with the needs of the organization. There is no question anymore that collaboration, seeking out diverse perspectives and developing new ways to look at challenges and opportunities, is a key leadership competency.","The key to creating the mental space before responding is mindfulness. Mindfulness is a way of being present: paying attention to and accepting what is happening in our lives. It helps us to be aware of and step away from our automatic and habitual reactions to our everyday experiences.","We are not a victim of our emotions or thoughts. We can understand our triggers and use them as tools to help us respond more objectively.","To be an effective leader and make sound decisions, you must be able to gather data by seeking out diverse perspectives and be willing to consider points of view other than your own.","Objective leaders identify their unproductive mental models and tweak them for greater effectiveness.","There are times when we are just not very kind to ourselves. The problem with our negative thoughts is that the latest science has revealed that thoughts are very powerful, even impacting us physically.","Because of the power of neuroplasticity, you can, in fact, reframe your world and rewire your brain so that you are more objective. You have the power to see things as they are so that you can respond thoughtfully, deliberately, and effectively to everything you experience.","New Year's Resolutions come and go. Some we keep, some we don't. In order to make lasting changes in our lives, we must first change our minds. We sometimes forget, and we often feel stuck, but we all have the power to do so.","One of the most powerful transformational catalysts is knowledge, new information, or logic that defies old mental models and ways of thinking.","Complete objectivity is not an option. We are all subjective about the way we respond to 'what is,' whether it's the people we encounter, the circumstances in our lives, or ourselves. What we can do is reduce our subjectivity - what I call 'I see, therefore it is.'","The key to transforming mental models is to interrupt the automatic responses that are driven by the old model and respond differently based on the new model. Each time you are able to do this, you are actually loosening the old circuit and creating new neural connections in your brain, often referred to as self-directed neuroplasticity.","When we are fully conscious and aware, we actually know when we are about to overreact. When we are mindful, we have the mental space and are aware of when our moods change. When we are mindful, we are aware of when our mental models are being challenged and when expectation does not meet with reality, which can trigger an emotional response.","When there is a problem, always identify and evaluate your underlying assumptions that may be contributing to the problem or preventing you from seeing the problem clearly.","Sometimes our childhood experiences are emotionally intense, which can create strong mental models. These experiences and our assumptions about them are then reinforced in our memory and can continue to drive our behavior as adults.","Most of us know when we are about to react emotionally. We can feel it. Often there is a brief warning before the amygdala hijack. For some of us, it is butterflies in the stomach; for some, it is an increased heart rate, and for others, it is a feeling of agitation.","To increase our objectivity, we must learn to switch off the mini-movies. Objectivity requires us to be mindful, present in the moment, and experiencing what is happening without judgment.","Our thoughts are certainly part of us; they come from us, but we are not our thoughts. Have you ever woken up in the morning and said to yourself, 'I am not going to think today; I am too tired'? No, of course not. Just as breathing happens and is constant, thoughts happen, and they are also constant.","It is important to remember that a thought is harmless unless we believe them and act on them. As the subject, since thoughts are an object of your awareness, you have the power to challenge every thought. You can decide if you want to make that thought real.","Our brains have the ability to reorganize themselves by forming new neural connections throughout our lives. This ability is called neuroplasticity.","The truth is many of us have been socialized to think that if we are not the very best, if we are not at the top 1 percent of whatever it is we do, then we are not good enough. To reinforce this already pervasive mental model, society has established a competitive hierarchy for just about everything.","Many high school students are under so much competitive pressure. They are sometimes taught that if they don't have a 4.0 GPA, score in the 99th percentile on admissions tests, and demonstrate leadership in sports and participate in clubs, they won't get into college anywhere. Even highly credentialed professionals get caught up in this.","We all have mental models: the lens through which we see the world that drive our responses to everything we experience. Being aware of your mental models is key to being objective.","We perceive through our senses a person, a situation or an event, and in an instant, we project our mental models - our fears, background and experiences - onto that perception. This often results in cognitive errors, which means we judge and respond incorrectly.","When we can see things as they are, without projecting our mental models and fears, we are being objective. When we can understand and consider another person's point of view, we are being objective."],"Elizabeth Vargas":["We're way overdue on a woman sitting in one of those Big Three chairs.","Six months ago, I traveled to India to see firsthand what the prime minister of that country calls a national shame. It is the systematic, widespread, shocking elimination of India's baby girls. Some 50,000 female fetuses are aborted every month in India.","It's estimated that one million girls in India 'disappear' every year.","I think there's nothing better in the world than a spirited discussion about the Bible and Jesus and God and the Catholic faith, or the Jewish faith, or the Muslim faith - any religion.","For now, for this year, I need to be a good mother.","I am not a pregnant working mother wronged.","I worked in three local news markets and in every single one of them, they said: 'You're a lousy anchor. We would love to renew your contract and have you be our lead reporter here, but we're not going to have you anchor.'","You know, guys, it is possible for two women to work together and get along.","I'm praying we don't go to war with Iraq. If we do, I may have to go back to work earlier."],"Elizabeth Warren":["A good education is a foundation for a better future.","People who graduate are more resilient financially, and they weather economic downturns better than people who don't graduate. And, throughout their lives, people who graduate are more likely to be economically secure, more likely to be healthy, and more likely to live longer. Face it: A college degree puts a lot in your corner.","What I've learned is that real change is very, very hard. But I've also learned that change is possible - if you fight for it.","I don't think anyone went the polls and said, 'I am casting my vote to make sure that Wall Street has better chances to make bigger profits off the backs of the American people.'","You can't predict it all. People will tell you to plan things out as best you can. They will tell you to focus. They will tell you to follow your dreams. They will all be right.","I'm willing to throw my body in front of the bus to stop bad ideas.","Americans are fighters. We're tough, resourceful and creative, and if we have the chance to fight on a level playing field, where everyone pays a fair share and everyone has a real shot, then no one - no one can stop us.","I grew up in the Methodist church and taught Sunday school, and one of my favorite passages of scripture is, 'in as much as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.' Matthew 25:40.","The word's out: I'm a woman, and I'm going to have trouble backing off on that. I am what I am. I'll go out and talk to people about what's happening to their families, and when I do that, I'm a mother. I'm a grandmother.","I never sought nor gained personal benefit in school or job applications based on my heritage.","Now look, you built a factory and it turned into something terrific or a great idea, God Bless, keep a big hunk of it. But part of the underlying social contract is you take a hunk of that and paid forward for the next kid who comes along.","When billionaire car dealers or manufacturers pay for ambassadorships, at least they pay with money earned by selling something of value.","Growing up, my mother and grandparents often talked about our family's Native American heritage. As a kid, I never thought to ask them for documentation - what kid would?","Cops on the beat can stop problems before the damage spreads.","I get heartfelt thanks from all kinds of people. Today I heard from a waitress in Georgia who has lost her job and is trying to figure out how her local bank can change the terms on her credit card, and I heard from a physicist at a major research university who wants to explain a better theory of financial stress tests.","We need a new model: If you can't explain it, you can't sell it.","I have voted against only one of President Obama's nominees: Michael Froman, a Citigroup alumnus who is currently storming the halls of Congress as U.S. Trade Representative pushing trade deals that threaten to undermine financial regulation, workers' rights, and environmental protections.","Because policymakers often rely on think tanks' research when crafting laws and regulations, it's critical to know whether these organizations are truly independent.","Unfair servicing practices can worsen a family's already difficult economic situation, and the injury echoes from the family to the community and ultimately throughout the economy.","I made it real clear to the business community - if your plan for innovation is to trick people, is to fool them, is not to tell them the truth about the price, then you're right: I'm going to be right in the way.","America had been a boom-and-bust economy going into the Great Depression - just over and over and over, fortunes were wiped out, ordinary families were crushed under it.","Credit cards are like snakes: Handle 'em long enough, and one will bite you.","Never be so faithful to your plan that you are unwilling to consider the unexpected. Never be so faithful to your plan that you are unwilling to entertain the improbable opportunity that comes looking for you.","'Middle class' used to be synonymous with secure, with steady, with boring, because middle-class people were people who were pretty much safe from the time they first started work on through retirement and until their deaths. No longer.","Marathon Day in Boston and all of Massachusetts, it's Patriot's Day, and it's a big celebration for us. It's a day when we're kind of the whole world's city there.","Others have said it before me. If you don't have a seat at the table, you're probably on the menu. And so it is important that we have women in the United States Senate - strong women, women who are there to help advance an agenda that is important to women.","A pension is nothing more than deferred compensation.","Everyone would like the world always to be in bubble times. But that doesn't happen.","Big corporations have money and power to make sure every rule breaks their way; people have voices and votes to push back.","How do you think we build a future? I think we build it by investing in our kids and investing in education.","And that's how we build the economy of the future. An economy with more jobs and less debt, we root it in fairness. We grow it with opportunity. And we build it together.","Bankruptcy is about financial death and financial rebirth. Bankruptcy is the great American story rewritten. We're a nation of debtors.","When I first started talking about running for office, a lot of people said to me, 'Don't let the consultants change you,' and I'd always assured them that I wouldn't allow it to happen. But like it or not, I had to change. Not because of a consultant, but because I started to understand the cost of a stupid mistake.","Regulators all meet with Goldman Sachs executives and employees day after day after day. They don't see the people who get tricked, the people who get cheated, the people who get fooled by the products that Goldman turns out.","My mother had taught me about the importance of finding a 'good provider,' so when my boyfriend proposed, I said 'yes' in a heartbeat. I was still just a kid, and I didn't know what was coming in life.","You have two pages, that's the whole credit card agreement. The terms are clear and flat and easy to see so anyone can read them. So you could lay four credit cards in front of you and say, 'Oh, that's the one that has the highest rate, that's the one that has the really scary provision that could hurt me.'","Like a lot of you, I grew up in a family on the ragged edges of the middle class. My daddy sold carpeting and ended up as a maintenance man. After he had a heart attack, my mom worked the phones at Sears so we could hang on to our house.","Who is Antonio Weiss? He's the head of global investment banking for the financial giant Lazard.","I want millionaires and billionaires and Big Oil companies to pay their fair share.","I got married at 19 and graduated from a commuter college in Texas that cost $50 a semester. The way I see it, I'm a janitor's daughter who became a public school teacher, a professor, and a United States Senator. America is truly a country of opportunity!","America's middle class is getting hammered, and Washington is rigged to work for the big guy.","I graduated law school nine months pregnant and didn't take a job.","If the notion on this is we're going to elect somebody to the United States Senate so they can be the 100th least senior person in there and be polite, and somewhere in their fourth or fifth year do some bipartisan bill that nobody cares about, don't vote for me.","In 1978, we adopted a new Bankruptcy Code in the United States, and a principal part of this was designed to adjust to the new corporation, to find ways to let a corporation that had gotten into financial trouble reorganize itself. A big part of the selling point on this bankruptcy law was, 'It will preserve jobs.'","We need to align the incentives so that colleges have an incentive to keep down their costs... to graduate students on time with degrees in areas where they're going to be able to get jobs and going to be able to pay back those loans.","You built a factory out there, good for you. But I want to be clear. You moved your goods to market on the roads that the rest of us paid for. You hired workers that the rest of us paid to educate. You were safe in your factory because of police forces and fire forces that the rest of us paid for.","I think a lot of Americans are not sure which side Washington is on: the side of banks or the side of the people.","Mitt Romney is the guy who said corporations are people. No, Governor Romney, corporations are not people.","I don't want happy-face conclusions. I want the truth.","I will work my heart out to earn the trust of the people of Massachusetts.","The over-representation of Wall Street banks in senior government positions sends a bad message. It tells people that one - and only one - point of view will dominate economic policymaking.","Families rely on financial services more than ever, but those who need them most - who struggle to make ends meet - too often must contend with sky-high interest rates and tricks and traps buried in the fine print of their loan products.","Some economists estimate that for every family that goes bankrupt, there are about 15 more who are in the same amount of financial trouble and would profit from bankruptcy but just haven't filed.","There are lots of families who - who make irresponsible purchases. There are also a lot of families who have debt on credit cards because they use those credit cards to pay for medical bills.","Raising the minimum wage means we have workers paying more in to support the Social Security system.","I'm not someone who thinks Republicans are always wrong and Democrats are always right.","You didn't have to worry that marauding bands would come and seize everything in your factory and hire someone to protect against this because of the work the rest of us did.","I do not understand how it is that financial institutions could think that they could take taxpayer money and then turn around and act like it's business as usual. I don't understand how they can't see that the world has changed in a fundamental way, that it is not business as usual when you take taxpayer dollars.","What we collectively decide about how to bail out our economy, how to pull our economy out of a ditch and what rules we put in place to make sure this problem does not happen again, will shape our country for the next 50 years. This is it.","Consumer banking - selling debt to middle class families - has been a gold mine.","Democrats fought to get health insurance for more Americans. Democrats fought for a strong consumer agency so big banks can't cheat people. We fought, we won, and we improved the lives of millions of people - thank you, President Obama!","I hear all this, you know, 'Well, this is class warfare, this is whatever.' No. There is nobody in this country who got rich on his own - nobody.","If there had been a Financial Product Safety Commission in place 10 years ago, the current financial crisis would have been averted.","Part of my job is to make sense of all that I hear, and to retell it in a forceful way so that the decision-makers at Treasury can hear it. At least that's how I see it.","It is critical that the American people, and not just their financial institutions, be represented at the negotiating table.","Me, I was waiting tables of 13 and married at 19. I graduated from public schools, and taught elementary school.","People feel like the system is rigged against them, and here is the painful part, they're right. The system is rigged.","President Obama believes in a level playing field.","President Obama believes in a country where we invest in education, in roads and bridges, in science, and in the future so we can create new opportunities so the next kid can make it big and the kid afer that and the kid after that, that's what President Obama believes.","Are you ready to fight for good jobs and and a solid level playing field? Are you ready to prove to another generation of Americans that we can build a better country and a newer world? Joe Biden is ready. Barack Obama is ready. I am ready. You're ready.","The core of my career is my teaching and my writing.","I had a baby and stayed home for a couple of years, and I was really casting about, thinking, 'What am I going to do?' My husband's view of it was, 'Stay home... We'll have more children; you'll love this.' And I was very restless about it.","We can't go out and tell ourselves we've done good if we haven't.","I know what I am in Washington to do: I'm here to fight for hardworking families.","I was in a high school where everybody was a click better off.","It doesn't make me happy to go back and talk about how great high school was.","I was a Republican because I thought that those were the people who best supported markets. I think that is not true anymore. I was a Republican at a time when I felt like there was a problem that the markets were under a lot more strain. It worried me whether or not the government played too activist a role.","I'm not going to talk about who I voted for.","We cannot run a democracy without a strong middle class.","There's been such a sense that there's one set of rules for trillion-dollar financial institutions and a different set for all the rest of us. It's so pervasive that it's not even hidden.","G.E. doesn't pay any taxes, and we are asking college kids to take on even more debt to get an education and asking seniors to get by on less. These aren't just economic questions. These are moral questions.","You have to remember: what are incomes to banks are outgoes to families.","If you don't talk about families, then it's easy to disembody subprime mortgages and asset securitization and unemployment rates without remembering that every one of those numbers is a million families.","I was 30 before I realized, you know, that I probably was an accident. These things just suddenly hit you one day.","Writing laws based on an abstract theory, rather than reality, is a dangerous undertaking.","I had to make a choice - recede into the academic world, or wade into politics.","All I can say is I was a lot more discreet as a candidate than I was in real life. Can I say that? Maybe it's indiscreet to talk about discretion.","The 21st Century Glass-Steagall Act will reestablish a wall between commercial and investment banking, make our financial system more stable and secure, and protect American families.","I learned early on what debt means, how vulnerable it makes people, what the security of owning a home means.","I have to prove myself to everybody.","People have hearts, they have kids, they get jobs, they get sick, they cry, they dance. They live, they love, and they die. And that matters.","We're Americans. We celebrate success. We just don't want the game to be rigged.","Republicans say they don't believe in government. Sure they do. They believe in government to help themselves and their powerful friends.","My brothers and I grew up on stories about our grandfather building one-room schoolhouses and about our grandparents' courtship and their early lives together in Indian Territory.","I'm really concerned that too-big-to-fail has become too-big-for-trial.","If large financial institutions can break the law and accumulate million in profits - and, if they get caught, settle by paying out of those profits - they do not have much incentive to follow the law.","We shouldn't be profiting from our students who are drowning in debt while giving a great deal to the banks. That's just wrong.","People with banking experience haven't all flocked to the biggest banks; community banks and regional banks, along with smaller trading houses and credit unions, have some very talented people.","Wall Street's outsized influence in our nation's capital is something I've talked about for a long time - long before I even thought about running for office. But where I see a problem - an infestation, really - a lot of others in Washington, both Democrats and Republicans, seem to see government working just fine.","Groupthink can become a serious issue - old ideas stay around after they're useful, and new ideas too often don't get a fair hearing.","Too often, people get jobs based on who they know - not what they know.","There is one thing Anthony Weiner and I agree on: there are a lot of smart, hard-working people in the financial industry.","Wall Street banks have the right to express their views to lawmakers and regulators through lobbying, but the law is clear: If they want to influence lawmakers, they must disclose their lobbying expenditures.","If the big banks expect to buy influence when they give money to favored think tanks, then the public has a right to know. If the big banks don't expect to buy influence and are merely making charitable contributions, then their shareholders have a right to know. Either way, there's no excuse for keeping these payments secret.","The poor pay more, and that's one of the reasons people get trapped at the bottom of the economic ladder.","With post offices and postal workers already on the ground, USPS could partner with banks to make a critical difference for millions of Americans who don't have basic banking services because there are almost no banks or bank branches in their neighborhoods.","The Postal Service is huge - employing more than a half million people - and its history is long and complicated.","We've seen filibusters to block judicial nominations, jobs bills, political transparency, ending Big Oil subsidies - you name it, there's been a filibuster.","We've seen filibusters of bills and nominations that ultimately passed with 90 or more votes. Why filibuster something that has that kind of support? Just to slow down the process and keep the Senate from working.","I learned something important in my race against Senator Brown: voters want political leaders who are willing to break the partisan gridlock. They want fewer closed-door roadblocks and more public votes on legislation that could improve their lives.","Markets work when people can evaluate the prices and risks of different products, then pick the ones that work best for them. But when the terms of the deal are hidden, competition doesn't work. And customers aren't the only ones who are hurt.","The broken consumer credit market had to be repaired by making sure that consumers had the right information and could use it effectively. That meant consolidating the bloated patchwork of ineffective agencies and regulations so that a single agency could act as a voice for consumers.","We need to hold Wall Street accountable for issuing the kinds of deceptive loans that nearly brought our economy to its knees in 2008.","When she was 16, my grandmother, Hannie Reed, drove a wagon in the Oklahoma land rush.","Bankruptcy exposes the economic vulnerability and insecurity of middle class women.","The women who file for bankruptcy played by all the rules, but they are still in economic freefall.","For many women, the on-time payments of domestic support obligations are essential to economic survival.","Most women file for bankruptcy in the aftermath of a serious medical problem, a job loss, or a family break up. It is hard to protect against those.","Pundits talk about 'populist rage' as a way to trivialize the anger and fear coursing through the middle class.","Going to college and finding a good job no longer guarantee economic safety.","With the right sources of funding and some smart, strategic thinking about how to force non-banks to follow the same rules as other lenders, the entire landscape of consumer lending would change.","If your plan is to put a product out there that people can see and understand, then by golly, we're going to get along just fine.","Credit card agreements run as long as 30 pages, and it's 30 pages of largely incomprehensible text.","Consumers get used to reading and understanding their credit card contracts, their mortgages, their check overdraft agreements, those are good things. That puts power back in the hands of consumers.","When people feel like, 'Lenders weren't fair with me; I don't have any responsibility to be fair with them.' If we go far enough down that line, much of the fabric of our economy starts to unravel.","Even families with health insurance are quite vulnerable to a severe economic reversal if someone gets sick.","I pay for homeowner's insurance, I pay for car insurance, I pay for health insurance.","I'm not a Washington person.","It is not good not to have health insurance; that leaves the family very vulnerable.","I'll work with anyone - and I really do mean that - Democrat, Republican, independent, Libertarian, contrarian, vegetarian.","There are very few people at the decision-making table to argue for minimum-wage workers. Very few people.","I don't want to go to Washington to be a co-sponsor of some bland little bill nobody cares about. I don't want to go to Washington to get my name on something that makes small change at the margin.","I'm not running for president.","Does anyone believe that Goldman Sachs is gonna give up a deal that would yield millions of dollars because someone fussed at them behind closed doors?","There's a lot of talk coming from Citigroup about how Dodd-Frank isn't perfect. Let me say this to anyone who is listening at Citi: I agree with you. Dodd-Frank isn't perfect. It should have broken you into pieces.","Citigroup has a lot of money, it spends a lot of money, and it uses that money to grow and consolidate power. And it pays off.","I grew up in a family that nearly lost everything, but I ended up in the United States Senate because I grew up in an America that invested in kids like me and built a real future for us.","Thomas Piketty assembles the facts to prove a central point about trickle-down economics: Doesn't work. Never did. He has cold, hard data showing how the rich keep getting richer and how the playing field is rigged against working families.","We should stop having a conversation about cutting Social Security a little bit or a lot.","It is easy when you are successful to think that you did it all by yourself and to forget that you didn't. You got here because a lot of things broke your way. You were lucky enough to be born into a family that could afford to take care of you well.","I think I grew up with a profound sense of watching people who were good people, who were smart people, who were hardworking people - God, nobody on this Earth worked harder than my mom and dad - and they had very little.","Truly successful lives are about family.","I loved teaching, but every day that I went to work, I carried the worry that I was hurting my kids because I wasn't at home with them.","Banks were once places to hold money and were very careful in lending to finance families as they built a future - bought homes, bought cars, took out student loans.","No matter how good a deal sounds, if your name goes on the bottom line, you need to understand it and be sure you'll be able to pay. You are responsible for yourself forever. Forever.","Rising student-loan debt is an economic emergency.","In America today, a young person needs more education after high school just to have a chance to make it in the middle class. Not a guarantee, just a chance to make it.","Homeowners refinance their loans when interest rates go down. Businesses refinance their loans.","If President Barack Obama had not been in the White House, we would not have the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau today.","Early 2000s, we get Enron, which tells us the books are dirty. And what is our repeated response? We just keep pulling the threads out of the regulatory fabric.","It worries me about what happens if people in government are looking for that next job: 'Yeah I'm working now, not as much money as I could be making, but when I leave here, that's where I'm headed.' That ultimately infects whatever it is that they're doing.","We all understand that we are living longer, and we are more likely to spend more years as frail, elderly people who can't work. We also recognize that the wonderful advances in medicine also come with wonderful price tags. Those are things you can't budget around.","Other countries around the world make employees and retirees first in the priority. For example, in Mexico, the bankruptcy laws say if a company wants to go bankrupt... obligations to employees and retirees will have a first priority. That has an effect on every negotiation that takes place with every company in Mexico.","Every time the U.S. government makes a low-cost loan to someone, it's investing in them.","If Federal Reserve loans are subsidies, it doesn't show up in the federal budget.","You can put handcuffs on people who push the envelope. When they break the law, they deserve to have handcuffs.","I held my father's hand while he died of cancer, and it's really painful when you do something like that up close and personal. My mother was already gone, and I was very, very close to my father.","I think Hillary Clinton is terrific.","In the 1960s, a minimum wage job would keep a family of three afloat.","Some of these biggest financial institutions are out there trading in commodities. They're buying oil tankers. This is not a financial system that has calmed down and is there to serve the American people.","If nobody can sell mortgage-backed securities based on trillions of dollars of unpayable instruments, there's a lot less risk in the overall system.","When giant companies wanted more tax loopholes, Washington got it done. When huge energy companies wanted to tear up our environment, Washington got it done. When enormous Wall Street banks wanted new regulatory loopholes, Washington got it done. No gridlock there!","If you believe that America must work for all of us, not just the rich and powerful, if you believe we must reject the politics of fear and division, if you believe we are stronger together, then let's work our hearts out to make Hillary Clinton the next President of the United States!"],"Elizabeth Wilson":["In the 1940s, I was doing something called the Equity Library Theater in New York, when a movie company came to see the play I was in and offered me a contract. But the deal was, my nose was too big and they wanted me to have surgery. My jaw was crooked, and I'd have to have that fixed, too. And they didn't like my name; it was too common.","I had no desire to be a star. I wanted to be a character actress and be able to do all kinds of parts and work on a lot of things. That was my unconscious choice. I wanted to be an undercover actress.","I didn't want to give up my career. That's what kept me alive, kept me going. I couldn't stop - didn't want to stop - being all these different characters.","I had no desire to be a star and a star's responsibility.","When I was about 8, I used to go into one of the rooms in the mansion, and I would open a magazine like the 'Ladies Home Journal,' and I would see these characters on the pages and then become them, talking back and forth.","It's one thing to be talented, but the other thing is connections - with agents, with people; that's what makes a difference, and from the beginning, I've had wonderful representation.","I always felt the play came first. If it didn't touch me, I'd say forget the part."],"Elizabeth Wurtzel":["That's the thing about depression: A human being can survive almost anything, as long as she sees the end in sight. But depression is so insidious, and it compounds daily, that it's impossible to ever see the end. The fog is like a cage without a key.","Insanity is knowing that what you're doing is completely idiotic, but still, somehow, you just can't stop it.","I was meant to date the captain of the football team, I was going to be on a romantic excursion every Saturday night, I was destined to be collecting corsages from every boy in town before prom, accepting such floral offerings like competing sacrifices to a Delphic goddess.","I start to feel like I can't maintain the facade any longer, that I may just start to show through. And I wish I knew what was wrong. Maybe something about how stupid my whole life is.","I did not have a mobile phone in 1993. No one did, except the occasional banker or Hollywood star seeming smart, or the main character in 'American Psycho.' In 1993, every day was 'let's get lost.' I could walk Greenwich Village for hours and not be found.","I start to think there really is no cure for depression, that happiness is an ongoing battle, and I wonder if it isn't one I'll have to fight for as long as I live. I wonder if it's worth it.","Sometimes I think that I was forced to withdraw into depression because it was the only rightful protest I could throw in the face of a world that said it was alright for people to come and go as they please, that there were simply no real obligations left.","In a strange way, I had fallen in love with my depression.","I've calmed down. Looking back, I was engaged more in dramas than I was in relationships. I've spent a lot of my life being in it for the plot, and I don't do that anymore. I'm satisfied. I'm not competing with myself. I accomplished things I wanted to do, so everything I do now is because I want to, not because I'm trying to prove something.","I thought depression was the part of my character that made me worthwhile. I thought so little of myself, felt that I had such scant offerings to give to the world, that the one thing that justified my existence at all was my agony.","I wish I were shyly, quietly intriguing, like Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy, like someone French and fashionable who knows how to twirl her ladylike locks just so and walk adroitly on kitten heels, who is all gesture and whisper - but I am unfortunately forward and forthright: When I am interested in a man, he absolutely knows it.","I don't want any more vicissitudes, I don't want any more of this try, try again stuff. I just want out. I've had it. I am so tired. I am twenty and I am already exhausted.","It's like Samson and Delilah: watch your back, because trouble could be the person you're sleeping with.","There are some remarks that are so stupid that to be even vaguely aware of them is the intellectual equivalent of living next door to Chernobyl.","Some people just seem like they are up to no good. Like, in high school, I was a good student and got straight As. It was very strict, and you couldn't do well there unless you studied very hard, but every time there was any trouble, I was the first person they would be talking to.","I'm a huge Springsteen fan, and yet if either he or Bob Dylan had to be erased from the world's hard drive, I would save Bob Dylan's work for sure - he's the greater talent, and by leaps and bounds and skyscrapers and rocket blasts. But Bob Dylan is an alien to his public.","If you want to see that human story unfold, if you want to understand that only the unexpected life is worth a damn, spend some time with 46 years of Lou Reed's work: music that leaped and then looked. Safety is for the godless and the faithless.","Judaism will be enmeshed in pride and shame for as long as it endures. But to endure as a country, Israel must shun both these tendencies.","The men have piled up in my past, have fallen trenchantly through my life, like an avalanche that doesn't mean to kill but is going to bury me alive just the same.","I am baffled by men. When they want me, I don't want them; when I want them, they don't want me.","Why does the rest of the world put up with the hypocrisy, the need to put a happy face on sorrow, the need to keep on keeping on?... I don't know the answer, I know only that I can't.","Sometimes I wish that there were a way to let people know that just because I live in a world without rules, and in a life that is lawless, doesn't mean that it doesn't hurt so bad the morning after.","I always carry lots of stuff with me wherever I roam, always weighted down with books, with cassettes, with pens and paper, just in case I get the urge to sit down somewhere, and oh, I don't know, read something or write my masterpiece.","Everything's plastic, we're all gonna die.","All I do is go to the movies.","In life, single women are the most vulnerable adults. In movies, they are given imaginary power.","Am I worried people will say I'm repeating myself? Sure. One thought I had was to publish it as a novel but eventually I just decided to do what I wanted to do.","My life's actually been quite dull; it's not all that glamorous.","Like, in high school, I was a good student and got straight As. It was very strict and you couldn't do well there unless you studied very hard, but every time there was any trouble, I was the first person they would be talking to.","It was just very interesting to me that certain types of women inspire people's imagination, and all of them were very difficult women.","I'll see Naomi Wolf on television periodically, I have nothing against her and what she says, but I'll feel that she's a politician, like she's got an agenda to get across and that she doesn't always say what's really true or exactly what she feels.","Feminism is a good venue for getting yourself across as much as for getting your point across.","I admire Bruce Springsteen because he's a heroic person who has lots of integrity and has this incredible body of work that is so vital.","I'd really like to write a book about Timothy McVeigh, but it would only work if he cooperated.","You don't even have to hate to have a perfectly miserable time.","My imagination, my ability to understand the way love and people grow over time, how passion can surprise and renew, utterly failed me.","Age is a terrible avenger. The lessons of life give you so much to work with, but by the time you've got all this great wisdom, you don't get to be young anymore.","As it is my good fortune to be American, I live in the only country that as a matter of policy is pro-Israel regardless of party allegiance; Democrats and Republicans equally unite behind the blue-and-white.","Because trying to see all sides, such an instinct is particularly Jewish.","Israel fights back, which is very much at odds with the Jewish instinct to discuss and deconstruct everything until action itself seems senseless.","Yes, the United States is still the great meritocracy it's always been; but now, if you aren't brilliant or beautiful or both, there isn't much to do, because they can do it cheaper in Shanghai or Mumbai.","The American Dream, coupled with government subsidies of utilities and cheap consumer goods courtesy of slave labour somewhere else, has kept the poor huddled masses from rising up.","People who think that Sylvia Plath was a poor, sensitive poet are not getting that she had great amounts of ambition and anger that moved her along, or she wouldn't have been able to fight against that depression to produce such an incredible body of work by the age of thirty.","I always knew I was a writer. And I always thought to myself, 'Well, why not me?' Someone has to be on the best-seller list, 'Why not me?' Someone has to write for the 'New Yorker,' 'Why not me?' And I didn't really get much positive reinforcement as a kid, so I thought, 'Well let me show you what I can do.'","Everything good takes a great amount of effort. Like, things went wrong with 'Prozac Nation' so much, and it went through so many rejections and incarnations, but I felt so much that it needed to exist. But if I hadn't been so persistent and insistent, it wouldn't have happened.","I am motivated to write because it is what I am meant to do. It is not a choice - it is what I am. I did not choose writing - it chose me. And I believe it is necessarily that way. Anyone doing this for some other reason should not be.","I made 'Prozac Nation' necessary reading because I write necessarily. I tell my story because it is about everyone else: in 1993, people took pills to relieve the pain just like they do now, but it scared them; it doesn't any more, because talk is not cheap at all - it is tender.","I am not a nostalgic person.","I believe women who are supported by men are prostitutes; that is that, and I am heartbroken to live through a time where Wall Street money means these women are not treated with due disdain.","I am fortunate to have been well paid for an almost pathological honesty.","I don't know what to do if I am not inspiring some sort of false fascination.","I am a hopeless, shameless flirt.","The truth is that I'd always wanted to go to law school.","I had a really hard time after 9/11. I was basically living across the street from the World Trade Center, and a big chunk of debris fell on top of my building, and the roof caved in. I thought I was going to die. Really. I'd never thought that before, but on that day I sat there and thought 'I cannot believe it's going to end this way.'","Like everyone, I was a huge fan of David Boies, and from what I knew about him, I thought he might 'get' me. So I sent him an email. I said I want to practice law but that I didn't want to stop writing and I asked if there was any way I could practice law for him.","I used to feel that I spent too much of my time in my pajamas doing nothing, and I'd think 'in the time that I don't spend writing, I could raise a family of five.' In a lot of ways, being a writer is lonely and alienating.","Bruce Springsteen really got any creative person's dream career, and his good-heartedness and good-spiritedness are part of it: both because it made the people behind the scenes want to do their jobs that much better, but it also means that he connects with an audience in a way that holds them close.","By never marrying, I ended up never divorcing, but I also failed to accumulate that brocade of civility and padlock of security - kids you do or don't want, Tiffany silver you never use - that makes life complete.","Convention serves a purpose: It gives life meaning, and without it, one is in a constant existential crisis. If you don't have the imposition of family to remind you of what is at stake, something else will.","Women who have it all should try having nothing: I have no husband, no children, no real estate, no stocks, no bonds, no investments, no 401(k), no CDs, no IRAs, no emergency fund - I don't even have a savings account. It's not that I have not planned for the future; I have not planned for the present.","I have had the same friends since college, although as time has gone on, the daily nature of those relationships has changed, such that it is not daily at all."],"Elize Du Toit":["I'm not sure if I'll become Dr. Du Toit. I'm at the early stages of a long journey.","I see myself on the cover of a magazine and I don't think that it looks like me at all. My first-ever photo shoot was for the cover of a lads' magazine.","I'm just not very good at glamour... It doesn't come easily to me.","With acting, you might have a month of very intense work, but you've got a lot of downtime as well."],"Ella Baker":["Give light and people will find the way.","Strong people don't need strong leaders.","One of the things that has to be faced is the process of waiting to change the system, how much we have got to do to find out who we are, where we have come from and where we are going."],"Ella Eyre":["I've always had loads of teddy bears.","I learned a lot from Rudimental's live set. It's all about good feelings, good vibes and a good time, and that's what I want from my shows. I like big, bolshy performances, like Beyonce. I can't dance like her, though.","I love fierce performers.","I'd never been on tour until I met the Rudimental boys. Never done a live show in front of an audience.","My mum is very driven and has always kept me busy... She used to say to me, 'Nobody likes a teenager. So use your teenage years to work. Then enjoy your life when you're slightly older.'","I wake up every morning, and life is different. I've got a gig or a shoot. Flying here, flying there. Meeting wicked people. Going to amazing places. I'm relishing it.","I find my vocabulary is quite a lot better when I'm hungover. I feel like I unlock a key of words that I don't usually use in day-to-day life.","I'm actually quite good at being friends with my exes. I'm friends with almost everyone. In fact, everyone! So I let them burn to a certain degree, and then I put out the fire for a while.","I think for us up-and-coming artists, once you're out there, once you've put stuff up, once people know who you are, once you discover who you are, we're all in the same boat: it's down to whether people appreciate the music or not.","People are always looking for something new and something to latch on to and to back something from an early stage.","My background was always more soulful pop. I was named after Ella Fitzgerald, and when I was a kid, I was listening to Lauryn Hill, Etta James, Joss Stone. For me, it was always about the voice.","There's a lot less time in the day when you're in a relationship.","My mum's a bouncy, energetic, driven, crazy woman, and my dad's very relaxed, doesn't say much. I have the best of both worlds in my personality.","It's a small world. No matter what the circumstances, be nice to everyone, as you never know who you're going to see again.","I found out that I'd broken up with someone when I wasn't even aware I was going out with them!","On a normal day, I crawl out of bed before 8 A.M., have a protein shake, chuck my gym kit on, and go for a class or personal-training session. When I'm back, I'll have poached eggs with salmon or spinach for breakfast before my stylists arrive to do my hair - which takes ages. I then go wherever I am needed.","I was a competitive swimmer as a teenager, only stopping when I got persistent ear infections. Every day was a 6 A.M. start to swim before lessons, then choir or dance classes after.","I went to boarding school in Somerset and loved it so much that my teachers had to make me phone home when I first got there. Whenever I spoke to my mum, at the end of the call I would say, 'Love you, Mum', and she would say, 'Love you the most.'","My mum told me that grown-ups don't like teenagers, which is the last thing you want to hear when you are one yourself!","I love sushi. Once on Valentine's Day, someone I was dating rocked up at the airport to pick me up with a bag of salmon because I love it so much.","I take up my make-up with Garnier's Micellar and then exfoliate with a Kiehl's exfoliating cream.","I always have Giorgio Armani's Luminous Silk Foundation, Bobbi Brown's Jenna lipstick, and my Estee Lauder Double Wear Concealer.","My hairstylist uses the Bumble & Bumble hairspray, which is the best smelling hairspray there is!","I don't wash my hair very often. Once a week if I can. Because the more you wash it, you end up stripping out the natural oils. What I like to do is just rinse out the products that I've used during the week and then put leave-in conditioner in and let it dry naturally.","I like Aveda shampoo. I've used it since I was a swimmer.","Always keep wiping your face with towels when you work out because I find that the more I exercise, that's when I have my breakouts. You've got to keep the sweat off because the pores are open when you're hot and can get clogged.","It's so nice to be inspired by so many females - particularly the girls around me like Jess Glynne, Becky Hill, Sinead Harnett, Foxes - we all have similarities, but we're all very different, and I think it's nice that people are respecting that and noticing and enjoying us all equally.","I don't see life without a musical career. I really enjoy doing what I do.","I use writing as a counselling session - recently I've written a song for Paloma Faith, so after being a singer, I'm happy to keep writing for other people."],"Ella Fitzgerald":["The only thing better than singing is more singing.","Just don't give up trying to do what you really want to do. Where there is love and inspiration, I don't think you can go wrong.","I'm very shy, and I shy away from people. But the moment I hit the stage, it's a different feeling I get nerve from somewhere; maybe it's because it's something I love to do.","It isn't where you came from, its where you're going that counts.","I stole everything I ever heard, but mostly I stole from the horns.","Did I do all right?"],"Ella Henderson":["I love snow; I love building snowman. The only thing I don't like is the cold - so if we could have a hot Christmas, that would be amazing.","I like to say I believe in ghosts so I don't get haunted by one.","I just love mermaids. I was a mermaid in my past life. I just feel it when I go in the sea. I just feel a connection there between me, and the water, and the fish - they speak to me - and the shells - they ring out to me.","Dressing up and doing photo shoots was a side of the industry I really didn't think I would like. But now I've got a glam squad; I love trying on new outfits and experimenting with different looks.","A fan sent me a pair of fluffy winter socks, and I was like, 'Oh, that's cool. I'll wear them to bed. It's cold; it's winter.' But they were worn. They were black underneath, and they stunk, and I hate feet. She was like, 'I'm giving you my favorite pair.'","If something makes me happy, I go with it. It's as simple as that.","It's amazing when I do a gig how many people of different ages come up to me afterwards and chat to me about songs. The emotions I feel are what any person can relate to. Sometimes I'm just a narrator.","I love hiking to the top of mountains in L.A. and seeing incredible landscapes. It really inspires me.","If I feel like I've completely drained every ounce of energy out of me for this song, and I can't go any further with it, then I stop, even if the song is unfinished. Most of the time, when it's finished, it's because I've used every ounce of me to write it.","My grandfather was a massive influence in my music. Growing up, he would play a lot of old-school records to me. A lot of jazz and swing music, actually, growing up.","As long as it's making you happy and you're enjoying it, then you should never stop writing music. Whether it's going to take you somewhere, viewed by other people, or it's literally you in a bedroom at home, it should be something that you do for yourself.","I think I would fan over Beyonce or Adele. Those are my two girl idols, definitely.","I'm not a fussy eater, but when I'm travelling, I try to stick to the same regime and just have my chicken and my mash and broccoli. Otherwise, you start eating all these funny delicacies, and it makes your tummy turn upside down.","I never thought I'd go on a show like 'The X Factor,' simply because I didn't have enough confidence to do something like standing on a stage to have opinions thrown at me.","At 16, I would wear clothes that hid my body; now I've found clothes that fit me rather than cover me. I'm not skinny, but I'm healthy, and you have to embrace what you've been given.","When I am having my picture taken, I channel Beyonce. In the studio, my inspiration is Adele.","I knew from the start that I wanted my life to be about music. I taught myself the notes of the piano aged three, and then I spent the next few years deconstructing chords to figure out how to play them. At 11, I researched online the sort of music school I wanted to attend, printed out the details, and handed them to my parents.","I always say that when it comes to picking a single, firstly you have to go with what feels right and what your gut tells you.","I have never been in a serious relationship and never had a break-up, so I can't tug on my heartstrings that way. But whenever I experience a strong emotion in life, I definitely have to throw myself into my songwriting. It is very therapeutic.","I look up to Marilyn Monroe and Audrey Hepburn and old styles. You will never see me in a crop top and hot pants - I'm more into dresses.","As long as I give the best performance I can give, I know I can't do any more.","There's always been a piano around the house, and I've grown up around it. It's a massive part of my life and always has been.","I don't see myself as a pop star, just a singer.","For me writing is that place where I can escape; it's where I let my thoughts run wild.","I often do crazy siren noises, or, like, a high-pitched dolphin, just to make sure that all my range is there. I make random noise and blurt out random sounds, to make sure I get rid of any bad nerves. I want to make sure to feel as confident as possible.","It sounds a bit sad, but my new hobby is knitting. I love it. I find it really relaxing.","My plan was always to leave school and live in a flat with some friends, have a 9 to 5 job, and try to get as many gigs as I could. I wanted to keep writing and then eventually, in my twenties, head to a record label and hope they'd sit down and listen to my book of songs, sign me as a songwriter and maybe an artist in development.","Growing up, I listened and was influenced by a lot of those around me. I have a big family, and my dad listened to '80s music, my mom listened to Motown, my brother listened to reggae, and my granddad was the one that got me into jazz and swing music.","When I heard 'Back to Black' from Amy Winehouse, I was, like, 'Wow.' To hear such a soulful voice that feels like it's from a different era, I mean, it felt so fresh and unique, and that was something that opened my eyes and made me believe that it's not always about churning out the same thing in this industry."],"Ella Maillart":["The sooner we learn to be jointly responsible, the easier the sailing will be.","Certain travellers give the impression that they keep moving because only then do they feel fully alive.","You do not travel if you are afraid of the unknown, you travel for the unknown, that reveals you with yourself.","I had to live in the desert before I could understand the full value of grass in a green ditch.","The wideness of the horizon has to be inside us, cannot be anywhere but inside us, otherwise what we speak about is geographic distances.","Travel can also be the spirit of adventure somewhat tamed, for those who desire to do something they are a bit afraid of.","One of the main points about travelling is to develop in us a feeling of solidarity, of that oneness without which no better world is possible.","We must develop a deeper interest and greater understanding of the people we meet here or abroad. Like us, they are passengers on board that mysterious ship called life.","One travels to escape from it all, but that is the great illusion: It cannot be done, since one travels with one's mind.","When the heart speaks, its language is the same under all latitudes.","One travels to run away from routine, that dreadful routine that kills all imagination and all our capacity for enthusiasm.","Others are keen to see if natives other than us live better than we do, without heat in pipes, ice in boxes, sunshine in bulbs, music on disks, or images gliding over a pale screen.","From the beginning, I wanted to live my own life, and patiently I shored up that desire against wind and tide.","There is only one valid species of voyage, which is walk towards the men.","Every time I took a long leave from home, I felt as if I were going to conquer the world. Or rather, take possession of what is my birthright, my inheritance.","Humanity is made up of an infinity of different individuals. Each of us travels for motives exclusively his own.","I am sure that instinctively we wish to be everything, to possess it - why cut the rose or marry the man, otherwise?","I can see now that a concept or even a feeling makes no sense unless out of our substance we spin around it a web of references, of relationships, of values.","I did not want to be depressed by the gap existing between my weakness and my ambition.","I gained direct knowledge of the life of the poor in big towns: I have lived the narrowing mechanism of its conditioning and feared it.","I refuse to imprison our acts in the rigid mould of sentences.","I wanted to learn a few foreign languages, and therefore I had to go abroad.","It is always our own self that we find at the end of the journey. The sooner we face that self, the better.","Not only does travel give us a new system of reckoning, it also brings to the fore unknown aspects of our own self. Our consciousness being broadened and enriched, we shall judge ourselves more correctly.","One travels so as to learn once more how to marvel at life in the way a child does. And blessed be the poet, the artist who knows how to keep alive his sense of wonder.","Only when one is able to grasp wideness can one possess it.","Shall we ever see the 10 million things of the universe simultaneously in order to be the all? I am convinced that to live is to travel towards the world's end.","That idea of escapism... these words could sum up my life.","The benefits of the accomplished journey cannot be weighed in terms of perfect moments, but in terms of how this journey affects and changes our character.","The state of minds vary according to the angle under which one examines them.","The true traveller is the one urged to move about for physical, aesthetic, intellectual as well as spiritual reasons.","The usual channels of university studies or secretarial work did not appeal to me. I cherished difficult dreams through confidence in myself.","Those who appreciate the ways of simple tribes, where every activity is direct and immediately understandable, are able to live among them.","We want to feel that this earth is all ours, like our parents' house when we were children.","When I crossed Asia with my friend Peter Fleming, we spoke to no one but each other during many months, and we covered exactly the same ground. Nevertheless my journey differed completely from his.","When I look at something, it is certain that for an instant I am one with what I see.","Words are impotent to describe certain emotions.","You can feel as brave as Columbus starting for the unknown the first time you enter a Chinese lane full of boys laughing at you, or when you risk climbing down in a Tibetan pub for a meal of rotten meat.","The timelessness of a concept has to be woven into the running warp of dying time, vertical power has to be wedded to the horizontal earth."],"Ella R. Bloor":["I have always loved to sit in ferry and railroad stations and watch the people, to walk on crowded streets, just walk along among the people, and see their faces, to be among people on street cars and trains and boats.","The capitalist class shoots down mothers and children. It stops at nothing, no matter how monstrous, to prevent the organization of the workers.","I think Whitman more than any other poet possessed the gift of revealing to others the beauty of everything around us, the beauty of nature, the beauty of human beings.","Some of his own closeness to nature, his great love for human beings, was passed on by Whitman to all of us who knew and loved him.","Only with the tools of production in their own hands could the workers ever hope to control their own lives and receive the fruits of their labor.","I shall never forget the despair and agony on the parents' faces on the awful day of the funeral when the 13 little children, victims not only of John D. Rockefeller, but of the government of the state of Colorado were buried."],"Ella Wheeler Wilcox":["No difficulty can discourage, no obstacle dismay, no trouble dishearten the man who has acquired the art of being alive. Difficulties are but dares of fate, obstacles but hurdles to try his skill, troubles but bitter tonics to give him strength; and he rises higher and looms greater after each encounter with adversity.","A weed is but an unloved flower.","To sin by silence, when we should protest, Makes cowards out of men.","With every deed you are sowing a seed, though the harvest you may not see.","One ship drives east and other drives west by the same winds that blow. It's the set of the sails and not the gales that determines the way they go.","Let there be many windows to your soul, that all the glory of the world may beautify it.","Always continue the climb. It is possible for you to do whatever you choose, if you first get to know who you are and are willing to work with a power that is greater than ourselves to do it.","There is no chance, no destiny, no fate, that can circumvent or hinder or control the firm resolve of a determined soul.","And the smile that is worth the praises of earth is the smile that shines through tears.","The spark divine dwells in thee: let it grow.","'Tis easy enough to be pleasant, When life flows along like a song; But the man worth while is the one who will smile when everything goes dead wrong.","So many gods, so many creeds, so many paths that wind and wind while just the art of being kind is all the sad world needs.","You may choose your words like a connoisseur, And polish it up with art, But the word that sways, and stirs, and stays, Is the word that comes from the heart.","The man who radiates good cheer, who makes life happier wherever he meets it, is always a man of vision and faith.","When we tire of well-worn ways, we seek for new. This restless craving in the souls of men spurs them to climb, and to seek the mountain view.","A pat on the back is only a few vertebrae removed from a kick in the pants, but is miles ahead in results.","Love lights more fires than hate extinguishes, and men grow better as the world grows old.","All love that has not friendship for its base, is like a mansion built upon the sand.","With care, and skill, and cunning art, She parried Time's malicious dart, And kept the years at bay, Till passion entered in her heart and aged her in a day!","The splendid discontent of God With chaos made the world. And from the discontent of man The worlds best progress springs.","The truest greatness lies in being kind, the truest wisdom in a happy mind.","Give us that grand word 'woman' once again, and let's have done with 'lady'; one's a term full of fine force, strong, beautiful, and firm, fit for the noblest use of tongue or pen; and one's a word for lackeys.","For an actress to be a success, she must have the face of Venus, the brains of a Minerva, the grace of Terpsichore, the memory of a Macaulay, the figure of Juno, and the hide of a rhinoceros.","It has ever been since time began, and ever will be, till time lose breath, that love is a mood - no more - to man, and love to a woman is life or death.","Earth is the anteroom of Heaven, if we choose to see it so."],"Ella Woodward":["When life gives you Monday, dip it in glitter and sparkle all day.","Stay true to yourself, engage with your followers, and ignore the critics.","The most important thing is to snack on things that are filled with real food and nourishing ingredients that will leave you feeling energised and happy.","A delicious smoothie is a really easy way of taking on lots of amazing skin boosting ingredients and was my first port of call every morning in the run-up to my wedding - I'll throw in frozen berries, banana, spinach, almond butter, almond milk, and oats for a quick breakfast quite often.","For lunch, I tend to eat leftovers. I'm always recipe testing, so I tend to enjoy whatever is left in the fridge. I'm a big snacker, too.","My aim is to get people excited about eating more veggies and seeing them as delicious ingredients rather than a chore.","I'm always cooking big veggie curries for friends with tons of spices, coconut milk, chilli - I'll saute potatoes in the spices, then cook them with all the flavours and stir in some chickpeas and spinach at the end before serving it on a bed of sesame brown rice. It's easy to do and tastes amazing!","I literally never ate fruit or vegetables before. My diet instead revolved around ice cream, chocolate, peanut butter and jelly eaten with a spoon, pick-n-mix, and lots of cereal and pasta - I was a sugar monster.","Making small changes every week over a few months will result in huge changes.","It's crazy to think my blog is being read by people around the world.","I'm conscious of the way I live and do things every day that nourish my body. I eat well, I work out, I try to manage stress, I get a good sleep in, and together, that does wonders.","I wouldn't ever have believed I would marry so young, but it was love at first sight, so there was no point in holding back for the sake of it.","I've always loved the scent of rose; it's just the most beautiful scent. If you open my bathroom cupboard, everything is rose scented.","I'm a neat freak. I find I work best when I feel organised and together, and as I work from home, that means my house is always so tidy!","Healthy eating doesn't have to be crazily complicated; it can actually be so fun.","I really focus on natural products, so I love using unrefined products instead of refined ones. I swap white rice for brown rice or quinoa. I use brown rice pasta instead of regular pasta, nut milk or oat milk instead of dairy milk, and coconut yogurt instead of cows' yoghurt, etc.","There's no such thing as 'bad' food or 'good' food.","If you're struggling with that sweet tooth, try making healthy sugar swaps using things like honey, maple syrup, and medjool dates. These are all completely natural and will satisfy any sweet cravings.","Since September 2013, I have been in a really good place with my health. But I still have to be conscious about keeping it in that good place and taking care of myself.","It's about making small changes at first and adding foods to your diet before you take any away; start with one extra vegetable or fruit at every meal, and hey, presto, that's 21 portions a week.","Food was a big part of our family gatherings, but it was usually pasta. We didn't eat that well. Everything was home-made but not much veg or fruit.","I don't want people to see healthy eating as a diet. I want it to be satisfying food that everyone takes pleasure in eating.","If you have a large family like ours, you have to fight to get your point across, and I think I learned that from my dad.","I want to make vegetables a bit cooler and help people see them as something that can be an interesting, delicious addition to any meal, but that doesn't mean you should feel you only need to eat broccoli!","I love really simple colours at home - lots of cream, beige, and grey with rustic wooden tables.","I work out most days, normally first thing, and then I just see where the day takes me. I recipe test most days, do lots of social media and emails, but nothing else is constant. Some days, I film YouTube videos; other days, I have lots of meetings, work on blog posts, brainstorm ideas, and work on upcoming projects.","With eating well, there's a perception that it's depressing. People think they're just going to meditate and eat kale.","I want to give you a way to eat your broccoli in a way that you actually want to eat it.","I love knowing exactly what you're putting onto your skin and about the ingredient benefits of those products.","I have always kept my beauty regime super simple, but I would say discovering you could use coconut oil to take off eye-makeup remover has been a game changer.","I always carry a little jar of nuts around with me. I roast them beforehand with tamari and thyme to give them a deliciously rich flavour.","Home-made smoothies are a great way of satisfying a sweet tooth. Adding in things like frozen banana will make it taste super sweet and creamy.","I can smell bacon sizzling or chicken roasting and appreciate the aroma, but I don't want to eat it.","I literally couldn't walk down the street; I slept for 16 hours a day, was in chronic pain, had blackouts, never-ending heart palpitations, unbearable stomach issues, constant headaches - the list goes on.","I began researching natural healing, which is how I came to change my diet. Overnight, I gave up refined sugar, gluten, dairy, anything processed or refined, and meat.","For me, I've got no interest in being a celebrity, and I have no interest in doing photographs, going to this party or that.","It was back in 2011 that everything changed. I was not a healthy eater at all. Up until that point, I was a student and a complete sugar addict.","I was really inspired by lots of people I came across who were managing various illnesses through diet and lifestyle. I kind of figured, you know, if it worked for them, then I might as well try it and see if it works. So I did.","I've always been pretty lucky with my skin. I did notice a big change when I changed my diet and started to eat more natural foods in that my skin just got clearer and brighter.","I think the smell of something is so important, especially when you're putting it on your face.","As I started eating more natural foods and thinking about what I was putting into my body, I became more interested in what I was putting on it, too.","Eating well isn't about dieting or deprivation, so you shouldn't feel that you're bound to certain rules.","My problem with the word 'clean' is that it has become too complicated. It has become too loaded. When I first read the term, it meant natural, unprocessed. Now it doesn't mean that at all. It means diet. It means fad.","I'm promoting healthy - healthier - eating, not suggesting everyone should emulate me.","Healthy eating isn't supposed to be about self-denial; it's not a punishment.","I don't know what would happen to me if I ate a bacon sandwich, but I'm just not interested.","I still have a sweet tooth, so I bake a lot, but I'd much rather have one of my sweet potato brownies than a processed chocolate bar.","It's so cool, the number of emails I get from people saying I changed their life. It's pretty crazy.","I love social media, but it made me quite anxious.","You've got to introduce people to things in a way they're going to enjoy.","I didn't believe in marriage; I thought it was a silly concept before I met Matt.","I don't make big promises about losing weight or anything like that. I just suggest things that people can make to make them feel good.","I was a very, very slow learner. I was good at nothing.","Just because I like being healthy doesn't mean I can't have fun - I don't drink excessively, but I'll have a couple of vodka-and-sodas.","Just because you want to eat vegetables and eat well doesn't mean you can't share food and have fun with it. It should still be an exciting thing. It shouldn't be just eating kale on your own in the corner.","I think if you don't enjoy something, it's not sustainable.","Growing up, my dad was the ultimate person for open-mindedness.","I'm not at yoga all the time, but equally, I'm not being sick after a night out.","Honestly, I have been able to accept my father's new relationship because you get to that point with your parents that you realise it's their life, not yours.","Social media is incredible: it creates a community that I'm really proud to be a part of, but it also creates illusions and a false reality, and it's difficult to grow up with that.","I think it's really important to find the right balance for you - a way of eating and living that satisfies you physically and mentally - and that's different for everyone.","Eating a natural diet with loads of fresh fruit and veg and little processed food helps me manage the symptoms of my illness.","I love exercise, but I didn't join a single sports club as a student - I have no hand-eye coordination. Things like yoga are amazing, but anything with a ball just isn't for me.","The first recipe I made was a disaster. I'd been chopping and pressing dates to create a raw brownie, and I thought it would work even better if I blended them in a food processor. So I went and bought one specially. When my boyfriend at the time came over to try the results, he took one bite and spat it out - I'd left the plastic on the blades.","If you only buy one kitchen gadget at uni, make it a NutriBullet.They're relatively small and inexpensive, and they make it so incredibly easy to get all of your portions of fruit and vegetables every day.","If I could go back in time to Freshers' Week, I'd tell myself to make the most of university. Enjoy the fact you have all this time to do things you love. People always say that to you when you're about to start, but you never listen, do you?","What I hear a lot is that fresh, healthy eating isn't accessible. That it's full of bizarre ingredients people have never heard of that are really expensive. There's also a perception that it's time consuming and not very filling.","Believe me, there's nothing I hate more than feeling hungry.","I love Anthropology for kitchenware - they make the best bowls, plates, cutlery etc.","I love cooking and having friends over for dinner, so a beautiful table to sit around is a must.","When I first started blogging, I kept it a secret from my friends and then started to show a few people, and it snowballed from there.","People criticised me for using too many exclamation marks and the word 'awesome' too much, but that's just me.","I think it's essential to engage with your followers. I always used to email bloggers, and no one ever replied, so I try to reply to every comment and question, and although sometimes I regret it when I'm sat on Instagram til 3 A.M., it's worth it.","The things I cook and eat on a regular basis are really inexpensive.","The trick is preventing yourself from becoming overwhelmed; just adding in one new serving of fruit or veg a day is fantastic. Some sweet potato wedges or guacamole make an insanely delicious addition to any meal, and they're such an easy place to start.","Before I changed my diet, every time I ate, my torso would feel burning hot, and the areas around my lymph nodes would really ache.","My illness is now in remission, and on a day-to-day basis, I truly feel amazing. I wake up with such incredible energy, which I never had before my illness, and I really feel so in tune with my body.","Blogs are amazing, and I'm so grateful to mine for giving me such a great platform to explore other ideas, but it's just not practical to scroll through 30 pages of blog to find a dinner recipe.","There are a million different things that I want to do.","You can add things to savoury dishes as you cook, but sweet dishes are more challenging.","I spent ages learning to take photos, which was a lot of fun, and I think it really helped readers get excited about the recipes.","I don't have one favourite spot - I love writing anywhere that I feel inspired. I have to admit that I do love getting cosy in bed or under blankets on the sofa and writing from there.","I don't really have a 9-5, which I love, as every day is so different.","On a weekday, I'll go for a big bowl of creamy porridge with almond butter and berries if I'm at home, or a super quick chia seed breakfast if I'm running out the door first thing.","I love yoga, pilates, boxing, spinning, and weight lifting and tend to do a mix of them all.","I find both yoga and pilates awesome at calming my mind and strengthening my body.","My whole thing isn't about being vegan, to be honest. It's more about a more natural diet.","If you eat broccoli steamed or boiled, it's not very exciting, but you can roast it with things like turmeric and make it amazing. It's all about how you cook something and what you pair it with.","There are so many amazing plant-based foods out there that I don't feel the urge to eat tofu bacon.","I eat the way I do because I really enjoy it but also because it's the only thing I've found that helps me manage the illness I had, and that plays a big part in it.","I can't sleep with my make-up on. There is something about it. It doesn't matter what time it is; I just can't do it.","I always moisturise in the morning, put my make-up on, and at the end of the day I take it off with coconut oil, wash my face, moisturise, and so often, that's it.","I've always been such a loser with my organisation skills. That has always been one of my sad stand-out points.","I finished my dissertation six weeks early. Who does that? As soon as something comes in, I like it to go out.","I was a real sugar junkie. I don't think I realised I was actually fully addicted to it.","I want everyone to eat whatever makes them happy.","My main aim is to change our perception of how we look at vegetables because I think vegetables have always been put on the side - it's always been your steamed broccoli or boiled broccoli with your meat.","I'm on my phone 24/7 replying to every Instagram comment and message to try and understand how people are seeing us, and their questions and concerns.","You have to separate the negative into two categories - half of it is sensible, constructive things that has made us better. But half of the negative online is negative for the sake of being negative, and it's important for us to remember it's okay they don't like us, and sometimes there's no point in engaging in that.","The free-from aisle is the most depressing place in the supermarket."],"Ellar Coltrane":["I've struggled so much, growing up, with just feeling that my life is valid because it's not filled with these hyper-dramatic moments, and I think a lot of people of my generation feel that way. We're so inundated with hyper-drama that people crave everyday life.","I like acting; I like being lost in the creative process.","I'm interested in all kinds of art. I draw and paint and don't know how to play the banjo, but I do play the banjo.","I was raised to be some kind of artist.","I feel like that's so ingrained in so many children that you are so confined and repressed growing up that, anything you do, you have to rebel against it at some point.","My mom comes from a really out-there upbringing, so for her, the way she raised me is pretty disciplined. I was home-schooled but more really unschooled, really.","I try not to worry about my appearance as much as possible.","I didn't have my parents to rebel against, but I had society, and that definitely is what they taught me. Just: Trust nothing.","I was very angsty from a very young age. The way people start acting when they're 15, I started being at 8.","It was surreal to step out of my own existence and see how most American children experience things.","I was a pretty alert kid, and I, you know, I was very interested in arts.","It's beautiful to have people look me in the eyes and actually treat me like a human.","I don't want to make any general statements, but I feel like so many stories that are presented as being about humanity and human emotion are just so convoluted and overly dramatic and focus on these certain little things that are supposedly meaningful, but just don't really mean anything.","The only thing in life that really gives me any peace is just being lost in the process of creating something, whether it's the film or painting and drawing, which has been a big part of my life, for a long time."],"Elle Fanning":["I don't think you should try to be anything you're not. If you're not smiling all the time or always happy - I don't think it matters. If you're having bad day, show you're having a bad day. Don't try to put up something that's fake.","For my own style, I love vintage. 60's and 70's are my favorite. I love baby doll dresses and the soft colors. I try to mix a little bit of modern into that - maybe I'll wear it with boots. At my school we wear a uniform, but we have one day a week we can wear whatever we want.","I'm a big fish eater. Salmon - I love salmon. My sister loves Chinese food and sushi and all that. I'm not as big of a fan, but she likes it so we eat it a lot. So I'm beginning to like it more. I don't like the raw sushi. I liked the cooked crab and lobster and everything.","I sort of make believe. That's why I like acting. You can create or imagine anything.","I have a sliding glass door on my closet, and when I slide it one way I can see all my uniforms, and the other way is all my own clothes.","I'm pretty good with not being afraid to just go up to people and introduce myself.","But it's cool working with female directors because I'm a girl, so you do relate to them more. You can talk to them about other stuff like clothes and all that.","I wore the Marc Jacobs dress, so I love Marc Jacobs. He has a vintage flair. But I've always worn a lot of vintage stuff, so it hasn't been a lot of designers. If I see something that I like, I just buy it.","I would like to continue acting. But also - if this is a dream world where everything could become true - I'd want to be a ballerina.","I like to be very girly, with bows and ruffles on the red carpet. I love pastel colours, especially blue. Me and my sister both because of our eyes look good in blues.","Dakota Fanning is my favorite actress.","I'm a normal kid, really. I just love to act.","We take art, and I love all that. But I also like science for some reason. I just like finding out why things happen.","When I go home, I play with my baby dolls and strollers and stuffed animals, pretend like they're real dogs.","What's the best part of a movie? I love to know what my name is. It's just so fun. That's the first thing I ask. It's just fun because you have a different name in every movie.","I mean, it's amazing that I get to meet all these people. I've learned so much from all of them. I just worked with Sofia Coppola and that was amazing. I learned so much from her. I can't even describe how much fun I had.","I love fashion! I love clothes! I really like vintage clothes, so in my closet there's a lot of '50s stuff. I go to the stores and shop around.","I like mixing things. I wear a lot of boots. Love boots. And then jeans, but I like to wear them with a really ruffly top. Or I love high-waisted anything.","I just worked with Sofia Coppola and that was amazing. I learned so much from her. I can't even describe how much fun I had.","My favorite actress is Marilyn Monroe.","I always look at Style.com and look at all the designers and I know all the model's names.","I'd much rather dress like a 5 year old than a 21 year old. I'd much rather wear a puffy sleeved shirt than some low-cut top.","I don't wear any make-up on normal days and at school. But, if I'm going somewhere, I always do something with my eyes - crazy colors, sparkles. I'm all for it. I love experimenting.","I like necklaces that are short, the way skateboarders used to wear them in the seventies.","I like playing characters with as many emotions as possible. I'd love to play a really crazy person - someone truly out of her mind.","For a long time, I refused to wear jeans. I liked high-waisted pants, but jeans made me feel like I wasn't being unique. Even now, I won't wear the skinny-jeans style, because most people wear those - they have to be baggier, boyfriend-looking, or sort of like a mom jean. I'm real funny that way.","After 'Somewhere' came out, people started to recognize me more. Whenever I was walking down the street, they'd be like, 'Oh, wow - are you Elle Fanning?' Before 'Somewhere,' they asked me if I was Dakota Fanning, because we looked alike, and I'd say, 'No, I'm her younger sister.'","I was 12 when I did 'Super 8,' and when Dakota was 12, she did 'War of the Worlds.' Steven Spielberg was involved with both movies, so we both worked with Steven when we were 12.","I would love to do a musical!","I've been on 'Criminal Minds' twice! On the first show, a boy brought kids out to the woods and was beating them with a baseball bat, but I got away. Then they brought Tracy, my character, back - as a kidnapped girl. They saved me two times! Tracy lived!","I can't really remember my life without movies.","I make movies the same way other kids play tennis or go to piano lessons. I'm trying to get better at what I want to do, just like other kids are trying to get better at what they want to do.","I would love to work with Marion Cotillard... and my sister! I've never worked with Dakota before in a movie. It'd be so cool to be on screen interacting with each other one day. It will happen, I'm just not sure when.","When I do a movie, that's just a couple months out of my year and out of my life. All the other months I'm just at home, running around doing errands with my mom and going to sleepovers. I feel like I have that side of my life, and then I also do the films - which is just sort of a plus.","I do after-school ballet and also hip-hop and jazz.","I like Jodie Foster and then Meryl Streep. They're just, like, the greatest ever.","I'll always have acting. But then if I had to choose something else it'd probably be singing or dancing - if I had to. Or maybe, like, designer, like sketching designs.","I love the '70s, I'm very into that right now. The long Chloe dresses, very Virgin Suicides.","I remember the first time Dakota asked me for fashion advice about what to put with what. I was like, 'My big sister is asking me?'"],"Elle King":["Sometimes I'm really funny, sometimes I'm quiet, sometimes I'm shy, but I'm constantly changing.","I followed a guy to Denmark. I came home with a broken heart.","I'm actually a barefoot girl.","My first name is a boy's name. It's Tanner. I've always gone by my middle name but, yeah, my first name is Tanner. And King is my mom's last name. I took my mom's last name since I was 18.","I grew up barefoot, dirty, climbing trees. It made me appreciate things more.","Sometimes, if you fake confidence long enough, you're going to be confident.","As for relationships, I know nothing. I'm an idiot; I can't get it right.","My mom says I was born screaming.","I'm a water baby to no end.","I just love playing live.","I used to be afraid to use the word 'pop' to describe my music, but underneath my tough, bad-girl sound, there's some fun.","I did some stupid things when I was younger, but I got a lot out of my system. Every time, my mom was waiting there with an 'I told you so.' Moms are usually right. You're wrong if you don't think that they've done what we're doing, because they have.","I flip the turntables. I write a lot from the male perspective, but as a female. That's how I live my life. I can roll with the boys.","I have perfected the art of the mean song to make me feel like I have a backbone.","I was born out of a Vegas marriage: My parents got married three days after they met.","I was 18, at art school, and saw this cute boy playing banjo. I was obsessed. I taught myself how to play. I listened to a lot of country and just messed around. The second song I wrote on the banjo was 'Good to Be a Man.' That what's got me signed.","I fall in love fast, and I fall out of love even faster.","I have over 35 tattoos.","You never know which Elle you're going to see day to day, because I wake up in different moods.","I'm really not good at anything else, so if I don't make it as a musician, I'll probably just end up living in the woods with a bunch of dogs.","I have a really supportive, great group of friends, and we all push each other. They come to my shows, I go to their premieres; it's wonderful.","I don't like people who are just takers.","My dream duet would be with Dolly Parton!","I write a lot about myself.","I grew up loving Etta James and Aretha Franklin and Al Green and Otis Redding, and I just love old-school R&B. It's just music that moves you and grooves you, and it was very important, I think, for music.","I'm obsessed with trash TV. I love horrible TV. shows. It's the white trash in me, you know?","I started playing in New York when I was 16. I had a fake ID so I could play shows, and, I don't know, bouncers didn't really say no to me, I guess. I'm fun!","I think the best music is honest music.","I'm a really good friend; I'm terrible to date.","I think I write funny songs that make people kind of, like, stop what they're doing and be like, 'What did you say?' And then it makes them laugh a little bit.","I had a beautiful mother and a famous father, and I didn't know where I fit in.","I started with the guitar around 12 years old but didn't learn the banjo until I was about 18 or 19.","You have to be nice to everybody, and then people want you to succeed.","I love to sing big rock and roll songs; I love to sing country-pop stuff, and then I love to sing soft, sadder beautiful songs."],"Elle Macpherson":["Having children is my greatest achievement. It was my saviour. It switched my focus from the outside to the inside. My children are gifts, they remind me of what's important.","I feel beautiful when I'm at peace with myself. When I'm serene, when I'm a good person, when I've been considerate of others.","It's not vanity to feel you have a right to be beautiful. Women are taught to feel we're not good enough, that we must live up to someone else's standards. But my aim is to cherish myself as I am.","My favorite body part is my heart. Nothing beats loving and being loved.","A celebrity name is never enough for an intelligent mass market... truly successful businesses are born of passion and heartfelt interest.","I don't believe we own our children, they're their own souls who make their own choices, we just guide and support them.","People in the fashion industry have used the press a lot more than people in the film industry, because you have nothing to sell except for the image: The image is everything.","The image is where you have dinner at night, who you're seeing. It's what car you drive and how you dress. People in the industry sell that, and it creates a dream. There's nothing else.","I went to America on holiday when I was 17 and, before I knew it, I'd been signed up by an agency and had these obligations I didn't understand, but which I couldn't say no to. This industry chose me. But I did choose to make it fulfilling.","But I do know focusing on the exterior doesn't make me happy. If I want peace and serenity, it won't be reached by getting thinner or fatter.","I wanted so badly to study ballet, but it was really all about wearing the tutu.","You know, Mamet is not a huge writer of female parts. Most of his movies don't even have women in them, so I'm lucky I'm in it at all.","You check to see the facts are correct where business is concerned but if I read everything that was written about me, I'd end up feeling totally insecure about myself.","If I have a choice between putting my kids to bed and going to a party, I'll put my kids to bed. If I have a choice of going to a restaurant or having friends round, I'll have friends round. Every time.","I've done all this stuff because it's fun. It's never been about fame.","I used to wear heels because I wanted to show people I wasn't ashamed of being tall. But I don't wear them any more because you don't have to wear heels to be beautiful. I can't even remember the last time I wore heels.","I like to make movies I like to watch.","I just happen to like the work. I like preparing for a role. I like reading. I like analyzing. I like literature. I like emotions. I like working with other actors.","I eat like a horse!","I don't like everybody knowing what I'm doing, unless it's related to a movie. I don't like speaking to the press. I never did.","I choose movies, I never choose roles. I look at the script. I look at the director. I look at the other actors - and then the role.","For me, just being on the cover of a magazine wasn't enough. I began to think, what value is there in doing something in which you have no creative input?","For a while I was on the cover of every Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue, which was regarded as the pinnacle of success in America.","Focusing on the way I look makes me uncomfortable. I try to focus on the way I feel - I know what makes me feel better about myself. Reading my child a story makes me feel great, doing my hair nicely doesn't.","Being a public person doesn't necessarily mean you're a piece of meat for everybody.","As long as people want to see me in movies, and as long as I find it interesting, I'll keep working.","Anyway, I believe you don't fix the inside by putting something on the outside.","Acting and modeling have nothing to do with each other.","I try to meditate every morning. It relaxes me, clears my mind, and sets my day off on the right foot before things get too manic.","I try to focus on eating seasonally and organic whenever possible. It can be a challenge, but it has a huge effect on my weight, my health, and the environment."],"Elle Varner":["Everything in my house was either free or under 40 bucks, and people come to my house and can't believe that I picked up everything on the street or in a thrift shop.","I was really heavy growing up, so it was never feeling like the pretty girl, never being popular.","One of my dream collaborations is to work with Sade. I would love to work with Andre 3000, Miguel.","I love all things crafty. I love to make jewelry. I love to cut up old clothes and turn them into something new. I love projects like transforming a busted table into a shiny new table. I'm really into restoration and little side projects.","One of my favorite dishes is this alfredo I make, and I make the sauce from scratch. I love making everything from scratch.","I'm an around-the-way girl. I'm a singer, songwriter. I'm about positivity and spreading a good message and telling the people's story.","As a young girl, I remember singing CeCe Penniston's 'Don't Walk Away.' It was like my jam.","As soon as I could speak, I was singing. Before I could even speak full words, I would make up ones to sing and I have it on tape, too.","I took lessons for about everything you could imagine - gymnastics to karate to flute and piano. My mom always definitely kept me in some kind of class or program, but for guitar, I kinda gave up on then kinda just taught myself. Same thing with piano. I've never been good with following lessons.","One of my biggest musical influences is definitely Ella Fitzgerald as a vocalist.","It was not cool to be that fun, bubbly kid, so I would just go off on my own and sing and make up songs, and that's how I think I developed into the kind of artist and writer that I am.","I think that's my gift in this world is to put experience into music."],"Ellen Barkin":["When I played Leonardo DiCaprio's mother, they liked that Leo had very hooded eyes and a rounded nose with a ball. They said, They look like they could be mother and son.","I am to a fault an introspective person. But I am not a reflective person - except for a big mistake, and then I really think about it.","I have no problem being 53. Why would I want to be 35 again? I want to discover who I am in my 50s. And if I tried too hard to look younger, it would seem that I was uncomfortable with who I am, wouldn't it?","Men who love their mothers treat women wonderfully. And they have enormous respect for women.","Old is the new sexy.","My first movie was 'Diner.' My second movie was 'Tender Mercies.' I did really good work.","Acting is a matter of giving away secrets.","I guess if you're lucky enough not to have to pay your rent, then you or I take much more seriously the kind of work that I do, what it takes for me to leave two teenagers of my own and six stepchildren and a husband and four grandchildren.","When a 12-year-old, a 13-year-old, so desperately wants a baby what she's looking for is the kind of unconditional love a child gives a mother and a mother gives a child.","You've got a movie where the pro-choice family gives their daughter no choice. The pro-life family murders. What seems to be the good mother, the kind of hippie painter, sweet and cute mother has no love for her daughter really.","People tend to remember my performances, not me.","My husband thinks he's compromising if we have one cook instead of three.","No more bare bodies in film scenes for me. For my children's sake, I must stop. The other kids at school keep throwing it up to my children, and they are not kind.","A successful marriage isn't necessarily one that lasts until you're dead.","There's no slow build anymore where you get a little part, then you get a little better part, then a better part, until one day your agent calls you us and says, 'guess what, you're a movie star,' and you say, 'Thank you!'","I have skinny genes. My mother weighs 90 pounds.","I remember my first friend who got sick. It was 1981, and the disease was called the gay cancer. I don't think the word 'AIDS' came out until '84. I just remember it being terrifying as more people got sick. We didn't know how you could catch it, you heard all kinds of crazy things.","I would love to do a television show in New York City.","I guess I worry about weird existential things, like how do we spend our final act. This is a very emotional question. I can't answer it without crying. I think, You're 56 years old, what did you do? You raised two good kids. What am I going to do now that is as meaningful as that? I don't know the answer yet.","I wish I had a little more ambition. But then what would I do? Turn down more roles with more vehemence? Me no likey worky.","I'm Method trained. How is this character like me? What does she think of her mother? What does her mother think of her? It's like construction, and then, yes, you hope you're talented and that the universe aligns and captures the kind of laborer's work you've done and whatever else sprinkles down on you, and it's all caught on film or onstage.","Skinniness is not your friend when you're over 40. I'd like to gain a good 10 pounds, but I did always have a fat, round face that plagued me when I was young. When I started to make movies, I couldn't look at myself.","It is clear I was never the Pretty Girl. I had my two front teeth knocked out when I was 10 and didn't fix them until I was 19. I have a crooked smile and a nose that looks like it's been broken 12 times but never has been. My nose was always red, so people called me Rudolph. My whole face is off-center.","My nickname was Skinabo - 'skin and bones.'","I was trained by Method acting teachers and we were taught that aside from whatever gift you may or may not have or the level of that gift, that you were obliged to know how to build a table. It's a craft. It's like being a ballerina or a violinist.","Would you just strap some toe shoes on and dance 'Swan Lake?' No. Would you just put a violin in your hand and - ? No. I felt that way about acting, and I was taught to feel that way. I didn't come to it on my own.","I'm tenacious, I think - I know - and I do also have a quality where if you tell me I can't do something, if I know I can't do it I'm the first to raise my hand and say, 'I can't do that.' But there is a big Bronx, New York Jew in me that just says, 'Really? Really? You think I - yes, I can. I can do it. I can do it.'","The way Hollywood portrays mothers - you're either all good and saint-like, or you're all bad. And I think the real honesty of motherhood is not given a voice in movies. I miss that as an audience member.","I studied acting for 10 years before I went for an audition. I studied with Lee Strasberg and Actors Studio teachers, and went to the High School of Performing Arts.","But one of the hardest things for me to do was to access anger. I could do it on stage. But when I did it on film it was hard for me. That probably has to do with the intimacy of film. And my own personal issues with expressing anger. So I had to learn how to do that.","'Normal Heart' was my most transcendent moment as an actor.","The more powerful you become, some people especially don't like it that you're a woman. I stick up for myself.","I just would never go audition, and yet I was in very visible places where people would come looking for actors. I say I'm lazy, though I'm sure if I were in therapy for a lot of years, it would turn out to be a lot more than laziness. After awhile, it was, like, too embarrassing for me not to go on auditions. I had to be humiliated into it.","When they make a woman's picture, they treat it like a 'woman's picture.' In the '40s, they didn't treat Joan Crawford movies like that, but as the big movies of their year. I'm upset that there's no 'Terminator' with a woman in Arnold Schwarzenegger's role. Because that would make just as much money.","It's no stretch to picture me standing next to Al Pacino or Robert De Niro. Those are ethnic New York men. I'm an ethnic New York girl. Everybody has their limitations. I mean, I should never be cast as Queen Elizabeth.","I'm not limited by my gender, and I don't think anyone else should be either. Because I am the age I am and I sort of rode the crest of the first profound post-suffragette feminists, I wasn't fighting to burn my bra. Those women fought that fight just seconds before I came into womanhood.","There is a certain androgyny to my appeal.","I'm just curious, who's more fit to raise a child? A loving committed same-sex couple or an unmarried 15-year-old with no income and really no skills to parent?","With all of the divisiveness that is going on in the country we live in, so much of it is based around just fear of the other. And anyone who does not look like me, walk like me, talk like me, have sex like me, they're the other and I'm afraid of them. And hopefully we will learn that it's just not scary. There's nothing to be afraid of.","I have huge hands and feet. I'm 5'6\" and wear a size 10 shoe.","I'd never say I'll never have a facelift, but I'm way too scared of looking like a different person. I have no philosophical or political position on plastic surgery; I just don't want to look crazy. And I don't like not being able to tell how old someone is: It's creepy.","Gabriel Byrne is an extraordinary human being. We have two extraordinary kids and we work at it. We were always friends. He stuck by me through very hard times, and I hope he'd say the same about me.","I like being married. I like taking care of people, having someone to make dinner for.","I'm a little more extreme than a homebody. Unless there's some event I really have to go to, I don't like to leave my house.","I eat cheese and salami and a lot of fried chicken. I eat a big bag of oatmeal-raisin cookies every night and I don't gain weight. I still look OK as long as I'm dressed."],"Ellen Bass":["I think many people love poetry who don't know they love it. People are sometimes afraid of poetry, or they've been introduced to poetry that doesn't speak to them.","I live in Santa Cruz. I moved here in 1974 and couldn't leave.","I wanted to be a writer since I was in high school, but I never thought it was possible.","So much inspires me. People living their lives with courage, beauty of all kinds, nature in all its aspects, people I love and people I hardly know, and, of course, other poets.","Poetry is the most intimate of all writing. I want to speak first from me to myself and then from me to you.","Garrison Keillor read several of my poems on 'The Writer's Almanac' and I've heard from listeners nationally and internationally. That's one of the great gifts of email."],"Ellen Burstyn":["What a lovely surprise to finally discover how unlonely being alone can be.","There was no such thing as child abuse. Parents owned their children. They could do whatever they wanted.","I'm always learning and trying new things. When you stop learning, you start dying.","I couldn't kill a chicken, I couldn't kill a cow - I was a vegetarian too at that time - so I thought, well what is there that I could kill? I couldn't kill this and I couldn't kill that.","I feel eager to learn as much as I can, not only about my craft but the world and the cosmos and how we got here and whether there's any purpose to our being here.","She goes from one addiction to another. All are ways for her to not feel her feelings.","The real work of an actor goes on inside, and I don't think it changes from director to director - I always go for broke! But I don't get a lot of direction, unfortunately.","Nobody would want to leave that film to go get high.","There's no doubt that the patriarchy that we live in also controls the movie industry. The heads of the studios are men, and it's reflected in the scripts they buy and the work that gets made.","I did my famous cabbage soup diet, so I was able to do it.","I've lived most of my life in Manhattan, but as close as Brooklyn is to Manhattan, there are people who live there who have been to Manhattan maybe once or twice.","I talked to women who lived there, to get their speech patterns and outlook on life - and how narrow that is.","To me, it's a very moral film. If my son were a teenager now, I would drag him to see it.","It's about avoiding reality through various escape routes that become addictions and lead to Hell. My character is addicted to television, chocolate, coffee, to her dream of her son, which has no basis in reality.","Their life is about getting enough money to put food on the table to feed their children, and that's it.","I sketched out a rough story for them and the director said, well it's a good story but we have the go-ahead from Universal to make this script and did I want to do it. I said no, and they left.","They pulled Resurrection out of the theatres, so it was running in New York and I was nominated for the Oscar and there was no ad in the newspapers to say it was running. So it was literally killed.","It's a sin to have your films not to make money.","I do like to work with young directors because it's such a difficult business that I think after directors have been around a while sometimes, not always, but sometimes their passion gets siphoned off because they get hurt.","She loses 50 pounds in the film, and goes from fairly sane to totally out of her mind. So for the first part of the film I was wearing a 40 pound fat suit, which is very, very uncomfortable. But the worst part was the neck.","The interesting thing about doing a play is to find a way to make it fresh and do it as though you were doing it for the first time.","I wanted to work on this central problem of killing. How you go about killing. Now, in the film I had to kill my children - well, I didn't want to get that far.","Well my taste wasn't very good when I first started out. But later, when I began to appreciate the art of acting, I would say the actress I most admire is Vanessa Redgrave.","So I was at the Actor's Studio, thinking about this, and I happened to glance over to the other side of the stage and I saw the ugliest chair I have ever seen. And I thought, 'Well, I could kill that chair!'","I always wanted to play Joan of Arc. I've always wanted to do that. Now I'm thinking, 'Maybe there's a story in Joan of Arc's mother!' If I don't hurry up, her grandmother!","It's been awhile. My Oscar is getting kind of tarnished. I looked at it a couple of years ago and thought I really needed a new one.","My mother was very glamorous. She was very beautiful, and she had a lot of friends; she was fun and loved to drink.","All of my life I have asked the question, 'Who would I be if I had grown up in a loving home?' And I have no way to answer it. I don't know if I would be placid and satisfied with whatever is around me - a happy, jolly, sedentary person.","With all the awards I've won, you'd think that I'd at least be able to make a living. It's a really terrible situation.","I've never done anything in my career that has gotten as much attention as 'House of Cards.'","When we did 'The Last Picture Show,' the whole cast was unknowns, and we all got careers from it. Well, I don't think this could be done now.","What happens is you submit your script with an idea of what the budget might be, and the financier will offer you less than that. In order to do it for less, it means cutting out the art, usually.","With 'The Last Picture Show,' Peter Bogdanovich brought the script to the company that made it. They liked it, and they gave him the money he needed to make the film. He cast it with the actors that he thought were right for the parts. Now, it's the reverse.","I've always wanted to work with my friend Al Pacino.","It's interesting: John Calley at Warner Bros. helped me put 'Alice' together. It was very unusual back then for a studio to support an actress the way he backed and supported me. He even asked me if I wanted to direct the film, which I didn't feel prepared to at that point.","Today, people like Reese Witherspoon and Meryl Streep have vowed to improve the opportunities for women, but those promises are still unusual.","The only Shakespeare I ever did was a production of 'A Midsummer Night's Dream' two years in a row in my garden in Rockland County on the Hudson River in the 1980s. I had all the actors from the Actors Studio come out, and we made our own costumes.","When I was 19, I took a train from Houston to New York, and I had in my lap the collected works of William Shakespeare. The play I read on that journey was 'Titus Andronicus.'","I'm interested in the cosmos. I want to know what's out there and how connected we are.","I was doing the work I was capable of doing with my own native talent, but when I looked at actors like Marlon Brando, Jimmy Dean, Kim Stanley, and Geraldine Page, I knew that they knew something that I didn't know. I wanted to find out what that was.","I left my career in Hollywood, moved back to New York, and went to Lee Strasberg and studied with him for the rest of his life.","I feel compassion is so important to develop in ourselves. It's one of the most important elements of being a human being.","I eat healthily and exercise, and I'm not giving up and saying I'm too old - I'm just determined to keep on marching with enthusiasm and interest and curiosity.","We can all live longer, better, than we ever could before. You don't have to retire.","Directors tend to kind of let me do what I want to do.","I've liked all the directors I've worked with a lot. And the ones I like best are the ones that have really good taste about what take was best."],"Ellen Chenoweth":["I like spending a lot of time fine-tuning all the small characters. I think it really pays off.","I go to a lot of plays. I tend to prefer the off-Broadway and off-off-Broadway more than the Broadway shows. That's where I see people that I might not know."],"Ellen Datlow":["Dolls fire our collective imagination, for better and - too often - for worse. From life-size dolls the same height as the little girls who carry them, to dolls whose long hair can 'grow' longer, to Barbie and her fashionable sisters, dolls do double duty as child's play and the focus of adult art and adult fear.","Dolls, perhaps more than any other object, demonstrate just how thin the line between love and fear, comfort and horror, can be. They are objects of love and sources of reassurance for children, coveted prizes for collectors, sources of terror and horror in numerous movies, television shows, books, and stories.","I am a collector of dolls and doll parts. I'm rarely creeped out by most dolls, either in real life or in literature, but I know many people who are.","Despite the fact that he's been dead for over seventy years and his prose considered purple and overwrought by many, H.P. Lovecraft's work is still widely read and has remained influential for generations.","Horror isn't only about ghosts or monsters. For example, paranormal romance seems the antithesis of horror. Once you have a sexy, fun vampire who is sweet, and you have a happy ending, it's not horror.","Editing cannot be taught. Developing your own taste cannot be taught.","I think most new writers are better off going with traditional publishers who will actually, at a minimum, edit your work, package it well, and market it for you.","Amanda Hocking and Hugh Howey have been successful in their self-publishing ventures. But notice that Hocking would prefer to write and hand over the editing, promotion, and selling to a traditional publisher.","I hate being bored when I read a story. Even a well-trod theme can be made fresh by a different perspective or fresh writing.","Horror is edgier. Dark fantasy feels mushier to me. Finding the difference - it's an instinct. And they overlap a lot.","I feel lucky that I get to read and publish stories that are not necessarily overtly horror in 'Best Horror of the Year.'","I'll read any anthologies or collection I can get my hands on. If I find a book mentioned in 'Publisher's Weekly,' and it looks like it will be dark, I'll track it down.","I realized very young that I loved reading and wanted to do something related to books/reading for a living. I didn't think of publishing, really, until I was out of college.","The genres of the fantastic and the grotesque are far more interesting to me than most mnemonic fiction.","I generally find fiction without some move to the weird, less imaginative, dull, prosaic. Not all of it, of course, but a lot of it. I suppose it's just a question of taste."],"Ellen DeGeneres":["Here are the values that I stand for: honesty, equality, kindness, compassion, treating people the way you want to be treated and helping those in need. To me, those are traditional values.","We focus so much on our differences, and that is creating, I think, a lot of chaos and negativity and bullying in the world. And I think if everybody focused on what we all have in common - which is - we all want to be happy.","If we're destroying our trees and destroying our environment and hurting animals and hurting one another and all that stuff, there's got to be a very powerful energy to fight that. I think we need more love in the world. We need more kindness, more compassion, more joy, more laughter. I definitely want to contribute to that.","Most comedy is based on getting a laugh at somebody else's expense. And I find that that's just a form of bullying in a major way. So I want to be an example that you can be funny and be kind, and make people laugh without hurting somebody else's feelings.","We need more kindness, more compassion, more joy, more laughter. I definitely want to contribute to that.","I'm not an activist; I don't look for controversy. I'm not a political person, but I'm a person with compassion. I care passionately about equal rights. I care about human rights. I care about animal rights.","Find out who you are and be that person. That's what your soul was put on this Earth to be. Find that truth, live that truth and everything else will come.","I have sadness in me. I have anger in me. I have heartbreak in me.","I ask people why they have deer heads on their walls. They always say because it's such a beautiful animal. There you go. I think my mother is attractive, but I have photographs of her.","I had everything I'd hoped for, but I wasn't being myself. So I decided to be honest about who I was. It was strange: The people who loved me for being funny suddenly didn't like me for being... me.","I work really hard at trying to see the big picture and not getting stuck in ego. I believe we're all put on this planet for a purpose, and we all have a different purpose... When you connect with that love and that compassion, that's when everything unfolds.","My grandmother started walking five miles a day when she was sixty. She's ninety-seven now, and we don't know where the hell she is.","Sometimes you can't see yourself clearly until you see yourself through the eyes of others.","I get those fleeting, beautiful moments of inner peace and stillness - and then the other 23 hours and 45 minutes of the day, I'm a human trying to make it through in this world.","So many people prefer to live in drama because it's comfortable. It's like someone staying in a bad marriage or relationship - it's actually easier to stay because they know what to expect every day, versus leaving and not knowing what to expect.","It's our challenges and obstacles that give us layers of depth and make us interesting. Are they fun when they happen? No. But they are what make us unique. And that's what I know for sure... I think.","Nothing says holidays, like a cheese log.","I say always follow your passion, no matter what, because even if it's not the same financial success, it'll lead you to the money that'll make you the happiest.","I don't pay attention to the number of birthdays. It's weird when I say I'm 53. It just is crazy that I'm 53. I think I'm very immature. I feel like a kid. That's why my back goes out all the time, because I completely forget I can't do certain things anymore - like doing the plank for 10 minutes.","Right before I decided to come out, I went on a spiritual retreat called 'Changing the Inner Dialogue of Your Subconscious Mind.' I'd never been to anything like it before, and all my friends were taking bets on how long I'd last with no TV, no radio, no phone. But for me that was the beginning of paying attention to all the little things.","A lot of money with the wrong career is not going to make you happy. If you have money without happiness, it doesn't mean anything. It's all about happiness.","I was raised around heterosexuals, as all heterosexuals are, that's where us gay people come from... you heterosexuals.","I just feel like every kid is growing up too fast and they're seeing too much. Everything is about sex, and that's fine for me. I'm not saying I don't like it. But I don't think it should be everywhere, where kids are exposed to everything sexual. Because they have to have some innocence; there's just no innocence left.","I like being busy and juggling a lot of things at the same time. I get bored easily, so I need to do a lot.","We have two dogs, Mabel and Wolf, and three cats at home, Charlie, George and Chairman. We have two cats on our farm, Tom and Little Sister, two horses, and two mini horses, Hannah and Tricky. We also have two cows, Holy and Madonna. And those are only the animals we let sleep in our bed.","People always ask me, 'Were you funny as a child?' Well, no, I was an accountant.","The world is full of a lot of fear and a lot of negativity, and a lot of judgment. I just think people need to start shifting into joy and happiness. As corny as it sounds, we need to make a shift.","I learned compassion from being discriminated against. Everything bad that's ever happened to me has taught me compassion.","I would love for the world to be happier.","When we were growing up our parents somehow made it clear that being famous was good. And I mistakenly thought that if I was famous then everyone would love me.","I am saddened by how people treat one another and how we are so shut off from one another and how we judge one another, when the truth is, we are all one connected thing. We are all from the same exact molecules.","I'm grateful for everything. I'm grateful for my health, and I'm so grateful for the love in my life.","I became vegan because I saw footage of what really goes on in the slaughterhouses and on the dairy farms.","People love gossip. It's the biggest thing that keeps the entertainment industry going.","I hate having to do small talk. I'd rather talk about deep subjects. I'd rather talk about meditation, or the world, or the trees or animals, than small, inane, you know, banter.","I have a great career, and I have wonderful fans who really are supportive and loyal - because I'm not hiding anything from them.","Hosting the Oscars is pretty much the scariest thing you can do. To me, this is right up there with bungee jumping!","In the beginning there was nothing. God said, 'Let there be light!' And there was light. There was still nothing, but you could see it a whole lot better.","I think everybody should have the same anger towards the injustice that's happening and the hatred that's happening, and just fight it with love and compassion.","You have to stay in shape. My grandmother, she started walking five miles a day when she was 60. She's 97 today and we don't know where the hell she is.","Just go up to somebody on the street and say 'You're it!' and then run away.","I'm a lesbian, an Aquarian, and a vegetarian.","I'm a comedian, and I definitely see the humor in a lot of things. I am also sad a lot. I cry often and easily. I think you're supposed to feel all kinds of things.","I just want to find somebody special, somebody that I click with.","If you want to get rid of stuff, you can always do a good spring-cleaning. Or you can do what I do. Move.","I used to beat myself up about weight and working out, and no matter what I did I never felt good about myself. I decided to accept myself and know that I am good.","Even before I knew I was gay, I knew I didn't want to have a child. I knew I didn't want to have one. I never want to have to release it from me. Listen, I love babies. I love children. And I melt when I'm around them. I also love my freedom and I love that I can sleep at night.","I didn't see deep emotion from my parents. It was all very polite and very surface. I never knew how anybody was feeling.","People love their animals so much so that they put little clothes on them and necklaces and booties and things like that. And if you love your animal, then you should feed them something that's not dangerous for them. There's a lot of poisonous stuff that they're putting in a lot of that food, those by-products.","Yeah I'm thirty-six, but on the show I'm thirty-two. Nobody wants to watch a thirty-six year old woman, so they decided to make me thirty-two. Much more appealing somehow.","I know that every time I list something that I am, I am potentially alienating a whole group of people. Publicists and managers will encourage you not to say what political party you belong to, what you eat, what you don't eat, who you sleep with and all that stuff.","Trying to get the talk show, looking back on it, we had to beg a lot of station managers to pick up the show because people thought no one would watch it because I'm openly gay.","I'm a fan of people getting together.","I was coming home from kindergarten - well they told me it was kindergarten. I found out later I had been working in a factory for ten years. It's good for a kid to know how to make gloves.","I'm on the patch right now. Where it releases small dosages of approval until I no longer crave it, and then I'm gonna rip it off.","No matter how popular you are as a stand-up - you can go out and fill a 10,000-seat arena and be smart and funny - it's delicate to host an awards show and know where your place is and know that it's not about you, that it's about the people who are nominated, and respect that, but at the same time have your moment to show them who you are.","While I was doing stand-up, I thought I knew for sure that success meant getting everyone to like me. So I became whoever I thought people wanted me to be. I'd say yes when I wanted to say no, and I even wore a few dresses.","My dad is still Christian Scientist. My mom's not, and I'm not. But I believe in God, and that there's a higher power and an intelligence that's bigger than us and that we can rely on. It's not just us, thinking we are the ones in control of everything. That idea gives me support.","I would love to have the same rights as everybody else. I would love, I don't care if it's called marriage. I don't care if it's called, you know, domestic partnership. I don't care what it's called.","I still have the shirt I wore my first time on Johnny Carson's show. Only now I use it as a tablecloth at dinner parties. It was very blousy.","Designing is my hobby. If I didn't do what I do for a living - at some point when I don't do this for a living - I'll probably just do design work. I love finding really special pieces of furniture.","I've moved about 10 times over the past 15 years. I don't move for the sole purpose of getting rid of stuff. I'm not crazy. I also move so that I never have to wash any windows.","If we're destroying our trees and destroying our environment and hurting animals and hurting one another and all that stuff, there's got to be a very powerful energy to fight that. I think we need more love in the world.","If you're going to be honest with yourself, you have to admit that you go into show business wanting people to talk about you and wanting everyone to know who you are. But that also means there are going to be a whole bunch of people who don't like you. No matter who you are.","I'm probably the most honest person you'll ever meet - to a fault, like, I-will-hurt-your-feelings honest. I'm sure if I lied about anything, it would have been silly, but I haven't retained that information.","I get bored easily, so I need to do a lot. I've started a record label, so I get to nurture new talent and talk about music, which is a passion of mine. I've written another book. And I get to come to work and do the TV show, which is always really fun.","Whatever you define family as, family is just a part of belonging to something that takes care of you and nurtures you... and when you have lost that, and you want to get that back, it's pretty easy to get emotional about it.","I love clothes, so when I wear clothes, they're usually somebody's. You know, I'm not wearing Kmart.","I've been trying to find women writers for my staff for a while now and I have three women on my staff and three guys so it's pretty equal. I don't know why that is. It's been the same thing for a while. It's hard for female comedians to stand out. That's weird. That's a shame.","I collect old portraits. They're all just interesting pictures of people, and you just kind of wonder who they were and what they were. There's a guy - I don't know who he is, but he's wearing a suit. He's got his arms folded, and he looks like he sold insurance or something. I'm just wondering why someone painted him.","When people show me clothing that seems very, very feminine, it's hard for me to embrace that, because it just doesn't feel like me.","I have an amazing team; I have amazing producers; I have amazing writers, but at the end of it, it's me making the decisions on the writing, the tone, the editing.","I am a really sensitive person.","I was raised that you don't use something nice until there's someplace to go.","The first house I bought was a little Spanish bungalow on Clinton Street in West Hollywood, right behind the Improv. I was renting it, and I asked the owners if I could buy it, and they were really nice and let me work out a deal. And I fixed it up and later sold it. That was when I realized that if you make some improvements, you can make money.","Portia and I constantly say to each other, 'We are so lucky.' Sometimes it's lying in bed at night before I go to sleep, and I just say thank you to whatever, whoever is out there.","I love kids. But that's such a big commitment. And it seems long-term. It seems like a commitment that you have to stick with. And I just don't know if I can - it's too risky. Like, what if I don't like the kid?","The truth is - and this is corny - I fall more in love with Portia all the time. I really do. She surprises me all the time.","I think they should have a Barbie with a buzz cut.","But seriously, I think overall in the scheme of things winning an Emmy is not important. Let's get our priorities straight. I think we all know what's really important in life - winning an Oscar.","I just like observing people - it's something I've done ever since I was a kid, and I got really good at it. That's a big part of why I became a comedian. My audience is filled with every kind of person you can imagine, and I love that.","I'd like to be more patient! I just want everything now. I've tried to meditate, but it's really hard for me to stay still. I'd like to try to force myself to do it, because everybody says how wonderful meditation is for you, but I can't shut my mind up. So patience and learning is the key.","I do like men and I had, you know, a guy in high school that I wanted to marry desperately. He's the mayor of some small town in Texas. I could be the mayor's wife right now.","People are constantly asking Portia and me if we are going to have children. We thought about it. We love to be around children after they've been fed and bathed. But we ultimately decided that we don't want children of our own. There is far too much glass in our house.","I was raised in an atmosphere of 'everything's fine.' But as I got older, I was like, 'Well no, everything's not fine. There is stuff that's sad.' I am a really sensitive person. I think I am too sensitive sometimes.","Faith is part of who I am, yes. I was raised Christian Scientist. The most important thing I saw every single week on the wall at Sunday school was the Golden Rule.","The reason I do what I do is because I was influenced by Steve Martin, by Woody Allen, by Bob Newhart, by Carol Burnett, by Lucille Ball.","I think anybody who wants to be president has to be a politician, but I would like to find somebody who's coming from a loving place instead of a political place.","Comedy can be, especially in a writer's room, really aggressive, kind of a very male-dominated room, and it would be hard for women. It's not a nurturing place. It's not like a lot of women are going to say, I can't wait to live that lifestyle and be in a writer's room until 2 or 3 a.m.","I do have ADD and in real life, I'm all over the place and can hardly focus. If we were talking for, for more than an hour or so, I'd start drifting off... I can't sit still too long.","The first time probably people really were aware of me, I unfortunately had the title of Showtime's Funniest Person in America. And that's a really tough title to travel around with when you're not even known.","The only thing I really recommend, if you're starting out in stand-up is to not try to copy anybody else. You can be influenced by people. I was influenced by Steve Martin and Bob Newhart and Woody Allen, but I never tried to be someone else. I always tried to be myself. And the reason people are successful is they're unique.","There would be nothing to get me to run for president. I don't even understand how anyone would want that job at all. Although I would be able to play golf which I don't seem to have time now.","I wanted to have money; I wanted to be special; I wanted people to like me; I wanted to be famous.","The stand up, everything was accidental. I never grew up and was the class clown and had to get the attention. It was - it really is, I have a career despite myself.","I'm sure there's somebody out there who doesn't like Betty White because she's short and has white hair.","Usually, I wear tennis shoes because my feet are flat, and it hurts to wear anything other than shoes that are cushiony.","People give me such a hard time because I don't wear dresses. What's that got to do with anything?","For some reason, we can't just enjoy somebody else's success. Somehow, that's going to affect us. If they have more, then I have less - and I don't know why.","I didn't grow up in a house - we moved a lot, and we always lived in apartments. But we looked a lot; we went to open houses almost every weekend. I think that's why I always wanted a house.","I never buy a house thinking that I'm going to sell it.","I do fantasize about having my own shop one day.","I've gotten to a place where I really am just settled. Really.","I grew up in a very conservative home.","My father was a first reader in the Christian Science Church, which is similar to being a preacher. There was no drinking, smoking or cursing.","A kid should be told that you can have feelings.","It's not like I grew up playing pranks on people, and I was not that girl in school."],"Ellen Forney":["For one thing, I don't think art needs to be about suffering; sometimes it really seems like it's only the art about pain that is interpreted as profound, and in my work for years I've really tried to deal with subjects that are substantial, not just fluffy, but presented in a more playful, approachable kind of way.","'Marbles' really took so much and such a thorough effort from me that I was so happy to tie that up and have it feel satisfying.","I had this sense that I was part of, sort of a lineage of artists and writers through history that have had mood disorders.","I think that Van Gogh is really the ultimate crazy artist that we all think of.","I find that stability is good for my creativity.","I just really respond to comics. I find it a really exciting medium.","A sense of electrical current was part of my own experience of being manic. The sensation that my mind was spinning and overheating would sometimes build to a sensation like an electrical short - a burst of light, a melting, or dissipating - and I'd get a metallic taste in my mouth, like when you lick a battery.","The way I process things, they way I express myself, is in comics, just as poets process things that they are trying to understand."],"Ellen G. White":["True love is not a strong, fiery, impetuous passion. It is, on the contrary, an element calm and deep. It looks beyond mere externals, and is attracted by qualities alone. It is wise and discriminating, and its devotion is real and abiding.","A Christian reveals true humility by showing the gentleness of Christ, by being always ready to help others, by speaking kind words and performing unselfish acts, which elevate and ennoble the most sacred message that has come to our world.","The greatest want of the world is the want of men - men who will not be bought or sold; men who in their inmost souls are true and honest; men who do not fear to call sin by its right name; men whose conscience is as true to duty as the needle to the pole; men who will stand for the right though the heavens fall.","God tests and proves us by the common occurrences of life. It is the little things which reveal the chapters of the heart.","Do not borrow the productions of other men's brains and pens and recite them as a lesson; but make the most of the talents, the brain power, that God has given you.","If you have other gods before the Lord, your heart will be turned away from serving the only true and living God, who requires the whole heart, the undivided affections. All the heart, all the soul, all the mind, and all the strength, does God require. He will accept of nothing short of this.","Those who are preparing for the coming of Christ should be sober, and watch unto prayer, for our adversary, the Devil, goeth about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour; whom we are to resist steadfast in the faith.","Whatsoever is done out of pure love, be it ever so little or contemptible in the sight of men, is wholly fruitful; for God measures more with how much love one worketh, than the amount he doeth.","A person whose mind is quiet and satisfied in God is in the pathway to health.","Talk unbelief, and you will have unbelief; but talk faith, and you will have faith. According to the seed sown will be the harvest.","Do not sit down in Satan's easy chair of do-little, but arise and aim at the elevated standard which it is your privilege to attain.","Grace, like an angel of mercy, makes his voice heard sweet and clear, repeating the story of the cross, the matchless love of Jesus.","The name, Seventh-day Adventist, is a standing rebuke to the Protestant world. Here is the line of distinction between the worshipers of God, and those who worship the beast, and receive his mark. The great conflict is between the commandments of God and the requirements of the beast.","Who can measure the love Christ felt for a lost world, as he hung upon the cross, suffering for the sins of guilty men? This love was immeasurable. It was infinite.","It is labor that keeps the strong man strong. And spiritual labor, toil and burden-bearing, is what will give strength to the church of Christ.","Christ tears away the wall of partition, the self-love, the dividing prejudice of nationality, and teaches a love for all the human family.","Do not neglect secret prayer, for it is the soul of religion.","If Christians will obey the instructions given to them by Christ and his inspired apostles, they will adorn the religion of the Bible, and save themselves much perplexity and severe trials, which they attribute to their afflictions in consequence of believing unpopular truth.","The words of Christ are of more worth than the opinions of all the physicians in the universe.","The perfection of Christian character depends wholly upon the grace and strength found alone in God.","God requires his servants to walk in the light, and not cover their eyes that they may not discern the working of Satan.","God's people are peculiar. Their spirit cannot mingle with the spirit and influence of the world. You do not wish to bear the Christian name and yet be unworthy of it.","If you lose Heaven, you lose everything; if you gain Heaven, you gain everything.","God requires his people to shine as lights in the world. It is not merely the ministers who are required to do this, but every disciple of Christ. Their conversation should be heavenly.","Love exercised while duty is neglected will make children headstrong, willful, perverse, selfish, and disobedient. If stern duty is left to stand alone without love to soften and win, it will have a similar result. Duty and love must be blended in order that children may be properly disciplined.","Every merciful act to the needy, the suffering, is as though done to Jesus.","Children that have been petted and waited upon, always expect it; and if their expectations are not met, they are disappointed and discouraged. This same disposition will be seen through their whole lives, and they will be helpless, leaning upon others for aid, expecting others to favor them and yield to them.","The sin which is indulged to the greatest extent, which separates us from God and produces so many spiritual disorders, and which are contagious, is selfishness.","God's eye does not slumber. He knows every sin that is hidden from mortal eye.","Love works not for profit nor reward; yet God has ordained that great gain shall be the certain result of every labor of love.","God is love, and His law is love. Its two great principles are love to God and love to man.","Why the Christian life is so difficult to many is because they have a divided heart. They are double-minded, which makes them unstable in all their ways.","The name 'Seventh-day Adventist' carries the true features of our faith in front and will convict the inquiring mind. Like an arrow from the Lord's quiver, it will wound the transgressors of God's law, and will lead to repentance toward God, and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ.","All our words and acts are passing in review before God.","Deal faithfully and truly with your own soul.","It is a great thing to be a child of God, and joint-heir with Jesus Christ. If this is your privilege, you will know the fellowship of Christ's sufferings.","All the food that is put into the stomach that the system cannot derive benefit from, is a burden to nature in her work.","Lightness, jesting, and joking, can only be indulged at the expense of barrenness of soul, and the loss of the favor of God.","By the life we live through the grace of Christ, the character is formed. The original loveliness begins to be restored to the soul. The attributes of the character of Christ are imparted, and the image of the Divine begins to shine forth.","Through the grace of Christ we shall live in obedience to the law of God written upon our hearts. Having the Spirit of Christ, we shall walk even as He walked.","Christian sisters should not at any time dress extravagantly, but at all times dress as neat, modest, and healthful, as their work will allow.","As we lay hold upon the truth of God, its influence must affect us. It must elevate us. It must remove from us every imperfection.","The last great delusion is soon to open before us. Antichrist is to perform his marvelous works in our sight So closely will the counterfeit resemble the true that it will be impossible to distinguish between them except by the Holy Scriptures.","Ministers should impress upon the people the necessity of individual effort. No church can flourish unless its members are workers. The people must lift where the ministers lift.","Only the love that flows from the heart of Christ can heal. Only He in whom that love flows, even as the sap in the tree or the blood in the body, can restore the wounded soul.","We are not our own. We do not belong to ourselves. But we have been purchased with a dear price. We have cost an immense sum, even the sufferings and death of the Son of God.","A consecrated Christian life is ever shedding light and comfort and peace.","God gave our first parents the food He designed that the race should eat. It was contrary to His plan to have the life of any creature taken. There was to be no death in Eden. The fruit of the trees in the garden was the food man's wants required.","All spiritual things are to be treated with sacred dignity. Humility and meekness are in accordance with the life of Christ, but they are to be shown in a dignified way.","Ministers of God's choosing are engaged in a great work. They are warring not merely against men, but Satan and his angels.","Let me tell you that the children from their very birth are born to evil. Satan seems to have control of them. He seems to take possession of their young minds, and they are corrupted. Why do fathers and mothers act as though a lethargy was upon them? They do not mistrust that Satan is sowing evil seed in their families.","The mother cannot expect her daughter to understand the mysteries of housekeeping without education. She should instruct them patiently, lovingly, and make the work as agreeable as she can by her cheerful countenance and encouraging words of approval. If they fail once, twice, or thrice, censure not.","God's promises are all on condition of humble obedience.","The great moral powers of the soul are faith, hope, and love.","Many have a vague idea that they must make some wonderful effort in order to gain the favor of God. But all self-dependence is vain. It is only by connecting with Jesus through faith that the sinner becomes a hopeful, believing child of God.","We are not called upon to enter into controversy with those who hold false theories. Controversy is unprofitable. Christ never entered into it. 'It is written' is the weapon used by the world's Redeemer. Let us keep close to the Word. Let us allow the Lord Jesus and His messengers to testify. We know that their testimony is true.","When music is allowed to take the place of devotion and prayer, it is a terrible curse. Young people assemble together to sing, and, although professed Christians, frequently dishonor God and their faith by their frivolous conversation and their choice of music.","Action gives power. Entire harmony pervades the universe of God. All the heavenly beings are in constant activity; and the Lord Jesus, in His life work, has given an example for every one.","All the riches of the world are not of sufficient value to redeem one perishing soul.","The love of Christ reaches to the very depths of earthly misery and woe, or it would not meet the case of the veriest sinner. It also reaches to the throne of the eternal, or man could not he lifted from his degraded condition, and our necessities would not be met, our desires would be unsatisfied.","We need no fanciful teaching regarding the personality of God. What God desires us to know of Him is revealed in His word and His works. The beautiful things of nature reveal His character and His power as Creator.","Every act, every deed of justice and mercy and benevolence, makes heavenly music in Heaven.","The hope of eternal life is not to be taken up upon slight grounds. It is a subject to be settled between God and your own soul; settled for eternity. A supposed hope, and nothing more, will prove your ruin.","The Bible is our rule of faith and doctrine.","The words of the Bible, and the Bible alone, should be heard from the pulpit.","Jesus alone cleanses from sin; He only can forgive our transgressions.","Ministers should not pray so loud, and long, as to exhaust the strength. It is not necessary to weary the throat and lungs in prayer. God's ear is ever open to hear the heart-felt petitions of his humble servants, and he does not require them to wear out the organs of speech in addressing him.","Love begets love; and thus the love of Christ displayed upon the cross woos and wins the sinner and binds him repenting to the cross, believing and adoring the matchless depths of a Saviour's love.","But God will have a people upon the earth to maintain the Bible, and the Bible only, as the standard of all doctrines and the basis of all reforms.","Music is made one of Satan's most attractive agencies to ensnare souls; but, when turned to a good account, it is a blessing. When abused, it leads the unconsecrated to pride, vanity, and folly.","God requires you individually to come up to the point, to make an entire surrender. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.","I desired to become a Christian, and prayed earnestly for the forgiveness of my sins. I felt a peace of mind resulting, and loved every one, feeling desirous that all should have their sins forgiven, and love Jesus as I did.","Religion will prove to the believer a comforter and a sure guide to the fountain of true happiness.","My appeal to the rich is, Deal liberally with your poor brethren, and use your means to advance the cause of God. The worthy poor, who are made poor by misfortune and sickness, deserve your especial care and help.","True generosity is too frequently eaten up by prosperity and riches.","The death of Christ proclaimed the justice and perpetuity of his Father's law in punishing the transgressor, in that he consented to suffer the penalty of the law himself, in order to save fallen man from its curse.","In Christ was united the human and the divine. His mission was to reconcile God to man, and man to God; to unite the finite with the infinite.","Fixed principles of truth are the only safeguard for youth.","The gospel is a message of peace. Christianity is a system which, received and obeyed, would spread peace, harmony, and happiness throughout the earth.","If you are suffering from your intemperance in eating or in drinking, we that are around you, or associated with you, are affected by your infirmities. We have to suffer on account of the course you pursue, which is wrong. If it has an influence to lessen your powers of mind or body, we are affected by it.","A minister of Jesus Christ should not be regardless of his attitude. If he is the representative of Jesus Christ, his deportment, his attitude, his gestures, should be of that character which will not strike the beholder with disgust.","Sisters, when about their work, should not put on clothing which would make them look like images to frighten the crows from the corn. It is more gratifying to their husbands and children to see them in a becoming, well-fitting, attire, than it can be to merely visitors or strangers.","Souls cannot be saved without exertion.","Study and work and work and study will keep in active exercise both the physical and mental. These two, rightly conducted, will not war against each other.","The life of Christ was a life of humble simplicity, yet how infinitely exalted was his mission. Christ is our example in all things.","There are orphans that can be cared for; but this some will not venture to undertake, for it brings them work more than they care to do, leaving them but little time to please themselves.","Parents should have perfect control over their own spirits, and with mildness and yet firmness bend the will of the child until it shall expect nothing else but to yield to their wishes.","I had often sought for the peace there is in Christ, but I could not seem to find the freedom I desired. A terrible sadness rested on my heart. I could not think of anything I had done to cause me to feel sad; but it seemed to me that I was not good enough to enter Heaven, that such a thing would be altogether too much for me to expect.","It is a fearful mistake for us to neglect the study of the Bible to investigate theories that are misleading, diverting minds from the words of Christ to fallacies of human production.","Ministers should be Bible students. They should thoroughly furnish themselves with the evidences of our faith and hope, and then, with full control of the voice and their feelings, present these evidences in such a manner that the people can calmly weigh them, and decide upon the evidences presented.","The ministers of Christ should possess refinement. All uncouth manners, attitudes and gestures should be discarded, and they should encourage in themselves humble dignity of bearing.","Satan well knows that success can only attend order and harmonious action. He well knows that every thing connected with Heaven is in perfect order.","It is important that we relish the food we eat. If we cannot do this, but eat mechanically, our food does not do us that good it should, and we fail to be nourished and built up by it as we otherwise would be, if we could enjoy the food we take into the stomach.","It is a religious duty for those who cook to learn how to prepare food in different ways, hygienically, for the table, so that it may be eaten with enjoyment.","Ministers have received their wages, and some have their minds too much on their wages. They labor for wages, and lose sight of the sacredness and importance of the work.","I lift my voice of warning against praising or flattering your ministers. I have seen the evil, the dreadful evil, of praising ministers. Never, never speak a word in the praise of ministers to their faces. Exalt God.","High and eternal things have little weight with the youth.","The young among us are, as a general thing, allied to the world. But few maintain a special warfare against the internal foe. But few have an earnest, anxious desire to know and do the will of God.","In consequence of our limited ideas of the sufferings of Christ, we place a low estimate upon the great work of the atonement. The glorious plan of man's salvation was brought about through the infinite love of God the Father. In this divine plan is seen the most marvelous manifestation of the love of God to the fallen race.","Those who are devoted to amusements; who love the society of those who love pleasure, have an aversion to religious exercises.","The young are in great danger. Much evil results from their light and trifling reading. Much time is lost which should be spent in useful employment. Some would even deprive themselves of sleep that they might finish some ridiculous love story.","It is the chief joy of all holy beings to witness the joy and happiness of those around them.","Flesh-meats will depreciate the blood. Cook meat with spices, and eat it with rich cakes and pies, and you have a bad quality of blood.","I prize my seamstress, I value my copyist; but my cook, who knows well how to prepare the food to sustain life, and nourish brain, bone, and muscle, fills the most important place among the helpers in my family.","The masses will reject any theory, however reasonable it may be, if it lays a restriction upon the appetite.","No persons professing to be Christians should enter the marriage relation until the matter has been carefully and prayerfully considered from an elevated standpoint, to see if God can be glorified by the union.","I would warn my brethren and sisters to never flatter persons because of their ability; for they cannot bear it. Self is easily exalted, and in consequence, persons lose their balance.","The Jews did not go into darkness all at once. It was a gradual work, until they could not discern the gift of God in sending his Son.","Those who use tobacco, tea and coffee should lay these idols aside, and put their cost into the treasury of the Lord.","Religion does not consist in making a noise, yet when the soul is filled with the Spirit of the Lord, sweet, heart-felt praise to God glorifies him.","Confound not faith and feeling together. They are distinct. Faith is ours to exercise. Believe, believe. Let your faith take hold of the blessing, and it is yours by faith. Your feelings have nothing to do with this faith.","The more we talk of Jesus, the more of His matchless charms we shall behold.","I see in Jesus matchless charms. I see in Him everything to be desired by the children of men."],"Ellen Gallagher":["I do think you can change the past and the present somehow. Even if something has already happened, it doesn't mean it's settled.","Regardless of your support, you need to make work.","My work is on the one hand laboured, and on the other completely happenstance and intuitive.","My work is on the one hand laboured, and on the other completely happenstance and intuitive. But that's the swish in the work, I think. It's really important to me that the work isn't just sitting on top of something, that the materials are woven together - that they are recognisable and from the world.","When a writer makes something, it's theirs forever. That is the magic for me.","There's so much happenstance, so many accidents - stumbling into something and finding it interesting and living with it over time and building on it. It's okay to work from doubt. You need to be willing to not know."],"Ellen Gilchrist":["My main home is in Fayetteville, Arkansas, a college town in the Ozark Mountains. I live on the highest hill in a quiet cul-de-sac, surrounded by friends.","My childhood is in my brother's house, and I like to visit there and be reminded.","I never thought it was unusual to write, and I've been writing or pretending to write since before I even started school.","I can't conceive of nursing babies and taking care of children and writing, too. I know there are writers that do that, but I'm too single-minded. I can't stand to be interrupted, whether I'm writing a story or dressing a child.","Ever since I was a child, I've kept boxes and drawers and pages of things that I liked. I suppose that it constitutes a journal of sorts, but it's not in a ledger or a notebook.","Having your work honored nationally is a great morale booster.","In the schools of small Midwestern towns, the only aristocracies are of beauty, intelligence, and athletic prowess.","I have lived most of my life in small towns, and I'm in the habit of knowing and talking to everyone.","My ancestors are Highland Scots, and my father's home in north Alabama is so much like northwest Arkansas. I have the same allergies in both places.","I love New York, but I wish they wouldn't put clothes on their dogs.","I love Fayetteville. I like hills and vistas and hardworking people and fighting snow in winter and chiggers in the summer.","The Mississippi coast is not like south Florida, but it always seems warm enough for sandals and short-sleeved shirts, except for now and then.","I love 'E.R.' and I'm not ashamed to admit it. It makes me know I did not waste my life after all by not becoming a medical doctor."],"Ellen Glasgow":["Mediocrity would always win by force of numbers, but it would win only more mediocrity.","All change is not growth, as all movement is not forward.","No matter how vital experience might be while you lived it, no sooner was it ended and dead than it became as lifeless as the piles of dry dust in a school history book.","What happens is not as important as how you react to what happens.","It is lovely, when I forget all birthdays, including my own, to find that somebody remembers me.","No life is so hard that you cannot make it easier by the way you take it.","To teach one's self is to be forced to learn twice.","A tragic irony of life is that we so often achieve success or financial independence after the chief reason for which we sought it has passed away.","Nothing in life is so hard that you can't make it easier by the way you take it.","No idea is so antiquated that it was not once modern. No idea is so modern that it will not someday be antiquated.","He knows so little and knows it so fluently.","Nothing is more consuming, or more illogical, than the desire for remembrance.","I waited and worked, and watched the inferior exalted for nearly thirty years; and when recognition came at last, it was too late to alter events, or to make a difference in living.","Women are one of the Almighty's enigmas to prove to men that He knows more than they do.","Women like to sit down with trouble - as if it were knitting.","I haven't much opinion of words. They're apt to set fire to a dry tongue, that's what I say.","Violence commands both literature and life, and violence is always crude and distorted.","The only difference between a rut and a grave are the dimensions.","Doesn't all experience crumble in the end to mere literary material?","There wouldn't be half as much fun in the world if it weren't for children and men, and there ain't a mite of difference between them under the skins."],"Ellen Goodman":["Normal is getting dressed in clothes that you buy for work, driving through traffic in a car that you are still paying for, in order to get to a job that you need so you can pay for the clothes, car and the house that you leave empty all day in order to afford to live in it.","In journalism, there has always been a tension between getting it first and getting it right.","There's a trick to the Graceful Exit. It begins with the vision to recognize when a job, a life stage, a relationship is over - and to let go. It means leaving what's over without denying its value.","The things we hate about ourselves aren't more real than things we like about ourselves.","Most people do not consider dawn to be an attractive experience - unless they are still up.","When we describe what the other person is really like, I suppose we often picture what we want. We look through the prism of our need.","You can fire your secretary, divorce your spouse, abandon your children. But they remain your co-authors forever.","We criticize mothers for closeness. We criticize fathers for distance. How many of us have expected less from our fathers and appreciated what they gave us more? How many of us always let them off the hook?","I regard this novel as a work without redeeming social value, unless it can be recycled as a cardboard box.","When I was at 'Newsweek' magazine - which, you know, this really sounds like I walked four miles in the snow to school - but I started at 'Newsweek' magazine in 1963, which was before the Civil Rights Act of 1964. So it was actually legal to discriminate against women, and 'Newsweek' did.","Traditions are the guideposts driven deep in our subconscious minds. The most powerful ones are those we can't even describe, aren't even aware of.","Values are not trendy items that are casually traded in.","We owned what we learned back there; the experience and the growth are grafted into our lives.","The women's movement was always going to work in two parts. With one part, we'd break open the doors that were closed to women, and with the other part, we'd walk through, transforming society for men and women. Turns out it was a lot easier to open the doors.","Call me a cockeyed pessimist, but I'm having trouble finding any good news in the trashing of Harriet Miers.","It's self-deceptive to think we're in a post-feminist world when we never tried a feminist world.","Those inevitable dreams where you can't get your column in, you know, and at first they were the Xerox telecopy, and then they were the fax machine, and then they were, you know, email. The anxiety remains the same, but the technology has changed.","I think that having a job in journalism, despite all of the changes, is still a fantastic way to be - make a living observing your society and having a chance to use your voice."],"Ellen Greene":["I'm proud of myself, people love me and respect me, and I like me. I like who I am.","Sometimes the adversities you go through help you become a person you are proud of, and instead of hating what you're going through, maybe bless it because for some reason; it is going to build you into that person that you are proud of being.","It's a very hard thing for all of us to accept ourselves at all the different stages - the horrible side, the wonderful side, the adorable side - and who you are as a grownup. And then to bring what you learned as a child to that grownup: that is the magic of creativity.","I grew up watching old black and white movies where Marlene Dietrich or Jean Harlow would go walking down some cobblestone street in ripped stockings and head into some smoky boite and sing for a pathetic living. That's so what I wanted to be.","Life is going by, and if you don't do something about your dreams and make them a reality and start to love who you are as yourself, then you will not be able to embrace any of those dreams. Who you are is the immense magic.","I like kindness. Who doesn't? Life is definitely too short for self-centered, abusive people.","When I was little, I had to write down what I wanted to be when I grew up, and I wrote, 'I want to be an actress-singer-dancer because you can be a rich fairy princess and tell someone off.'","There was a time in my life that my mother told me that they didn't know whether they were going to send me to college or an institution, and it's rough to hear that... Childhood is tough.","I think creating of any sort, whatever line you're in, is paramount - you can be an architect, you can be a banker, you can be anything - I think that when you create, you're closest to God and yourself."],"Ellen Gustafson":["The abundance of cheap food with low nutritional value in the Western diet has wreaked havoc on our health; in America, one third of children and two thirds of adults are overweight or obese and are more likely to develop diabetes and cardiovascular disease.","I was studying International Relations at Columbia when 9/11 happened, and it made me want understand the security dynamics of the world. I had been more focused on soft power issues - understanding different cultures and such - but once 9/11 happened, I felt like I didn't know anything about security problems.","Once you start thinking about where your products come from and what they 'do,' that's going to be an inherent part of your choice as you purchase products throughout your life.","Every single person who has ever walked down the street with a FEED bag has purchased it. I think that's really relevant because it means that you have got to make that choice to spend that money on that product.","As an anti-hunger advocate, I found the perplexity of the obesity problem and the hunger problem existing side-by-side in our increasingly global food system begged further investigation.","Maybe we need to re-engage our smart, energetic youth around the world to be farmers and find fresh, green technologies that will feed the world more fresh greens.","To address our current food system problems, I propose a series of local, regional, national and global conversations - starting around the dinner table - to rethink the food we produce, buy and eat."],"Ellen Hollman":["I have very poor eyesight, and I can't imagine a world without my glasses or contacts.","I actually play piano and violin, but I don't have a passion for it. It didn't make me wake up in the morning wanting to do it, or go to bed thinking about it.","When I was a kid, I was more interested in beating up boys on the playground than practicing music.","80 percent of learning is visual, so children who can't afford vision correction are at such a disadvantage.","You can tell a lot about a man from his hands. If they don't have any scars or calluses on them, you might as well assume they cry at romantic comedy films, too.","You'll never find me in a gym.","Anything that's slightly dangerous and gets the heart rate going is my kind of workout."],"Ellen Hopkins":["For short term relaxation, I take a hot tub. It's my best way to unblock writers' block, too. For a bit longer relaxation, I enjoy camping. Just being in the wilderness, with no phones or computers or anything I have to do really refreshes my spirit.","People inspire me. Everyone is such an individual and has unique stories. I'm a voyeur. I eavesdrop. Sometimes I ask questions. And sometimes people just want to tell me their stories.","Believe it or not, I sold my first novel, 'Crank,' with only seventy-five pages complete. It was in verse then, and it was hard-hitting then.","Nonfiction speaks to the head. Fiction speaks to the heart. Poetry speaks to the soul. It's the essence of beauty. The essence of pain. It pleases the eye and the ear.","Without poetry, stories would be told in sepia.","I write books for young adults because I truly connect with them on some very deep level. They are our hope, our future, and inspiring them to be the best they can be is very important to me.","Christmas is far and away my favorite holiday. I love everything about it, from the event that inspired it, hoping for a white one, to wrapping presents. But mostly I love having family and friends gathered, and sharing traditions.","I couldn't have known 'Crank' was going to be published, let alone become a big hit. That book was very personal for me: I had to tell the story for myself.","There are people who think it's easier to write books in verse, and it's definitely not.","I write poetry anyway and have for years and years. For me, putting fiction and poetry together is like the best of both worlds.","And at some point I would like to talk my publisher into doing an anthology of my poetry alongside some teen readers' poetry. It would be fun, and really wonderful to get their stuff out there.","I never actually plan sequels. They demand to be done."],"Ellen Johnson Sirleaf":["All girls know that they can be anything now. That transformation is to me one of the most satisfying things.","I stand by it. I take the criticism for it. I think it's unfair, but yes, there is a thing about nepotism, and we all try to respect it.","My mother was the strength. She was the anchor. She was a preacher and a teacher.","The future belongs to us, because we have taken charge of it. We have the commitment, we have the resourcefulness, and we have the strength of our people to share the dream across Africa of clean water for all.","I work hard, I work late, I have nothing on my conscience. When I go to bed, I sleep.","As more men become more educated and women get educated, the value system has to be more enhanced and the respect for human dignity and human life is made better.","Women work harder. And women are more honest; they have less reasons to be corrupt.","We've done a lot to restore Liberia's credibility, Liberia's reputation, Liberia's presence.","In terms of being able to renew my nation, to be able to be able to bring back a devastated country, to restore hope to our people, to lift women and to give them a new horizon, a new ambition and new dreams, in respect of all of that, I think we've accomplished it, and I feel very good about that.","One has to look at my life story to see what I've done. I've paid a heavy price that many people don't realize.","I just think that unless you have that cohesiveness in the family unit, the male character tends to become very dominant, repressive and insensitive. So much of this comes also from a lack of education.","The people of Liberia know what it means to be deprived of clean water, but we also know what it means to see our children to begin to smile again with a restoration of hope and faith in the future.","I beg you I no magician. I can't just wave a magic wand.","I'm not talking about what you hear from 5 per cent of the population on the radio, in the papers. I don't pay attention to it. I travel around the country. I'm happy I have a good relationship with the people.","My mother was a disciplinarian. She believed that when young girls start to go out with young boys, they get married.","My calling was first of all to ensure there was peace in the country, because we could easily have gone back to war. In the midst of the country, there were still warlords; there were many child soldiers who had never gone to school - they were part of the social setting - compromises had to be made.","When I took office, Liberia began to recover from years of neglect. Our people have brought clean water into the heart of Monrovia to children who have never known water from a tap. Efforts are underway to expand water projects as much as possible throughout the country.","Liberia just needs to go through this one political transition and it can really take off. Everything's in place now. We cannot afford to put the country in the hands of someone that lacks the experience.","I think the majority of the Liberian people want peace.","I underestimated the low level of capacity. I also underestimated the cultural roots of corruption.","I don't think people understand the awesomeness of the destruction of this country - its institutions, its infrastructure, its law, its morals.","I've been involved in politics for quite some time. I've held positions, and my experiences are very deep, and I think I have the capacity, the courage, and the character to institute the kinds of reforms that are so desperately needed.","I would like to make sure, first of all, that our women in the informal sector - I mean, these are the farmers and the traders; many of them are not educated, many of them lacking literacy - be able to give them better working conditions. And we've done a lot to be able to achieve that.","I think we're ready for succession. We just must try to do it right.","We have to overcome the practice of male domination - even though it's changing, and changing in Liberia quite drastically."],"Ellen Key":["Love is moral even without legal marriage, but marriage is immoral without love.","Corporal punishment is as humiliating for him who gives it as for him who receives it; it is ineffective besides. Neither shame nor physical pain have any other effect than a hardening one.","Whereas nationalism still seeks power, honour, and glory through means that endanger other countries, patriotism knows that a country's strength and honour can only be permanently safeguarded through concourse with other countries. And whereas nationalism scoffs at the idea of international laws and regulations, patriotism seeks to create such.","At present, the most effective way of preventing war would be for statesmen to direct politics so as to support a sound nationalism. This leads to concordance between people of kindred race and languages, whereas the conquest and coercion of people of different race and language inevitably lead to new wars.","When, in any ethical department, unity is attained between outer demands and inner desires, between nature and conscience, between the needs of society and the individual, the moral formula is void because inner necessity then makes it psychically and physically impossible to break the outer law. Thus, true morality is attained.","At every step the child should be allowed to meet the real experience of life; the thorns should never be plucked from his roses.","When the sense of solidarity has been developed to such a point that each one feels the cause of all others as his own, we shall be drawing near to international and to social peace.","Countless are the women parasites who, to satisfy their craving for pleasure and luxury, impoverish father or husband. These lame limbs in the social organism, which themselves accomplish nothing, but for whom all other limbs work, are the most flagrant example of womanly immorality in the present.","Our age gives the more receptive among the young such a sense of social responsibility that one is inclined at times to fear that social interests may encroach upon individual development, that a knowledge of all the ills affecting the community may act as too powerful a damper on the joys of youth.","When one paints an ideal, one does not need to limit one's imagination.","The exact sciences, which would be considered a priori as little adapted to women, for example mathematics, astronomy and physics, are exactly those in which thus far they have most distinguished themselves. This contains a warning against too precipitate conclusions about the intellectual life of woman.","The storm and stress period of women and the new social and psychological formations thereby entailed must indeed extend far into the twentieth century. This period of conflict will cease only when woman within and out of marriage shall have received legal equality with man.","Education can give you a skill, but a liberal education can give you dignity.","Social motherliness has made women's struggle for liberty the loveliest synthesis of egoism and altruism.","It is not sufficient for the young to devote their enthusiasm, their courage, their ambition, their self-sacrifice to the great ideas of the time; the young must not only preserve but increase their powers if they are to be really equal to their eternal task: that of drawing the age in advance.","Children must be impressed with the fact that the greatest heroes are those who fight to help others, not those who fight for power or glory. They must be made to understand that victory does not prove that the thing fought for is right, nor that defeat proves that a cause is wrong.","When it comes to the application to life of existing laws and morals, woman, because of her willing receptiveness, her elasticity and adaptability combined with her power of tenacious retention, has exerted an influence, the value of which is too vast to be measured.","The work of popular education, the temperance movement, the peace movement, are to a great extent carried on by the young. Their meetings show that the young understand one of their tasks: that of bringing together the different classes through social intercourse.","Everything, everything in war is barbaric... But the worst barbarity of war is that it forces men collectively to commit acts against which individually they would revolt with their whole being.","The married woman as family provider beside the man, often also in place of the man, but always however subservient to the man's dominion - this is the worst form of woman slavery our time has created.","On the question of marriage, as in all other respects, Lutheranism is a compromise, a bridge between two logical views of the universe: the Catholic-Christian and the Individualistic Monist. And bridges are made to go over, not to stand upon.","The havoc wrought by war, which one compares with the havoc wrought by nature, is not an unavoidable fate before which man stands helpless. The natural forces that are the cause of war are human passions, which it lies in our power to change. What are culture and civilization if not the taming of blind forces within us as well as in nature?","On the whole, the experience that the activity of the soul obeys the law of least resistance has been verified even in regard to women's social morals. As a rule, these have been focused on the family and on charity - among other reasons, because woman's sense of duty seldom finds means of expression in other directions.","The belief that we some day shall be able to prevent war is, to me, one with the belief in the possibility of making humanity really human.","The more horrifying this world becomes, the more art becomes abstract.","The educator must above all understand how to wait; to reckon all effects in the light of the future, not of the present.","The emancipation of women is practically the greatest egoistic movement of the nineteenth century, and the most intense affirmation of the right of the self that history has yet seen.","Not observation of a duty but liberty itself is the pledge that assures fidelity.","Art, that great undogmatized church.","Even if national peculiarities in character and in laws occasion differences in the curve which the woman movement describes in the different countries, yet everywhere the movement has had the same causes, must follow the same main direction, and - sooner or later - must have the same effects.","The woman pastor would often be, especially for women and children, a better minister than the clergyman; for them also, the woman judge might often surpass the man in penetration and understanding.","Lack of courage or means often deters the European woman from more independent business activity, and this in spite of increasing freedom to choose her occupation, in spite of brilliant examples of successful undertakings of women, in photography, hotel or boarding-house management, dress-making, etc.","While the women of the older generation were thankful if only they succeeded in obtaining 'a work and a duty,' however monotonous and wearing it might be, the will of the younger generation for a pleasurable labour has fortunately increased.","How the woman movement has elevated woman's work, since it has raised the standard of qualification in many fields and increased the feeling of responsibility in all!","Socialism and the woman movement are two mighty streams which drag along with them great parts of the firm formations which they touch.","If, in the coming thousand years, a feminine culture shall really supplement the masculine, then this will be exactly in the measure in which women have the courage to create and to act as most feminists now do not even dare think.","No one who passively endures an injustice against himself has the material in him to struggle for the rights of others. The one who patiently forbears becomes an accessory to the injustice done to others. He who resists the injustice which he himself meets can open up the way to a higher right for others.","All thoughtful persons perceive that the ideas of the morality of sexual relations upheld by the religions and laws of the Western nations are in our time undergoing a radical transformation.","The condition of all development is not to be content with the present, but to have the courage to ask how everything can be made better and the good fortune to find a right answer to this question in thought or in action.","Unless one believes in a superhuman reason which directs evolution, one is bound to believe in a reason inherent in humanity, a motive power transcending that of each separate people, just as the power of the organism transcends that of the organ. This reason increases in proportion as the unity of mankind becomes established.","Those who profess the faith of Life regard the ideals of mankind as an expression of man's higher needs. Ideals which were once incentives to development thus become a drag upon it whenever life's needs demand new forms that are not recognised by the prevailing idealism.","Christianity is sustained by the knowledge that the object of man's life on earth is his development as an eternal being. Therefore, none of his expressions of life can be an end in itself, but must serve a higher purpose than the earthly life and happiness of the individual - or even than that of the race.","When psychical phenomena have been as much investigated as physical, love will also receive its cumatology - that is, its science of waves. We shall follow the curves of the emotions through the ages, their movement of rise and fall, the oppositions and side-influences by which they have been determined.","Great love, like great genius, can never be a duty: both are life's gracious gifts to its elect.","Like George Sand, the feminism of the present day asserts the right of free thought against the creed of authority in every field; the solidarity of mankind and the cause of peace against the patriotism of militarism; social reform against the existing relations of society.","Education must be based on the certainty that faults cannot be atoned for or blotted out, but must always have their consequences. At the same time, there is the other certainty that, through progressive evolution, by slow adaptation to the conditions of environment, they may be transformed.","For thousands of years, poetry has been picturing love as a mysterious and tragic power. But when anyone says the same thing in plain prose, and adds that life would be colourless and poor without the great passions, then this is called immorality!","What would happen if we finally succeeded in following the directions of nature and recognized that the great secret of education lies hidden in the maxim, 'Do not educate'?","The educator wants the child to be finished at once and perfect. He forces upon the child an unnatural degree of self-mastery, a devotion to duty, a sense of honour - habits that adults get out of with astonishing rapidity.","The art of natural education consists in ignoring the faults of children nine times out of ten, in avoiding immediate interference, which is usually a mistake, and devoting one's whole vigilance to the control of the environment in which the child is growing up, to watching the education which is allowed to go on by itself.","Only by keeping oneself in constant process of growth, under the constant influence of the best things in one's own age, does one become a companion halfway good enough for one's children.","The present practice is to impress one's own discoveries, opinions and principles on the child by constantly directing his actions. The last thing to be realised by the educator is that he really has before him an entirely new soul, a real self whose first and chief right is to think over the things with which he comes in contact.","In every new generation, the impulses supposed to have been rooted out by discipline in the child break forth again when the struggle for existence - of the individual in society, of the society in the life of the state - begins. These passions are not transformed by the prevalent education of the day, but only repressed.","The educator should do anything but advise the child to do what everybody does. He should rather rejoice when he sees in the child tendencies to deviation.","When the crying child is immediately isolated, and it is explained to him at the same time that whoever annoys others must not be with them, if this isolation is the absolute result and cannot be avoided, in the child's mind a basis is laid for the experience that one must be alone when one makes oneself unpleasant or disagreeable.","Every young person has to bear the burden - heavier in proportion as the individuality is richer - of accommodating himself to existence now that it is no longer seen with the eyes of a child, the eyes to which everything is as it should be.","The young must be prepared to experience innumerable disappointments and yet not fail.","The current of emotion, which was formerly directed to gaining eternal bliss, is turned in socialism - in the same degree as the latter is permeated by evolutionism - towards the perfecting of earthly life.","One can best observe a movement of the time - its dangers as well as its advantages - by scrutinising it in its strongest, most pronounced form.","Altered social conditions may remove certain ailments and deformities in existing society. But the new and more beautiful society will not be formed exclusively - or even mainly - by improved conditions, but above all by more perfect human beings.","The serious questions that are talked out or strangled with red tape are more numerous than those that are killed by silence; the number of people whose ideas are knocked on the head in societies is greater in our day than that of the solitary fighters who go under.","War can be prevented only by broad-minded statesmanship - a statesmanship that understands how to enlist people's interests in a leading cause.","It is not a dream that someday, nations will be able to settle their difficulties without war, just as individuals now settle their personal feuds without resorting to arguments of physical strength or sharp steel. For, then, humanity will have created international jurisdiction and a power to enforce its laws.","Just as little as terror - not even the terror of war - can save the world, just as little can hate ever be anything uplifting. Love is the only firm ground for peace - not only love for one's fellowmen, but first of all, love of one's country.","In order to overcome the spirit that creates war, mothers must begin in the tender years of childhood to teach children that right must be the foundation of all might, that authority can be exercised without the help of fists.","The decisive factor for the future of Europe - and before all things, for the 'restoration' of Europe - will be whether political thought and national feelings are influenced by the reality of internationalism.","The simplest formula for the new conception of morality, which is beginning to be opposed to the moral dogma still esteemed by all society, but especially by the women, might be summed up in these words: Love is moral even without legal marriage, but marriage is immoral without love.","The ever clearer consciousness that love can dispense with marriage, yet marriage cannot dispense with love, is already partially recognized by modern society, by the facility of divorce.","Love, as life, will fortunately remain an eternal mystery which no science will be able to penetrate and which reason cannot rule. Our only hope for the future is that man, endowed with a more delicate sense, will listen to the secrets of his own life.","Men have desired, and justly, that women should learn from their confessions in regard to the conflict between man and woman. But woman, because of the conventional conception of womanly purity, has been intimidated from conceding to men a deep insight into her erotic life experiences.","To burn the ideal of a great love into the soul of youth in letters of fire - that is to give him a real moral strength.","Certainly it may, under present imperfect conditions, often be a duty not to destroy the outward form of marriage for the sake of the children. But by no means can this duty be preached as universally binding.","A new principle cannot be put into effect without bringing with it new mistakes. But we may, however, be convinced that the laws of life - to which belongs the law that suffering follows the misuse of freedom - will finally be able to bring everything within its right limits.","Happiness lies so far from man, but he must begin by daring to will it.","It is in the province of home and society that woman has fashioned the customs. Here, women's approval and disapproval, wishes and wants, have been quite as formative and reformative as the action of the sea on the mainland.","Morality in its noblest forms remains inexplicable unless one takes into account that power of growth in the human soul which has led generation after generation from lower religious and ethical standards to higher ones which often clash with worldly advantages.","Tenderness has created the first 'social order' - that of the mother with her offspring. Through motherliness, woman later makes her great contributions to civilization.","The art of living demands that our interest in bringing forth flowers in our family life equal the interest we take in bringing them forth in our window gardens. So long as their home-life aesthetics have not become ethics, women need not expect husbands, children, or servants to feel happy in the homes of their creation.","Ambition has developed into a passion which drives women, as well as men, to great works - and small deeds. Formerly competitors in the race for men, they are now competing in the race for social tasks and distinctions."],"Ellen Klages":["My process is messy and non-linear, full of false starts, fidgets, and errands that I suddenly need to run now; it is a battle to get something - anything - down on paper. I doodle in sketchbooks: bits of ideas, fragments of sentences, character names, single lines of dialogue with no context.","I've come to realize that artists and scientists are alike. They go through the same processes using different tools. They are both driven to answer the question, 'What if?'","Short stories are my favorite art form. A good one is compact and complete, a telling little slice of life, capturing a moment in time that - for the character - defines her, changes her, is the tipping point for all that will follow.","When I write, I try to capture one of those pivotal moments. If I succeed, I have shifted the reader's view of the world, just a little. The character is not the only one to experience change. That is my job, shifting perceptions, one story at a time. The trouble is, I don't like writing. But I love having written.","My father once told me that I have a mind like a lint trap - I pull stuff out of everything, and a lot of it just clings."],"Ellen Malcolm":["I think having Nancy Pelosi as Speaker of the House is going to send a very wonderful lesson to the American public that women can be strong, they can be tough, they can be effective, and they can lead this country as political leaders.","This nation is really ready for a woman president. It's taken time, but we're ready.","EMILY's List members are deeply committed to electing pro-choice Democratic women whom we trust to stand up for our rights, treat us honestly, and make us proud. Our candidates fight for us every day. Blanche Lincoln failed to hold up her end of the bargain.","Having women in office is vital to the health of our democracy because women play a unique role in our society. By and large, women are still the primary caregivers in families, even as we have taken our place in the workforce.","At EMILY's List, we're in the business of expanding the political power of women.","If George W. Bush is the kind of person folks might like to have a beer with, John McCain is the guy you pray you don't get seated next to at a dinner party.","EMILY's List has worked a lot with swing women voters over the years, and one thing we've learned is that they are very cynical about politics and politicians. They very much want help with the challenges facing them and their families, and they feel like most politicians don't understand or want to lift a finger to help them out.","It took us 200 years to elect the first Democratic woman to the Senate in her own right, and that's Barbara Mikulski. Six years later, we had a grand slam: We elected four new Democratic women to the Senate. Sen. Mikulski now has some company.","Between 1972 and 1987, the number of Democratic women in the House had actually gone down, from 14 to 12. EMILY's list started doing House races in 1988.","Women are tough campaigners. They certainly know how to withstand attacks. And I think we make a mistake if we say, as some do, that women should play by different rules, or that they are somehow especially vulnerable to the rules of politics. I don't think that's true.","I was encouraged that a group of women wanted to start WISH List, which works like EMILY's List, only it supports pro-choice Republican women. It was started by one of our members, and I was happy to tell her how we did it and encourage her.","On the national stage and in the neighborhoods of New York, Senator Hillary Clinton has repeatedly put her expertise and power behind solutions that make the lives of the American people safer and more prosperous.","It is with tremendous excitement and pride that EMILY's List endorses Senator Hillary Clinton for president."],"Ellen McLaughlin":["I became frustrated early on as a playwright by a kind of smug smallness in modern drama. There was a lack of what I now understand as courage in the work of others as well as in my own work, and I found I was mildly amused or interested by such plays but not deeply engaged or enlightened.","The sensation of flying is incredible, and it's such a miraculous notion to go into the air and see the world without delineation.","Not just my parents, but teachers, friends, mentors - a host of people are to be thanked for any success I have had, and a whole lot of just plain luck.","One of the reasons I admire David Lindsay-Abaire's work is that he, like the Greeks I've spent so much of my professional life contemplating, is not afraid of taking on the big stuff - huge, human, moral issues - what do we owe to those we love?","I go to the theater because I need help dealing with my life; I want to see the greatest questions addressed. I need to see actors grappling with things that matter.","I'm very comfortable in the air. And if you're really in love with flight, you're in love to a certain extent with being outside of the body, not grounded. The problem is, if you're not in your body, you can't actually feel anything particularly authentically.","When I was in high school, I was going to be a painter because I had a facility for painting. I could do it, but I didn't have anything to say in that medium.","I just realized at some point that I was hopelessly in love with the theater. I fought it for a long time because I thought theater was for, you know, insufferable actors.","The more you head into the maelstrom, the more vulnerable you are, of course. But it's what you owe to whatever gift you have.","I'm an actor and a playwright, and I don't earn much.","In 'Angels in America,' I got to fulfill a lifelong dream. I was in the air eight nights a week for two years, and I just loved it.","I don't do my best work while I'm in therapy. I'm too onto myself immediately seeing meanings in things and more likely to censor myself. I'd rather find images I don't understand. That's what generates the work."],"Ellen Muth":["'What do you really think happens after you die?' That's the question that everyone, everyone, everyone asks. And I'm so sick of it. But my true answer is, I don't know. And there's no way I'm going to find out 'til it happens.","Early in last season, George was very worried about other people's emotions, especially how they saw her, and felt she was outside looking in. This year, she still hopes people will accept her for who she is, but if they don't, she's OK with that.","Ever since I was a little kid, whenever my parents would have company over, I would put on shows, whether they would be magic shows, singing shows, dancing shows, little skits.","First, I used some of my own experiences and observations from attending a public high school. Secondly, I joined in some Internet chat rooms for gays and lesbians.","I find that the majority of the actors I've worked with are extremely sensitive people and very spontaneous people. That's why I always say I'll never date an actor, because they're in love with you one day and the next day they're not.","I hope the film will help mothers and fathers to be aware that 15 is a very vulnerable age.","I'd hope to reach any kid who feels apart from the group - those who seem to be outsiders, who feel different. Kids who want to reach their parents often don't know how to do so.","I'm playing George quite a bit differently this season, and I'm glad you picked up on the fact that she kind of made peace with her situation at the end of last season.","If I did anything 'next', I would do writing.","It was something she didn't want me to do because she thought the rejection would ruin my self-esteem. My father was, like, 'If she wants to try it, let her try it.'","Oddly, because she has that confidence, the people around her like her more. She becomes more a part of the Reaper family, and she also is able to get along with people more outside of their circle as well.","Oh, she didn't schlep me. I schlepped her, actually. I was the one who wanted to be an actress.","Oh, she just happened to be a friend of the producer's. Or, oh, they've been trying to get her from the beginning and she just had a spot open up. There are always little loopholes, so I don't take anything personally anymore.","There were times when there were parts that I was sure I got and then I didn't, and I did get upset. But at this point, it doesn't affect me in the least because I know how the business works.","Things that go on at Happy Times are very funny this year, and if you were watching last year, some of the people you saw then as basically extras emerge as real characters in their own right this season, at least to some degree.","This season is a lot funnier, not as dark, mainly because, well, she has accepted the fact that she is dead. She knows she cannot go back to where she was when she was alive."],"Ellen Ochoa":["I tell students that the opportunities I had were a result of having a good educational background. Education is what allows you to stand out.","What everyone in the astronaut corps shares in common is not gender or ethnic background, but motivation, perseverance, and desire - the desire to participate in a voyage of discovery.","I was always drawn to teachers who made class interesting. In high school, I enjoyed my American and English literature classes because my teachers, Jeanne Dorsey and Dani Barton, created an environment where interaction was important.","Well, with so many space shuttle missions that we've done, I think it's just sort of natural that each one hasn't necessarily gotten the attention that the early ones did.","A hallmark of the Latino community is to help one another, if students are interested in a way to give back and help their communities, becoming a teacher is probably one of the very best ways of doing that.","I hope to continue to inspire our nation's youth to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, and math so they, too, may reach for the stars.","Usually, girls weren't encouraged to go to college and major in math and science. My high school calculus teacher, Ms. Paz Jensen, made math appealing and motivated me to continue studying it in college.","Astronauts are very professional and when they're preparing for launch, they prepare for it as the most serious endeavor of our lives.","It's fun to work the robotic arm in part because it's really a team effort.","I'm honored to be recognized among generations of astronauts who were at the forefront of exploring our universe for the benefit of humankind.","Being an astronaut is a wonderful career. I feel very privileged. But what I really hope for young people is that they find a career they're passionate about, something that's challenging and worthwhile.","Throughout Johnson Space Center's history, contributions to STEM innovation and discoveries has been both through new technologies developed to advance human spaceflight and through educating, inspiring, and hiring students in STEM fields.","I think of it as a good opportunity to let, in particular, school kids know that this job and other interesting jobs in science and engineering are open to anyone who works hard in school and gets a good education and studies math and science. And that it's not just for a select group of people.","I'll tell you, being involved in human space flight, it is an emotional endeavor. I think it brings in the highest highs and the lowest lows.","That's what we want to do here at Johnson Space Center. I think what we have always brought to NASA and brought to the country is trying to push the boundaries, trying to go to the next level.","There was a lot of light and a lot of rumbling and vibration, especially the first minute or minute-and-a-half. And then after about two minutes, when the solid rocket boosters separated, the ride got a lot smoother.","I don't recall any interest in science in particular. It came later in college.","I don't know of any issues associated with alcohol before flight.","These robotic arms, provided by Canada, have been invaluable in allowing us to build, maintain, and repair space structures, and I've been very fortunate to have gotten to operate them.","We are involved in technology development for, you know, missions that we hope to plan that would take us to an asteroid and eventually to Mars.","I realized how important it was to know something about aviation, and it was something I was interested in, so I followed my brother's footsteps and obtained my pilot's license.","We are constantly emphasizing to people that they need to address anything that affects flight safety or mission success - many pathways to do that. We need to understand better what may be preventing people from using those pathways.","We continue to not only operate the International Space Station but to increase its capabilities as well as commercial contributions.","The ISS operates as the 'anchor customer' in low earth orbit to support new commercial space services, including delivery of cargo and, before long, crew transportation services."],"Ellen Page":["I love nicknames. It makes me feel loved. It makes me feel less alone in this world.","When I feel strongly about something, I'm not so quiet.","When we're growing up there are all sorts of people telling us what to do when really what we need is space to work out who to be.","I'm kind of getting more excited about developing my own stuff, or getting involved early in projects and doing my best to make things that I care about happen.","I think the Smart Car is awesome. The only problem is I've been on the freeway and felt like I was going to be blown away like a Tim Hortons coffee cup, so I may have to upgrade to a Mini Cooper - something a little stronger.","I really hope that we'll have a sustainable future on this planet, I really do. So I probably geek out mostly about learning more about how potentially we can hopefully make that happen, hopefully we're not too far lost.","Yeah, people following me down the street and at the airport and all that. I can't imagine what it must be like for people who are, you know, actually famous.","I was maybe 10 or 11 when I saw 'Titanic.' And, yes, I was a fan. I loved it.","I think there's a tremendous amount of guilt that goes on between mothers and daughters, no matter how good or bad their relationships are.","The relationships I've had with my girl friends are so powerful and meaningful. Without them I truly don't know what I'd do.","I've always been drawn to stories and telling them; whether it was through being a part of theater when I was a little kid, or film, or with music, there's just been an innate desire to feel that connection.","And I think it's really easy for people to point out hypocrisy in people's lives.","I don't really want to do the Hollywood thing. I think you ought to try to say something with your movies.","As a girl, you're supposed to love Sleeping Beauty. I mean, who wants to love Sleeping Beauty when you can be Aladdin?","I'm a tomboy from Nova Scotia.","Mind you, Roman Holiday - which is kind of a romantic comedy - is one of my favorite films, and I think Audrey Hepburn is absolutely phenomenal in that movie.","I have trouble sometimes watching actors - even when they do a great job - with an accent.","I wish I was a teenager in the 1970s.","I'm a huge Sissy Spacek fan.","I'm actually just playing honest, whole young women.","I love sport, I grew up playing sports, that's all I did, and it is so invigorating now that I'm supposedly adult to learn something completely new, from the bottom up.","To be in a position, at my age, where I am financially independent, I can help develop things, I can promote stuff that I believe in, I can say no a lot and spend time writing - that is a gift.","I've become really interested in permaculture, simplifying my life and doing everything I can to develop more of a sustainable lifestyle.","I grew up playing sports, but now I feel like I can't, because if I get injured, I'll impair whatever film I'm working on.","I'd ice-skated before, because I'm Canadian and that's what you do as a kid, but I'd never, ever been on quad skates.","I didn't really play dress up when I was a kid, and I'm really T-shirt and jeans-y.","I love playing roles that are physical, absolutely love. Whether it's just that kind of basic level of physicality or whether it's stunts.","I think, because I've been working for a while, I've been working since I was ten, I had the fortune of reading a lot, a lot of scripts.","And I've shot in Prince Edward Island winters, I mean, I've shot in some intense, intense temperatures.","I hate how box-office failures are blamed on an actress, yet I don't see a box-office failure blamed on men.","I think a lot of the time in films, men get roles where they create their own destiny and women are just tools, supporters for that.","But I've never been really rebellious. I've got a lot of support and I'm not pushed so hard that I feel like I'm going to burn out, which is what happens to a lot of actors in their early twenties.","I grew up working in Canada so everything was low budget.","X-Men is massive, like nothing I've ever experienced. But great in its own way.","There's no big budget Canadian movie. Whatever movies are big budget in Canada come from the States. Or also have States financing. Everything's pretty small.","I'm not good at watching stuff that I'm in at all. I should stop. I shouldn't watch something for the first time with a room full of people at Sundance. It's not a good idea.","I think it's obvious when you're watching a movie, and there's people fighting or someone's slipping on the side of the building, that it's fake and it really removes you from it.","There's obviously a lot of tragedy in comedy; I really enjoy the paradox of what a really good comedy is.","I'm a huge fan of the program 'Democracy Now,' which is hosted by Amy Goodman, and I subscribe to the podcast.","I always take the time to eat well and eat locally because it's common sense.","I don't want to become unhealthily attached to what I do. I'm grateful for what I do, but I also want to be able to be OK when I'm not doing it.","The thing that I would say you get the most hate about on social media, in my experience, is if you tweet anything about women's rights or feminism. It blows my mind. But it's the thought of not being a feminist that actually blows my mind.","For me, being out within my life became far more important than being in any movie.","Conversations create change. It's easy to call someone 'enemy,' but there's more to it, right?","I love L.A. I'm a full-blown cheerleader for it.","People ask if I'm concerned about getting pigeonholed. No one asks, 'Ellen, you've done seven straight roles in a row. Shouldn't you shake it up, do something queer?' There's still that double standard.","Fashion once meant dresses and heels, and I didn't know why I'd want to be dressed that way. Now I'm like, 'Oh my God, those Saint Laurent boots!' Those are not words I thought I'd ever say. A beautiful suit is nice. I get fashion now. In fact, I love it.","Acting is very physical, even when it doesn't appear to be. It's about the arc of your body's language through a film.","Producing is a way of finding a great script that nobody's making, and believing in it, and doing what you can to get it made. It lets you work with your friends, people you really love to do something with.","I actually can't watch blood and gore and all those things. I watch Netflix shows with my hand over my face, like, peeking out. Which is funny, because I'm on sets all the time, and I know how those effects are done.","I think of those who are so much less fortunate than me all the time. I came out to people clapping and an outpour of support. And the reality is, for a lot of people, they get kicked out of their homes or are faced with violence."],"Ellen Pompeo":["Really, I don't care if people think I'm too skinny. This is my body. If they don't like it, screw it.","The older you get the more realistic it is that you're significant other is your significant other. I mean, you'll always have your girlfriends or your guy friends, but the person you're married to is usually your No. 1.","You know, Boston people are full of sauce.","There's a remarkable amount of sexism on TV. When male characters are flawed, they're interesting, deep and complex. But when female characters are flawed, they're just a mess. It's good to put more flawed but interesting female characters out there because it promotes equality.","I was never a person who was introduced to junk food.","If I'm bringing joy to people and entertaining people as an actor, then I should be grateful for that and act accordingly, you know?","Acting can be an amazingly cathartic thing - especially for young girls.","Learning about the way people process information and their emotions is hugely helpful to my work.","Women don't take care of themselves because they take care of everybody else.","This is Hollywood. People don't admit mistakes.","You can't really judge characters, because that's when it gets really hard to play them.","I don't like everybody who I see on TV.","Medicine is so fascinating.","I just don't want to be self-obsessed.","Want is misery.","I think for any actor to say they don't like attention is ridiculous. Of course we love attention. But getting attention is different than pretending the attention means something.","Brains don't really smell, but what's amazing about the brain is that it's almost like scrambled eggs or soft tofu, almost like a gel. The brain controls so much of what we do, but you could put your finger right through it.","I didn't have a boyfriend until I was 16, and he was eight years older. My father was furious about this 24-year-old, and I had to hide the relationship.","My mother came from an Irish family of 11 kids and, of course, had a sister who was a nun, so I spent time at a convent and with an aunt and uncle who lived in New York and took me to the theater.","I read a lot of nonfiction - especially books about the brain.","I went up a pants size during my pregnancy.","I don't find acting to be a particularly noble way to make a living. I'm not saving anybody's life, I'm not a teacher, I'm not working for UNICEF. I don't think I'm some big deal.","Where I come from, you don't just say, 'Oh, I'm going to become an actor.' Talk like that and they think you're crazy.","I just worry about the girls who look up to me. I don't want them to think I starve myself or don't eat, and that to be like me that's what they have to do.","We're teaching young girls that this is what they should be focusing on: rich and famous girls who are rich and famous for nothing.","I don't believe in putting on airs. I call it like I see it.","I am who I am, a Southie.","It's easy to get lost in the baby. You have to make sure you give your husband attention.","I want to teach my daughter the importance of exercising and eating healthy as she grows up.","Being a mother is magical.","Happiness is not that easy to achieve, but having a handsome husband, a beautiful baby, and a great job helps.","Being a mother is the most fun job I've ever had.","Cancer is something that touches everyone's lives.","My daily schedule is quite hectic, but I have to put my health first in order to be the best mom and wife I can be.","People love to watch a train wreck, I suppose."],"Ellen Potter":["A lot of times, when I go back to books I loved when I was young, I don't quite understand what it was that I loved about them. Rereading 'The Secret Garden,' I felt a lot like Mary feels when she visits her garden.","I've reread 'The Secret Garden' every year as an adult. I have a battered copy on my bookshelf - it's really quite a mess! The experience of reading the novel keeps deepening for me.","I don't plot my novels - I move along with my characters.","I pretty much always knew I wanted to be a writer. I was writing goofy stories when I was 7 or 8. That was what I call 'wishful-thinking writing.' I grew up in the city and always wanted a horse, but there was no way I was getting a horse. So I wrote all these stories about kids who had horses. It's still fun entering these other worlds.","One professor in college told me flat out I wasn't good enough to enter the creative writing program. I saved that letter and promised myself I would send it back to her when my first book came out.","I resisted children's writing for a long time. I saw myself as a writer of literary fiction. But I had so much more fun writing kids' books.","I write about two hours a day, and I write in fits and spurts - 45 minutes here, a half-hour there - and when I get stuck, which happens often, I take the dogs for a walk. But during the time when I'm not actually writing, I'm thinking.","Books are such quiet things - created in silence, read in silence - yet publishing a book has become a very noisy business. I've been noisy, too. I felt like I had to be in order to connect with my readers.","I had a blog where I tried to be transparent while giving away nothing. I tweeted and Facebooked badly. As a writer, your 'voice' is your calling card, yet my voice was becoming indistinguishable from billions of other voices.","If E.B. White were writing in 2013, would there be a 'Charlotte's Web' trailer and an @SomePig Twitter account? I doubt it. Yet, in a way, he'd be missing out because I'm beginning to think that some of this noise is worth making - and some of it is worth hearing, too."],"Ellen Stofan":["We want to make sure we get living astronauts to the surface of Mars.","It's part of the human character to want to know what's over the next hill, to want to know what's beyond.","One of the big things about space exploration is that it is as expensive as it is complicated, and you need all the countries of the world to help if you want to accomplish big goals.","We're going to understand that there is life on other bodies in the solar system.","You see countries like India really investing in their space program because they see it as inspirational and good for their economy.","Everybody has busy lives, but you can tell people, 'Go outside and look at the night sky. We've been able to demonstrate that every star you see probably has a planet around it.'","The public has an incredible capacity for appreciating the wonder of our planet, our solar system, our universe.","'The Martian' may be fiction, but at NASA, we are working to make it a reality.","Communication is an issue where we can improve, and if I can do anything to help, I am happy to.","What we expect to find, certainly in our own solar system, are probably simple single or multiple-cell forms of life. To get to intelligent life takes stability of conditions over huge, long periods of time.","I always like to say just think you were a doctor with only one patient. You might understand how that person gets sick, how they get better, but you understand nothing about the progression of disease or how humans in general get ill. Now take an Earth scientist: you only have one planet to study.","Humans can actually read a landscape, go through a lot of rocks - crack them open, throw them, pick up the next one. Rovers are great - they do amazing science - but it is a lot more tedious process; they go much less far than a human can cover in a day.","We like to talk about pioneering Mars rather than just exploring Mars, because once we get to Mars, we will set up some sort of permanent presence.","So many people I talk to who work in technology, you ask them, 'What got you interested in science?' and those from my generation say, 'The Apollo landings.'","Being able to have a laboratory on Mars, being able to have some sort of sustained human presence on Mars in the future, I think, is critically important for science.","If you think of the Apollo capsule coming into Earth with a parachute, the Mars atmosphere is just so thin, you've got to find some way of slowing yourself down really rapidly.","My key aim is to get man on the surface of Mars by the mid-2030s.","I live an hour from NASA's HQ in Washington, D.C., and sitting in a jam stresses me out.","To avoid congestion, I get up at 5:10, grab a slice of raisin toast, and leave the house at 6 A.M. My husband, Tim Dunn, who works for an environmental agency, is still asleep when I slip out, and I find that rather annoying.","We're not going to get humans to Mars until at least the mid-2030s, and the world is going to change by then.","With the mission to Mars, the whole world wants to get involved. So we actually have 13 different space agencies from around the world working on the global exploration road map.","Every time I give a talk, I ask the audience - especially if it's kids - how many want to go to Mars. At least half raise their hands. I don't think there's going to be any shortage of volunteers.","To unambiguously settle the questions of whether there was life on Mars, it will take scientists down on the surface.","When we go to explore, we do it as a globe.","People see space as a place where you go and cooperate.","I wish someone would redo 'Dune.'","There's a huge question of whether you really need water for life.","A lot of my role is advocacy, and as a scientist, you're an advocate, too, because you are coming up with a theory and having to convince your fellow scientists that you're right.","Instead of being able to look at smaller interesting research projects, I am trying to see the links between all the research NASA does. For me, that's extremely fun because I get to go play and learn about areas of science that I know nothing about.","When you look at Venus and the Earth, they formed at about the same place in the solar system. They're made of about the same materials; they're about the same size.","Prior to Magellan, due to the fact that we knew it was so hot on Venus, we thought that the rocks at the surface would behave more plastically, more like Silly Putty than like solid rock in the way that we think of it, like the rocks that I'm sitting on.","We have to ask, 'How can we break a huge challenge like sending humans to Mars into a series of doable, affordable steps? How can we break that problem down into chunks in order to keep making progress?'","As a card-carrying space nerd and NASA's chief scientist, I love space movies, from 'Star Trek' to 'Star Wars' to my all-time favorite - 'The Dish', an Australian comedy that celebrates that first moment when Neil Armstrong stepped down onto the surface of our moon.","Mars missions will require up to three years in reduced gravity, so we need to make sure astronauts can not only survive but thrive as they move outward to explore this new world.","As we visit Mars multiple times, we will build up infrastructure on the surface to expand the capabilities and reach of humans on Mars.","We actually look to the scientific community to kind of come back to NASA and tell us what the priorities should be. And then at NASA, we try to look within our budget and say, 'What can we accommodate, and what are the most important things for the nation?'","As chief scientist, it's sort of my job to look at bridges between what we do and to see the connections. But when we try to understand how are planets around other stars habitable... to looking back at the Earth - how are the changes that are taking place, how are they going to affect humanity?","I'm actually a NASA brat. My father was a rocket scientist. He started working at NASA before it was NASA in 1959.","I grew up in this business... A lot of my life has been centered around this question about how NASA is helping us to understand our own home planet... and to understand our place in the universe.","If I had an unlimited budget, I would really be probing that question of life because we know what the questions are, and we know what the destinations are.","Mars was this water-based planet, and we know there was stable water on the surface for a long time, which is critical for life having a chance to develop.","Water-based life is very much an Earth-centric view, and we can push the envelope on that here in our own solar system. We have the methane seas of Titan.","I'm so biased to this issue of the origins of life and the limits of life."],"Ellen Swallow Richards":["If you keep your feathers well oiled the water of criticism will run off as from a duck's back.","The only trouble here is they won't let us study enough. They are so afraid we shall break down and you know the reputation of the College is at stake, for the question is, can girls get a college degree without ruining their health?","We never can tell how our lives may work to the account of the general good, and we are not wise enough to know if we have fulfilled our mission or not.","You cannot make women contented with cooking and cleaning and you need not try.","I prefer surveying for a week to spending a week in fashionable society even of the best class.","Subject the material world to the higher ends by understanding it in all its relations to daily life and action.","If it is a relief to take your clothes off at night, be sure that something is wrong. Clothes should not be a burden. They should be a comfort and a protection.","Work is a sovereign remedy for all ills, and a man who loves to work will never be unhappy.","New England is the home of all that is good and noble with all her sternness and uncompromising opinions."],"Ellen Tauscher":["My heart goes out to victims and survivors of the Hurricane Katrina tragedy and to their families. This disaster will go down in history books as one of the largest natural disasters in U.S. history.","We know we cannot underestimate the importance of emergency planning in our region, nor can we assume we'll have ample warning time. If an earthquake or terrorist attack hits, we won't necessarily have advance alerts or opportunities to double- and triple-check our plans.","At a time when we are facing threats from nations such as North Korea and Iran, and attempting to convince others such as India and Pakistan to become responsible nuclear powers, it is vital that America reclaims the leadership we once had on arms control.","I also believe our country made a promise to veterans and their families. Veterans have kept their end of the bargain, and now, the VA is looking to pull out the rug.","Hurricane Katrina, coupled with Hurricane Rita, which came promptly on Katrina's heels, claimed more than 1,200 American lives. Together, they caused more than $200 billion in damage.","Small businesses are the backbone of our economy.","The government's Small Business Administration reports that small businesses represent 99% of all employers in the U.S. and are responsible for generating well over half of new jobs created.","After working for 14 years on Wall Street and growing up in a family with strong roots in small business, I know how important the entrepreneurial spirit is to attaining the American dream.","An overstretched military undermines homeland security and our ability to meet threats around the world.","As co-chair of the Iraqi Women's Caucus in the House, I've enjoyed the opportunity to collaborate with and hear from Iraqi women elected to serve in the new National Assembly.","Getting our military back on stable footing won't happen overnight. We must start this process now, since future engagements are likely and allies are scarce.","If a budget is designed to show our values, it's clear where the majority stands: against opportunity, against education, and against America's hard-working, tax-paying middle class.","Our brave men and women are fighting around the world and they deserve relief.","Preemption is the right of any nation in order to preserve its National Security; however, preemptive war is a tactic, not a strategy. When used as a strategy preemption dilutes diplomacy, creates an atmosphere of distrust, and promotes regional instability.","President Bush and his administration have tried to pull the wool over our eyes and distract the public from this possibly illegal domestic spying scandal.","Rather than showing themselves to be an ally to the middle class by ending the AMT or repealing it for years to come, my Republican colleagues refused to include it in today's legislation and America's middle class will surely suffer that choice greatly.","The President today once again took the opportunity to reiterate his old, failed national security strategies and present them to the American people as new, dynamic ideas intended to better protect the American people.","Today's tax cuts provide yet another illustration of the Republicans' fiscally irresponsible economic policies that ignore the needs of America's middle class, students, and working families."],"Ellen Terry":["There is all the difference in the world between departure from recognised rules by one who has learned to obey them, and neglect of them through want of training or want of skill or want of understanding. Before you can be eccentric you must know where the circle is.","No amount of skill on the part of the actress can make up for the loss of youth.","Imagination! Imagination! I put it first years ago, when I was asked what qualities I thought necessary for success on the stage.","Eulogy is nice, but one does not learn anything from it.","Conceit is an insuperable obstacle to all progress.","Usefulness! It is not a fascinating word, and the quality is not one of which the aspiring spirit can dream o' nights, yet on the stage it is the first thing to aim at.","If it is the mark of the artist to love art before everything, to renounce everything for its sake, to think all the sweet human things of life well lost if only he may attain something, do some good, great work - then I was never an artist.","Only a great actor finds the difficulties of the actor's art infinite.","Vary the pace... is one of the foundations of all good acting."],"Ellen Ullman":["Programming is the art of algorithm design and the craft of debugging errant code.","Computer programming has always been a self-taught, maverick occupation.","There is always one more bug to fix.","I think technical people now should learn literature, because literature teaches you a great deal about how - the depths and variety of human imagination.","The human mind, as it turns out, is messy.","Genetics is where we come from. It's deeply natural to want to know.","Reading code is like reading all things written: You have to scribble, make a mess, remind yourself that the work comes to you through trial and error and revision.","People imagine that programming is logical, a process like fixing a clock. Nothing could be further from the truth.","I'm a pessimist. But I think I'd describe my pessimism as broken-hearted optimism.","You can only get a beginner's mind once.","Software and digital devices are imbued with the values of their creators.","Through the miracle of natural genetic recombination, each child, with the sole exception of an identical twin, is conceived as a unique being. Even the atmosphere of the womb works its subtle changes, and by the time we emerge into the light, we are our own persons.","If you've ever watched someone who is a mother talk on the phone, feed the dog, bounce the baby, it's just astounding to see someone manage, more or less well, to do all those things. But on a computer, multitasking is really binary. The task is either in the foreground, or it's not.","Human thinking can skip over a great deal, leap over small misunderstandings, can contain ifs and buts in untroubled corners of the mind. But the machine has no corners. Despite all the attempts to see the computer as a brain, the machine has no foreground or background.","Closed environments dominated the computing world of the 1970s and early '80s. An operating system written for a Hewlett-Packard computer ran only on H.P. computers; I.B.M. controlled its software from chips up to the user interfaces.","I think storytelling in general is how we really deeply know things. It's ancient.","The condition of my personal workspace is my own business, as I see it.","To be a programmer is to develop a carefully managed relationship with error. There's no getting around it. You either make your accommodations with failure, or the work will become intolerable.","With all the attention given to the personal computer, it's hard to remember that other companion machine in the room - the printer.","My approach to being a self-taught programmer was to find out who was smart and who would be helpful, and these were - these are both men and women. And without learning from my co-workers, I never could've gone on in the profession as long as I did.","Staring prejudice in the face imposes a cruel discipline: to structure your anger, to achieve a certain dignity, an angry dignity.","With every advance, you have to look over your shoulder and know what you're giving up - look over your shoulder and look at what falls away.","The act of voting, to put it in computing terms, is a question of user interface.","I don't like the idea that Facebook controls how people express themselves and changes it periodically according to whatever algorithms they use to figure out what they should do or the whim of some programmer or some CEO. That bothers me a great deal.","When I am writing, and occasionally achieve single focus and presence, I finally feel that is where I'm supposed to be. Everything else is kind of anxiety.","I was a girl who came into the clubhouse, into the treehouse, with the sign on the door saying, 'No girls allowed,' and the reception was not always a good one.","I am not intimidated by puerile boys acting like pre-teens.","It will not work to keep asking men to change. Many have no real objective to do so. There's no reward for them. Why should they change? They're doing well inside the halls of coding.","What happens to people like myself, who have been involved with computing for a long time, is that you begin to see how many of the 'new' ideas are simply old ones coming back into view on the swing of the pendulum, with new and faster hardware to back it up.","Truly new inventions take time to play out.","I hate to see capable, smart people out of work - young or old.","I don't know where anyone ever got the idea that technology, in and of itself, was a savior. Like all human-created 'progress,' computers are problematic, giving and taking away.","The questions I am often asked about my career tend to concentrate not on how one learns to code but how a woman does.","I broke into the ranks of computing in the early 1980s, when women were just starting to poke their shoulder pads through crowds of men. There was no legal protection against 'hostile environments for women.'","When you lose your Visa card, you get a new card with a new number, and any new charges with the old number are blocked. Why can't we do the same with Social Security numbers?","No one in the government is seriously penalized when Social Security numbers are stolen and misused; only the number-holders suffer.","I'm pretty bad at crying.","I think many people have wonderful stories inside them and the talent to tell those stories. But the writing life, with its isolation and uncertain outcomes, keeps most from the task.","When I am around people I most admire, I tend to hug the wall.","Writing is a very isolating occupation.","My mother told me that my birth mother got pregnant by a married man who didn't want to leave his wife.","Even simple fixes can bring the whole system down.","Before the advent of the Web, if you wanted to sustain a belief in far-fetched ideas, you had to go out into the desert, or live on a compound in the mountains, or move from one badly furnished room to another in a series of safe houses.","I fear for the world the Internet is creating.","What I hope is that those with the knowledge of the humanities break into the closed society where code gets written: invade it.","The world of programmers is not going to change on its own.","When I hear the word 'disruption,' in my mind, I think of all these people in the middle who were earning a living. We will sweep away all that money they were earning, and we will move that to the people at the top.","All things change, but we always have to think: what are we leaving behind?","A computer is not really like us. It is a projection of a very small part of ourselves: that portion devoted to logic, order, rule and clarity.","I'm in no way saying that women can't take a tough code review. I'm saying that no one should have to take one in a boy-puerile atmosphere.","It is one thing for an artist to experiment on a canvas, but it's entirely different to experiment on a living creature.","The brain is plastic, continuously changing its organization.","I won't use Twitter. Twitter posts are thought-farts. I don't care about unconsidered thoughts of the moment.","Some people hit a profession and just keep going deeper into it, making a life and making it more and more stable. That's not been my experience. I always want to try something new.","With code, what it means is what it does. It doesn't express, not really. It's a very bounded conversation. And writing is not bounded. That's what's hard about it.","It has occurred to me that if people really knew how software got written, I'm not sure they'd give their money to a bank or get on an airplane ever again.","The computer's there to serve the human being, not vice versa.","We don't have to live up to our computer.","People talk about computer programmers as if computers are our whole lives. That's simply not true.","It is deep in our nature to make tools.","Our relationship to the computer is much like our relationship to the car: rich, complex, socially messy.","Each new tool we create ends an old relationship with the world and starts a new one. And we're changed by that relationship, inevitably. It changes the way we live, changes our patterns, changes our social organization.","Evolution, dismissed as a sloppy programmer, has seen fit to create us as a wild amalgam of everything that came before us: except for the realm of insects, the whole history of life on earth is inscribed within our bodies.","The web is just another stunning point in the two-hundred-thousand-year history of human beings on earth. The taming of fire; the discovery of penicillin; the publication of 'Jane Eyre' - add anything you like.","Tools are not neutral. The computer is not a neutral tool.","A computer is a general-purpose machine with which we engage to do some of our deepest thinking and analyzing. This tool brings with it assumptions about structuredness, about defined interfaces being better. Computers abhor error.","I hate the new word processors that want to tell you, as you're typing, that you made a mistake. I have to turn off all that crap. It's like, shut up - I'm thinking now. I will worry about that sort of error later. I'm a human being. I can still read this, even though it's wrong. You stupid machine, the fact that you can't is irrelevant to me.","Abhorring error is not necessarily positive.","It had to happen to me sometime: sooner or later, I would have to lose sight of the cutting edge. That moment every technical person fears - the fall into knowledge exhaustion, obsolescence, techno-fuddy-duddyism - there was no reason to think I could escape it forever.","I used to pass by a large computer system with the feeling that it represented the summed-up knowledge of human beings. It reassured me to think of all those programs as a kind of library in which our understanding of the world was recorded in intricate and exquisite detail.","When knowledge passes into code, it changes state; like water turned to ice, it becomes a new thing, with new properties. We use it, but in a human sense, we no longer know it.","Productivity has always been the justification for the prepackaging of programming knowledge. But it is worth asking about the sort of productivity gains that come from the simplifications of click-and-drag.","It's possible to let technology absorb what we know and then re-express it in intricate mechanisms - parts and circuit boards and software objects - mechanisms we can use but do not understand in crucial ways. This not-knowing is fine while everything works as we expected.","I came of technical age with UNIX, where I learned with power-greedy pleasure that you could kill a system right out from under yourself with a single command.","UNIX always presumes you know what you're doing. You're the human being, after all, and it is a mere operating system.","The ability to 'multitask,' to switch rapidly among many competing focuses of attention, has become the hallmark of a successful citizen of the 21st century.","Introduced in the 1960s, multitasking is an engineering strategy for making computers more efficient. Human beings are the slowest elements in a system.","Multitasking, throughput, efficiency - these are excellent machine concepts, useful in the design of computer systems. But are they principles that nurture human thought and imagination?","Internet voting is surely coming. Though online ballots cannot be made secure, though the problems of voter authentication and privacy will remain unsolvable, I suspect we'll go ahead and do it anyway.","After we have put our intimate secrets and credit card numbers online, what can prevent us from putting our elections there as well?","I like the little semi-competencies of human beings, I realize. Governance, after all, is a messy business, a world of demi-solutions and compromise, where ideals are tarnished regularly.","Y2K is showing everyone what technical people have been dealing with for years: the complex, muddled, bug-bitten systems we all depend on, and their nasty tendency toward the occasional disaster.","Y2K has challenged a belief in digital technology that has been almost religious.","Computer systems could not work without standards - an agreement among programs and systems about how they will exchange information.","Watching a program run is not as revealing as reading its code.","Technology does not run backward. Once a technical capability is out there, it is out there for good.","Programmers seem to be changing the world. It would be a relief, for them and for all of us, if they knew something about it.","'I am not adopted; I have mysterious origins.' I have said that sentence many times in the course of my life as an adopted person.","I like mysteries.","Writing was a way to get away from my life as a programmer, so I wanted to write about other things, but of course nobody wanted to publish another story about a family, unless it was extraordinary. When I began writing about my life as a programmer, however, people were interested.","So many people for so many years have promoted technology as the answer to everything. The economy wasn't growing: technology. Poor people: technology. Illness: technology. As if, somehow, technology in and of itself would be a solution. Yet machine values are not always human values.","There's some intimacy in reading, some thoughtfulness that doesn't exist in machine experiences.","Our Constitution is designed to change very slowly. It's a feature, not a bug.","I feel the best villains are the ones you have feelings for.","I really don't like books when characters are just bad or just good.","I don't consider myself a Jewish writer.","I'm a dark thoughts writer.","I think that focusing all experiences through the lens of the Internet is an example of not being able to see history through the eyes of others, to be so enamored of one's present time that one cannot see that the world was once elsewise and was not about you.","Has Google appropriated the word 'search?' If so, I find it sad. Search is a deep human yearning, an ancient trope in the recorded history of human life.","The biggest problem is that people have stopped being critical about the role of the computer in their lives. These machines went from being feared as Big Brother surrogates to being thought of as metaphors for liberty and individual freedom."],"Ellen Wilkinson":["Women have worked hard; starved in prison; given of their time and lives that we might sit in the House of Commons and take part in the legislating of this country.","Tell the Government, our people shall not starve.","I paid for my own education by scholarship until I left university.","My mother's illness fitted into this protest against the treatment of the sick who could not pay, the inefficiency of commercialism, the waste, the extravagance, and the poverty.","But my eyes were riveted on a small slim woman her hair simply coiled into her neck, Katherine Glasier."],"Ellen Willis":["The struggle of democratic secularism, religious tolerance, individual freedom and feminism against authoritarian patriarchal religion, culture and morality is going on all over the world - including the Islamic world, where dissidents are regularly jailed, killed, exiled or merely intimidated and silenced.","As with fascism, the rise of Islamic totalitarianism has partly to do with its populist appeal to the class resentments of an economically oppressed population and to anger at political subordination and humiliation.","I believe that we are all, openly or secretly, struggling against one or another kind of nihilism.","By continually pushing the message that we have the right to gratification now, consumerism at its most expansive encouraged a demand for fulfillment that could not so easily be contained by products.","My deepest impulses are optimistic, an attitude that seems to me as spiritually necessary and proper as it is intellectually suspect.","I can't keep myself from playing roles. The emotionless decadent, looking for diversion from boredom, is a favorite.","What cultural revolutionaries do not seem to grasp is that, far from being a grass-roots art form that has been taken over by businessmen, rock itself comes from the commercial exploitation of the blues.","Mass consumption, advertising, and mass art are a corporate Frankenstein; while they reinforce the system, they also undermine it.","On one level the sixties revolt was an impressive illustration of Lenin's remark that the capitalist will sell you the rope to hang him with.","I believe that body and spirit are not really separate, though it often seems that way. I believe that redemption is never impossible and always equivocal. But I guess that I just don't know.","My education was dominated by modernist thinkers and artists who taught me that the supreme imperative was courage to face the awful truth, to scorn the soft-minded optimism of religious and secular romantics as well as the corrupt optimism of governments, advertisers, and mechanistic or manipulative revolutionaries.","For the most part, Americans speak of culture and politics as if they were two separate realms.","The artificial separation of politics and culture is nowhere more pronounced than in the discourse of foreign policy and international affairs.","You don't have to be Sigmund Freud to surmise that war has a perverse appeal for the human race, nor is the attraction limited to religious fanatics committing mass murder and suicide for the greater glory of God.","To imagine that trauma casts out fantasy is a dangerous mistake.","I was a 'Big Brother' fan. I thought they were better musicians than their detractors claimed, but more to the point, technical accomplishment was not something I cared about.","Give people the power to shape their lives to their liking, and their souls will take care of themselves."],"Ellen Wong":["Toronto is home; nothing beats home.","What does it mean to be a superhero? We're all fighting for the better good. But, at the same time, I think what stands out is, as superheroes, you don't give up; you don't surrender. I think that's what makes a superhero.","'Carrie Diaries' was one of the scripts that was sent my way, and it was instantly something I wanted to work on. It was very charming, and there's a lot of heart to it. It was touching and nostalgic and relatable, and it validates so many coming-of-age issues in an open and honest way. I think it speaks to real life.","Be happy with who you are, and know that being you is the best thing you can do for yourself.","I wasn't able to relate to anyone on TV growing up, so I wanted to bring my own experiences to the screen.","When I'm nervous, I know I care about something - you should be nervous about things that you want.","I just want to keep being creative, and I want to feel inspired by a role, and I want to keep acting.","YI think what's cool about 'Scott Pilgrim' is that it shows that there is a superhero within all of us. There's not one ideal image of what a superhero looks like, and you don't really see that until the end of the film.","A short film is just another storytelling medium like TV, Features, and Webisodes. I am just thrilled that 'Silent Cargo' is getting out there for people to see."],"Ellie Goulding":["I'm obsessed with the countryside: woods, forests, fields, lakes, mountains. I'm really into folk music and folklore. But more so I'm into electronic music. I'm into bands that have both aspects, like Boards of Canada is a perfect example. You could listen to that type of music running through a woods. It's kind of what I wanted to achieve.","I guess I'm just quite observant and I pay attention to a lot of things. Human behavior really fascinates me.","I want to be safe in the knowledge that I can tour and play festivals for a long time. The main thing is that I want a good reputation as a live performer. If I have that, I'd be so happy.","I feel more confident if my makeup looks good.","I want to be more like Pixie Lott. She works really hard but always manages to keep smiling. She never complains.","On stage I have to be comfortable because I play guitar so I can't wear too much jewellery, it knocks against the guitar and makes loud noises. I had this big gold eagle necklace which I love but I kept whacking myself in the face with it so had to stop wearing it. I wear things that I can sweat in, basically... it gets really hot on stage.","I take inspiration from everything around me, also relationships and friends. And the inside of my crazy head.","I was super brainy and a proper geek at school, but there would always be a boy. But that sort of obsession did turn me into a songwriter. My writing has always come from that feeling of infatuation.","Every day I'd say I look different. Sometimes I look really formal, sometimes I love the classic Stella McCartney, Chloe Sevigny and Gwyneth Paltrow thing. Other days I like being rock star and wearing leather jackets and studs. I love wearing Burberry - it's the perfect combination of formal and punky.","I feel like my figure is a challenge because I'm quite flat chested but I've got a booty so I've got to look for the right things.","I've learned not to let it be the end of the world if a boy doesn't like you. I used to put so much effort into boys. I started playing guitar because I wanted to impress this boy. Then, I ended up in love with guitar and I didn't care about the boy anymore.","I maintain that when I finally retire from my career in music, I will go and live back in Wales - when I am an old person, if I live to be an old person. The water I miss, and the air, there's something different about it. And I miss the simple life.","Gwen Stefani has amazing style. I used to really love Courtney Love, and anything she wore I loved. Or Chloe Sevigny, because I really love that sort of classic look, and I like being girly and flowery, and wearing little D&G dresses. I wear hats a lot, too. I think it goes back to when I was a bit grungy and was a skater girl for a bit.","Even when I'm in quite a happy state of mind, I like writing really sad songs. I think a lot of people do.","It's usually a big kind of vent of frustration or anger or sadness that puts me in the right frame of mind to write. It's such a cliche to say that artists write when they're down, but it's true for me. It's a relief to get out what's eating away at my heart or my soul or my head.","I never remember having a plan. All I could think about was how I was going to afford to get into college or where I was going to stay because I hated being at home. I didn't really have time to think about anything in the future. I didn't think about a career or anything. I went to uni, got a couple of jobs, so I sort of funded it myself.","My favourite people to follow on Twitter are... my fans. They make me laugh so much and keep me smiling.","I love pink - pink's my favourite. I hardly ever - weirdly - wear it, but I love the colour pink.","'I Know You Care' is really personal and fragile for me. For me, it's about losing a family member and also about a breakup. It's about this idea of losing someone for good.","I got a random tattoo the other day. It's a red triangle, which makes everyone think I'm arty, which I'm not. I used to draw red triangles all the time. It must mean something - maybe I don't know it yet. But I'll figure it out.","I think all the covers I do have nice sentiments, particularly 'Your Song.' People write me very sweet messages about that song, though I'm sure there are people out there saying that I've ruined it too!","Two things I'm obsessed with are the countryside and fields and being in the open space and body parts, so you'll hear me mentioning body parts and human anatomy. I've listened to my songs and I think I am quite visual and I talk about bones and flesh a lot.","What people don't understand is that how you are as an artist depends on how you are emotionally.","I wrote 'Lights' a long, long time ago. And I expected it to be on the album, because it was - I wrote it with 'Biff' Stannard. And he wrote every single Spice Girls song and every single pop song of the 90s, basically. So I thought, you know, I was really lucky to work with him, but I didn't think it would be a big song for some reason.","Ever since I've been young I've been fascinated by the human body. I've written songs about it, but you can become quite morbid if you think about it too much - paranoid and a hypochondriac.","I'd call what I do pop music, but it's folky and electronic and it doesn't really sound like much else.","My fancy dress costume of choice is... something 1920s or 30s, when there was still so much elegance and attention to detail. An excuse for ultimate dressing-up indulgence.","As a kid I'd lie awake at night and convince myself that a meteor was about to hit the Earth. It's my fatalistic streak, which I've inherited from my mum. I firmly believe something cataclysmic is going to happen in my lifetime and I have to be prepared to run for my life when the time comes.","I never thought that I could make a living out of my voice, to be completely honest. I thought that I could probably keep playing pubs. And it was exciting for me to get even just a pub gig in my town or country, when I went to university.","'I Know You Care' is about my dad. And I haven't seen him for a long, long time. And my parents divorced when I was really young. And I guess I just wanted a - it was my way of saying that I wasn't bitter or angry anymore. I was just sad and just felt like something was missing.","You should constantly write because your writing is always evolving and progressing. It's really important to start writing young.","I feel like I write songs for the future or something. Not in an arrogant way, but I feel like maybe my songs were, like, before their time or something.","When I sing along with Britney Spears I will sing in an American accent. But eventually I found my own voice. My songs are so brutally honest, it would be alien to sing in any accent other than my own. Don't get me wrong - I can imitate singers. I can do bar mitzvahs and weddings.","I think hype is a good thing. You need it and it'll teach you valuable things and you'll grow stronger, which is what I've done.","The only really safe thing to do is to write a diary of where you've been, what time you went to bed, what you ate. If I wrote honestly about everything I think it'd be a disaster. It would cause a lot of trouble.","There are so many things to think about when you make an album. Like, who am I trying to impress? Am I going to get respect, critical acclaim? Or am I going to sell lots of records?","I'm never happy with my face, my hair, I haven't really got any boobs and I'm not really that tall.","Christmas in L.A. is weird. There's no snow. It's not even cold.","Cover versions, that's my forte, that's all I ever used to do. When you play your own songs, it's quite scary, 'cause I'm quite honest and open, they can be very revealing. But covers, I don't have to think about, just get me up there!","I've watched and learnt from DJs and remixers and paid way more attention to how I want my voice to sound. Before, as long as it was loud and in tune it was fine. I've discovered the difference made by various microphones and effects, so each track has a different vocal sound, my voice is woven into everything and it's above everything.","I was a kind of angsty teenager and I would write diaries and write stuff down all the time. Sometimes I get to the level on stage where I'm singing and it feels heavy, but not always.","I would never create an image for myself; I'm not that clever.","Apparently I'm introspective... levelheaded... but at the same time, absolutely insane.","By the time I got writing 'Halcyon,' I was on a roll, and I realized I had so much to write about, I realized I had so much built up inside that I couldn't really alleviate before, and then all of a sudden it was like reservoir burst.","Well, on tour I eat terribly, so I balance that by running a lot. And then I started to run with my fans in certain cities. It sounds very nerdy and un-rock n' roll, but I like it. It's fun, and it's better than meeting fans in weird, awkward circumstances. So I take them running with me.","America saw me as a projection of me that I always wanted. That's why I love going to America so much. I feel like I started off in America exactly how I wanted to start everywhere.","My voice has been very, very produced, and very treated - but then, also, it hasn't.","The very first song I wrote was about a boy that I was obsessed with.","I just sing and write songs and wear what I want. It's quite a good job really. If I wanted to I suppose I could become more of a fashion icon, but singing is my thing.","I'm quite private. And I never wanted to be the biggest star in the world, really. So in that sense I've got a good balance of doing great shows, of making an appearance every now and then and writing music, and I don't really have to do much else.","If a hundred people want autographs, sometimes you have to say no because you've got to get up for a 4 A.M. flight or something. In that sense, it really pisses me off when people think you've become a diva. It's not becoming a diva, it's because of the situation, I think.","There are plenty of bands who never get in the charts and it doesn't mean that they're not any good. Actually, a lot of the top ten is filled with stuff that just sounds the same. I could guess what's in there now - probably a bit of GaGa, Beyonce and some U.S. R&B males.","The nature of how we are as human beings is that we're much more interested in being critical rather than praising something.","I keep getting compared to Marina and the Diamonds because she's kind of in the same place as me at the moment. It's quite annoying being compared, actually, because it almost downgrades your work and makes you feel like you're just another female artist.","Not much shocked me. You know, I worked in a home for Alzheimer's patients and my dad used to be really into murders and stuff, so I saw dead bodies. It desensitised me to a lot of things.","I'm a bit of a like girly-girl, really, I like flowery stuff.","I used to be obsessed with Pearl Jam, but I love having pink hair and kind of looking like a Barbie.","I love designer stuff but like it will only be like, on a whim. I love Alexander Wang so much, but it's expensive.","My hairdresser in the U.K., Adam Reed, has his own line, Percy and Reed, and it's really good. And I use Moroccan Oil and Kerastase as well.","I never thought I'd say the sentence 'It was a real honour' - because that implies that you've done something pretty special. But now I've done that several times. Yesterday I was in Buckingham Palace - I actually met the Queen yesterday and that was an honour. I never thought I'd do something like that.","Drake, I'd like to collaborate with. He's a phenomenal lyricist. Probably the best rapper in the world at the moment. I love Kanye but there's something about Drake; he's more straight up, really clever and really poetic and metaphorical - I love that. He's just clever.","Bjork, I'd love to do something with her. I'd love to do some sort of crazy orchestral choir thing with her.","I've got a song called 'Salt Skin' because when you run in the heat it evaporates and you've got salt crystals on your face. I love that, because it means you've worked really hard.","I'm not afraid, as a writer, of being emotional. I'm obsessed with human emotion, body parts, physicality.","My mum was too busy raising four of us to encourage my hopes. But I'm glad I had the upbringing I did. It made me a worrier and a thoughtful, curious person.","People always try to find my agenda, but I don't really have one. It's safe to say that I make pop, but I think that I'm doing important music, too. I've just always done what I wanted to do.","I can fall in love in a simple way, but I can dissect it in such an intense fashion when it ends.","I'd like to look like Madonna when I'm her age. I also look at athletes and love their bodies. I've always wanted to be muscly, not skinny. A lot of women yo-yo around, but I'm always aware if I'm getting a bit out of shape. I never look at the scales but I can just tell. It goes on my tum and bum.","The only day I remember of my parents' marriage was the day my dad walked out. As I stood there at five years old, with my older sister and younger brother, I knew that he was gone.","I love prints of skulls and bones and have some taxidermy - a crow and a rabbit - to remind me of home. I like art and have a big portrait of Bjork.","I don't think there was ever a moment when I was like, 'Yeah, I want to be a singer!' I guess it just happened. I performed a lot when I was younger and stuff, but I remember getting to the point where I thought I might have to get a normal job.","Since I met Starsmith, my producer, I really feel like I'm making music because we write it together and produce it together. I've got a proper involvement in the end product as opposed to just writing a song and finding someone else to produce it.","I record stuff all the time, like little vocal things. I write random things down... Sometimes I just get things stuck in my head and I record them, and that actually becomes a song quite a lot of the time.","I find male singers and what they sing about fascinating. It makes me realize how little we know about ourselves and how little I know about myself. It's interesting to see the male perspective.","I'd like a male to listen to my music and find it kind of fascinating, what a girl goes through when they get heartbroken or get sad or get hurt by something.","When I heard Bjork's debut, that was when I first realized that I could be a singer, even with my unusual voice.","Lauryn Hill is quite political and is very bold and isn't afraid of wearing her heart on her sleeve, and same with Bjork, except she is a little bit more kind of fragile.","I'm really proud of 'Bright Lights' because I was still in the mind frame of my first album when I was putting it together, but next time I want to display something different. I don't want to be as young, immature and all about boys!","You get to a certain age and you can't judge yourself on your dad or your parents.","I suffer panic attacks which has made me really conscious about my fitness and I have become addicted to jogging. It might sound odd but a lot of good has come out of it. My fans send letters saying they have taken up jogging because I do it.","I could always sing, from a really young age, but my voice was really weird. I used to make my mum turn up the radio every day in our house. She was well into music so I got that from her.","I couldn't really relate much to my younger sister, because she was born in 1992, and I was born in 1986. And then my older sister, we just didn't get on that much. Although we bonded over hating our stepdad.","I was the first person to go to university from my family.","I'd hate it to become style over substance, I'd hate people to start putting me in a magazine article about my style. I don't like dressing up in something I'm not necessarily comfortable in just to make it more of a show. I want the power to come from what I sing about and how I sing.","I guess I started running when I was about 18 and... I feel like it assists my creativity a bit because it completely just flushes everything out.","My guiltiest pleasure is... chocolates with strawberry cream and trashy television - 'Geordie Shore,' 'Katie,' etc.","One of the most powerful feelings in the world is after a really, really long run.","I've always said that Adele has turned so many people on to British singers - whether female singers or just like music from this country in general.","Mumford & Sons' music appeals to a lot of America. I'm really proud of them.","Because I've always been a runner I love to feel that my body is shining on the inside. I wear baggy clothes, so it's not as though I like showing it off. I just like to know I'm great on the inside.","Men are wary of me because they know, by listening to my music, that a relationship with me will be quite deep.","I still don't know if I can write songs. I don't think anyone ever knows if they can write songs.","I've changed the way I look a bit but not intentionally. I've cut my hair. I've got a bit of pink in it and lately I've become a bit monochrome, wearing a lot of black and white.","I instinctively dress a bit tougher because I've spent a lot of time in the U.S. and I realised there was a certain image projected of me here. I've always been an absolute rebel. When I was in my teen years I had piercings and wore all black.","I hadn't even released my first proper single when I started to feel the strain of attention. But I don't believe that it was the attention that was giving me panic attacks. I think it was everything in my life colliding at the same time. It really did get to a serious point where I couldn't even walk down the street without getting the pain.","You pick up loads of baggage with your first record with reaction to it from fans and critics. So I went to Ireland by myself for a couple of weeks with my guitar. I read lots of poetry, I read Patti Smith's autobiography and started words and phrases and then songs started to take shape.","I still love the skinny jeans thing and I wear my favorite leather jacket constantly. I like being kind of a rock star. I love that I can feel comfortable in a small dress or I can feel comfortable wearing a baggy T-shirt.","After shows my face feels dirty with makeup and sweat, especially in the smaller venues, so it feels good to get back to the bus and smooth it away. Sometimes you need something alcohol-based, especially on tour when you don't always get a chance to keep washing your face all the time.","It's so important to take vitamins. People always get ill on tour because of the close proximity in the bus with everyone.","Breakups just hit you harder when you're younger. When I was a teenager, it felt like the most depressing thing in the world if a boy I was infatuated with didn't like me back!","I'm a bit grungy - I love wearing boots. But I also love putting on a beautiful white dress and jewels. I have those two alter-egos.","I don't really have a style icon but I really admire the way people dress like Gaga, Rihanna and Gwen Stefani. It's good to be inspired by singers who write music and dress incredibly - rather than models and people in the fashion industry who dress immaculately anyway because it's their style.","Now, if some panic hits me, you have to sort of be friends with your body, it's like your body will work against you.","I've always been fascinated by the human body, but you can become quite morbid and paranoid if you think too much.","I played recorder in assembly, then I became passionate about the guitar, I don't know why. I started on electric then moved to acoustic - my brother was playing bass in the next room.","I met Prince William at a musical festival and he let me know he was a fan of my music. But the invitation to sing at his wedding reception came completely out of the blue. The fact that Kate and William knew the words to my songs was very touching.","I started getting these attacks in 2009, just as my music career was taking off. I'd be doing photo-shoots and started to feel like I was having heart attacks. Increasingly I found it difficult to step outside my flat. Things started to get better after I saw a therapist, who told me I needed to make peace with my panic attacks.","I never expected to get the Tom Jones treatment and it amazes me that I do. Strangely it's women who throw their underwear at me when I'm performing live. My male fans tend to be quite shy. My female fans are wild. I never know what to do with all the lingerie that lands at my feet. Maybe I should open a shop.","I was quite a weird kid because I didn't like getting presents. I don't know why. I just went for books all the time.","I start really missing London when I go away. I have a little flat, but very central. I live above a pub and you'd think it'd be a nightmare, but I like hearing the music and it's quite comforting.","It took time to really build myself a reputation as a good live performer, a musician and an artist.","Maybe one day I'll make a record that's really mysterious and no one knows where it came from or what I wrote it about. But thus far, I've just wanted to explain everything properly.","I used to make my manager Jamie not tell me where I was going to be the next day, because I was so afraid of flying and of anything. But now I love flying, I love working hard, I love being around the world.","I got approached by SoBe a few months ago about being an ambassador and I learned about the previous ones including Naomi Campbell, so I was instantly interested! Then I tried and really liked it. It's different and has interesting flavours... we don't have anything like it in the U.K."],"Ellie Kemper":["A man's face is not a rich person's lawn; you are wasting resources if you devote that much energy to trimming your beard, sideburns, or mustache just so. Nor is a man's face the woods; there need not be the tangled weeds, shrubbery, and wildlife/eggs benedict that get ensnared in them.","I think New Yorkers are some of the friendliest people in the world, but it just comes out in a different way. In a way where they're swearing at you.","I love, love, love, love, love, love Naeem Khan. Every dress he makes looks like it belongs in a museum. You put it on, and you feel like royalty.","If you're going to plan a wedding, then a certain amount of suffering is not a choice.","If you're tired, you shouldn't make yourself exercise. Take a nap instead. It's about getting an appropriate amount of work and rest. I get very crabby if I'm not well-rested.","Yes, some women are funny. No, some women aren't funny. It's similar to how some women are tall and, you know, some women are short.","If I'm alone, I tend to cook for myself. I do a pretty good job of preparing healthful foods. My go-to is everything in a bowl like quinoa, avocado. Later in the day, scrambled eggs. I'm not a gourmet chef. I cook in bulk very well.","I think, regardless of gender, women and men need to be brave, take chances with their work, and be open to feedback. But I do think 'politeness' is an issue that can hinder your work if you aren't careful. Kindness is important, but being overly polite - thinking you can't disagree with someone about your own work - be careful about that.","I wrote comedy sketches in college.","New York is like the weirdest city in the United States, in a great way, and Los Angeles is probably more similar to most of America.","I need to make sure that when I'm running out to the drugstore I'm not wearing a Biore strip or something. Not that I expect anyone to recognize me, but on the off chance they do, I just don't want to embarrass myself.","I can't do impressions.","I want to be a morning-talk-show host. I love Kelly Ripa's job. She gets to live in New York and has this amazing job hosting a talk show.","My painting teacher in high school used to say, 'I can't paint like I want to, but through practice I'll get better.' But I don't think that's true. I think sometimes you just can't paint.","I loved 'Freaks and Geeks.' I don't know a better show.","I've never had prejudice against me because of being a woman in comedy, I've never felt any sort of unfairness because of that - but I do think it is naive to think that it doesn't exist.","It's interesting because with a lot of people who I've met in comedy, it seems not to matter what your background is. In terms of formal schooling - I feel like that's a nineteenth century term - but in terms of where you went to high school or college, or wherever, all that really is irrelevant, I have found, in comedy.","Improv is mostly what I've studied.","I think I get certain pleasure from writing what I'm performing.","Growing up, I had one very specific idea of what a wedding should be, and that was the wedding of Fraulein Maria and Captain von Trapp in 'The Sound of Music.'","I guess it's easier to think badly and then be pleasantly surprised.","One nice thing that I have discovered about Los Angeles is the enthusiasm with which people dress.","Most New Yorkers want to look amazing, and they want you to understand that they look amazing, but they also want you to stop staring at them.","In Los Angeles, people dress with the deep and earnest hope that people will do nothing but stare at them.","Los Angeles survives on that which is unpredictable. The unexpected courses through its very veins.","When you start feeling the baby kick, you realize there's a person inside, and that pregnancy is very different from having a person you're responsible for for the rest of your life. I don't know what I'm doing, but then I have to remind myself no parent does, right?","I joined an improv comedy group. Ours was named 'Quick Fire!' with an exclamation point. It was when I auditioned for that team and got on it and felt like... I'll just say I felt like I was good at it.","Men, who certainly possess not only the savvy but also the know-how to be funny, for some reason, are just not. I began to notice this at a pretty young age, and unfortunately, a lifetime of living - and not a little bit of regret - hasn't done much to convince me otherwise.","There are some extremely acceptable male comedians out there: Joel Osteen, Abraham Lincoln, the man who played Phil Spector in HBO's 'Phil Spector.' But even those guys, while insightful and amusing, aren't exactly funny.","In the back of my head, I always thought it would be great to become an actress on a sitcom.","A lot of people ask, 'What's the best advice Tina Fey's given you?' But she doesn't, like, go about doling out advice - like, 'I've got another tip for you!'","I have given myself dork shivers so many times that I would be an outright liar if I characterized myself as anything other than a pure, utter, and unadulterated dork.","I have found I'm leaning toward more vibrant colors because I'm so happy in them.","I have very sensitive skin, and so, whenever I can, I want to give it a rest. I'm, like, the moisturizing queen.","I'm a little disappointed in myself because before getting pregnant, I resolved to do all these things during my pregnancy to nurse a healthy pregnancy. And so I'm finding in these final weeks that I didn't do any of them.","If I don't do some sort of exercise in a day, I do get in a terrible mood. That's always been true.","I always have ice cream in the house. I have a bowl of it, and then a bit more. One of the greatest pleasures in my life is going back and getting a second half-bowl. The first bowl is just the prelude.","I'm a morning bird. I love getting up before it's light out if it's possible. I wake up, I have a black coffee. I'm an 86-year-old man. I try to work out first thing to get it over with. When I do it, I feel good because I have the endorphins all day.","I look forward to physical activity; it's a release from stress and a nice distraction. It puts me in a better mood. I never used to take classes before, but then I tore my plantar fascia so I couldn't run. I started taking SoulCycle classes, which I know are polarizing. People have strong opinions. Even though I can run again, I still go.","Growing up, I had one very specific idea of what a wedding should be, and that was the wedding of Fraeulein Maria and Captain von Trapp in 'The Sound of Music.'","It took two months from the day my fiance proposed to my first Google search for 'wedding planning: how?' Now, let me interrupt myself here and share how much I hate using the word 'fiance.' It's so fancy, and it's hard not to sound like a jerk saying it. Which is why I will be using my own word for fiance: gloob.","I am fully anticipating that something - perhaps many things - will not go according to plan on our actual wedding day. If some of the flowers are wilted, or there aren't enough vegetarian meals, or the priest calls me the wrong name, I will embrace these errors.","I've participated in the Nautica Malibu Triathlon a couple of times, but only in the running portion.","For a few months, I'd have a green juice every day, but one day, I realized I'd rather eat those ingredients than drink them.","What's shocking to me is seeing people walking around with green juices in their hand when the weather's bad in New York. I couldn't think of anything more awful to have when it's sleeting outside. Like, 'Oh, I'm craving some liquified kale right now.'","I love coffee, but I have to make sure I don't have more than one cup a day because I'm already a little hyper.","I like healthful foods, but I'm from the Midwest, so I like food that's been around longer.","I love running. I've been running ever since middle school. In terms of clearing your head and restarting everything, I love running.","'Kimmy' first and foremost is a show about a woman overcoming the odds. I think that they write the show in a way that you're not beaten over the head with it, but showing and not telling. I think that's really powerful.","The weekend after 'Kimmy' started streaming on Netflix, I did notice a definite difference in people on the street recognizing you. I think that's such a strange thing to happen. It's like, you asked for it, you went and put yourself in the public eye, so don't be surprised people recognize you, but that part can be strange.","I'm not on social media because I feel like that would be just such another level of responsibility that I don't feel up to. It's not uncommon now to have personal and public intertwined, and I don't know how people are able to manage that. I don't know where you go when you want to be alone if everything is out there."],"Ellie Kendrick":["There's no point starting something you don't intend to finish.","I never thought I'd be right to play a Juliet-like character.","In an ideal world, I'd like to carry on acting, but I don't want it to interfere with my studies.","I was really attracted to doing 'Game of Thrones' because I thought the character of Meera was absolutely amazing.","It was fantastic returning to 'Being Human'. When I got cast in the role, at first I just thought it was for one episode, and the fans were really great about it, and it was really nice having that reaction.","Everyone loves a slice of period-drama-pie, but I think the success of 'Upstairs Downstairs' is really down to the wonderful format that Jean Marsh and Eileen Atkins created.","My parents are big Shakespeare fans.","I'd been going up for things, but I hadn't got anything, and then 'Anne Frank' came out, and there was a sudden flurry. I got a call saying they wanted to see me at the Globe, which was incredible because I'd been coming here since I was 12."],"Elliot Ackerman":["I tried to render the Afghan war as much as I could fro the perspective of the Afghans. I have served as an advisor to Afghan troops, and much of my war experience was seen through the lens of fighting that war alongside Afghan soldiers.","In media coverage of the war, Afghans are often characterized as corrupt and deceitful. There has certainly been plenty of corruption and deceit in this conflict, but why? What inspires these behaviors? In 'Green on Blue,' I wanted to render a world that is often overlooked: that of the average Afghans who are helping America wage its war.","Literature has always been a part of my life. I studied history and literature in college. My mother is a novelist; I grew up around books.","The creation is a very internal process, and publishing the book is a very external process. It is nice to see the book out in the world and people having the same reaction as when I created it. The point of all art is the emotional transference, and when that happens, the book has succeeded.","Whether your mother is a novelist like mine or a third-generation military wife, the idea of a son or daughter being in mortal danger is terrifying.","There are these moments in the military where you're present at these enormous intersections of history and humanity. I came out of the end of that, and I just wanted to write. If you do it well, you know it will last. It can't get blown away like everything else.","Wars have economies. And I don't mean financial economies, although that's often part of it. Why do people continue fighting these wars? There are financial incentives.","My war buddies, some were Americans, but some were Afghans. These were the guys that I fought alongside. We bled alongside each other; we mourned together. When I came home, these weren't people I could keep up with on Facebook.","All art to me is an empathetic act. Whoever's telling a story is trying to transfer emotion into someone else.","When you go to war, it's important for everybody to know that they're going to come home in one way or other."],"Elliot Cowan":["I do revel slightly in the fact that I am what I am - an English, middle-class, public-school-educated bloke. There is a reputation with that of being slightly stiff, but whoever gets to know me will see some other element - whether it be vulnerable or silly or camp.","I didn't want to get into acting just to play bystanders. I feel a bystander enough in my own life. And I do think that theatre can contribute to a certain analysis and commentary on our own world.","As I get older, the more I don't want my life to be emotionally out of balance in the way it was in my twenties.","I've not been distracted by a long-running TV show or visits to America for pilot season.","I'm still very much about being an actor. That's why I'm not married with kids.","Even though momentarily I thought about being a doctor, I was always involved in theatre and did a drama degree. I just didn't have the guts to go, 'Yes, I'm going to be an actor,' until I was probably 21.","I've done some bits of shockingly bad TV that have never been shown, or at least I hope they've never been shown... Please don't dig them out!","At a party in L.A., I met this middle-aged gentleman who I was talking to for ages when I asked, 'So, what do you do?' Turns out I was speaking to legendary music producer Quincy Jones, who worked on Michael Jackson's hits. And there was little old me rattling on - I was so embarrassed.","What we consider typical of the male is a question I ask myself quite often - it's relevant to my life as an actor and as a man.","Characters in TV and theatre tend to experience a lot of conflict, so I push myself through sport to physical and emotional levels that hurt so I've some other reference for extreme experience that isn't me shouting at my girlfriend or my mum. It's a way of controlling the uncontrollable."],"Elliot Knight":["We can all tend to get caught up in the complications of life that we create; we live life for other people. It's a harrowing moment when you're confronted with an end, and you have to make the choice to live your life for you.","I was the kid who was sat in his room, trying to move objects across the room with my eyes or my mind.","I definitely love when things get gritty and they get a bit dirty!","The only thing that made its way to actually happen for me was acting. I love it, and I love being on set. I love being in rehearsal for things and telling stories. It's what I feel I am supposed to be doing.","I love music, and I love sports. I played sports all throughout school.","I did three years training for stage in drama school.","You are alive, but you should enjoy that while you can. I try to keep that same life philosophy of just enjoying the moments that come my way and not be the one that gets in my own way from making the most of the opportunities that I have.","Even though you can have a youthful energy, it doesn't mean that you can't know a lot and bring a lot to the situation.","I think people get confused about who Merlin is. It's not his age that makes him: it's wisdom, and wisdom is not necessarily linked to age. Definitely not in the same way in the world of 'Once Upon a Time.'","I'd had four auditions for 'Sinbad' when I got the phone call. I was in the Trafford Centre in Manchester, and I screamed very loudly. Then I ran outside, and I screamed some more.","It was like my part-time job as a kid to be an adventurer... in my head. I used to sword-fight in the garden and in the park - with my Nan, of all people, with my Nan who can barely walk! I used to make her run around, and I'd go around destroying these trees and cones and stuff.","I think there are always times when people want to get out of reality, because sometimes it sucks and it's difficult.","It's very important not just to think you need to eat and drink and sleep. You need to feed your heart and your mind and your soul as well.","Sinbad is a great character for any actor to be able to play: impulsive, adventurous, passionate, loyal, and brave - a true hero.","In Malta, it's so hot, you wouldn't believe.","It's a very strange situation to be in when you have pictures of you topless everywhere and people thrusting them in your face all time.","'By Any Means' follows a team of behind-the-scenes crime-prevention team - not police. They basically go to the areas of crime where the police can't touch and organised crime fighting units can't go to - in the public eye - to bring about real justice, treading the line between 'true' justice and what the law says is justice.","I've always received a lot of support from my family, particularly for my pursuits as an actor. I'm very lucky.","Fairy tales were great because they provided a no-limits playground for my imagination, and growing up, there's nothing more exciting.","A role I grew up with and always loved was James Bond. I'd even say, in some ways, that he served as a creative role model for me as a kid in terms of roles I would want to play. I watched all of the movies growing up with my dad, so to be Bond himself would, without a doubt, be my dream role.","My parents made every effort to encourage me to pursue anything in life that I enjoyed or found appealing so that I would be able to better understand myself and my passions as I grew up.","I consider everyone a hero, to be honest.","I used to watch 'Charmed' and 'The Secret World of Alex Mack' - she was the best.","Everyone's been so great, and the fandom is so huge and passionate and dedicated. It really is great to feel so supported.","I've always loved magic.","Merlin is, in the terms of the world of magic, one of the most intriguing and powerful characters.","I love the story of Quasimodo, about someone who feels like they don't belong but is pure of heart and has good intentions. It's a great message for a younger audience.","After we finished filming 'Sinbad,' I went out to Los Angeles for meetings and was invited to a pre-Oscars party. I met Victoria Beckham, Kenneth Branagh, and Gary Oldman. That was quite a leap for me.","It's important to keep yourself grounded, and my friends and family make sure of that.","I look completely different from how I did in 'Sinbad,' and it's nice to be myself."],"Elliot Perlman":["As my name might suggest, I'm Jewish. My grandparents were Polish and Russian Jews who came to Australia in the late 1920s, and had they not, we wouldn't be talking now.","I'm a Taurus, which sounds like the name of a pickup truck. I'd prefer to be born under the sign of the rock wallaby. If you're going to interpret your life pursuant to an utterly irrational dogma, why can't it have a cute mascot? Rock wallabies really are fabulous animals, and in any remotely just world, they would have their own star sign.","Combine a left-leaning upbringing with a family with direct experience of the Holocaust and someone with aspirations to write and I guess, sooner or later, that person will have a stab at writing something about the Holocaust.","I like dialogue in novels. I wanted to avoid laying history on with a trowel - appearing to be lecturing, as opposed to the characters lecturing their children or students. Dialogue can humanise the story and make it go down somewhat more smoothly.","Being an insomniac only slows me down. I try not to write at night, as I'm concerned that this will affect the quality.","I can't really remember a time in my life when I didn't know something about what we call the Holocaust. It was this dark topic that I would know more about when I got older, but which was spoken about in hushed tones.","I know that at literary festivals I'm speaking mostly to middle-class women, who frequently vote in a way that is contrary to how I'd like them to vote.","Being an insomniac only slows me down. I try not to write at night, as I'm concerned that this will affect the quality. I might have a Scotch to keep me going, but I like to be as awake and as alert as possible.","In my work, I'm always trying not to put barriers up between the 'good poor' and the 'bad poor.' I'm not sure my work will change things much, but at the very least, you want to make people feel that they are not alone.","I'll be happy if I can gain even the smallest place inside the literary imagination of U.S. readers.","After a while, if you're a writer, you want to start appearing in the bookstores of the place you're living in."],"Elliot Richardson":["If there are flaws they are in ourselves, and our task therefore must be one not of redesign but of renewal and reaffirmation, especially of the standards in which all of us believe.","People have moved beyond apathy, beyond skepticism into deep cynicism.","It often seemed like we had become a nation where the only heroes were rock singers and ball players and that there were no large men of probity who could be called upon for the task.","The Watergate reforms did work well for many years, and if improved and broadened, these reforms can have real and major impact on the system today.","The vice president had a bargaining asset, however, that no ordinary person has: He was next in line to the presidency. I saw no chance that he would resign first, then take his chances on trial, conviction, and jail.","There is an increasingly pervasive sense not only of failure, but of futility. The legislative process has become a cruel shell game and the service system has become a bureaucratic maze, inefficient, incomprehensible, and inaccessible.","But tending machinery was one thing; defining what we were trying to do and why we were doing it, and developing ways to measure how well the job was done - this was something else again.","For you, the state is an entity with purposes of its own that the people can be required to serve. For us the word is only a label for the arrangements by which we the people delegate to some among us responsibility for things that concern us in common.","I had come to regard the U.S. Senate's rejection of the League of Nations as a tragic mistake.","I hope you will respond to the crisis of confidence that Watergate has created by opening up your administration and reaching out to people in a more magnanimous spirit.","I said the first concern of the administration of justice must, of course, be the individual. The second concern is the truth.","I thought I was going to be killed. The casualties were so heavy, it was just a given. I learned to take each day, each mission, as it came. That's an attitude I've carried into my professional life. I take each case, each job, as it comes.","If the large power voluntarily abstains from using its full power or feels the strategic situation to be such that it cannot do so, it in effect loses the advantage of being a big power.","Mr. President, I believe your real problem is that you have somehow been unable to realize that you have won, not only won, but been re-elected by a tremendous margin.","My most important task must be an attempt to bring the monster under democratic direction and control.","The experience of learning how to get straight to the core of a problem proved to be of immense value later when I had a long succession of responsibilities in large, complex government departments.","The idea of being in the State Department was exciting. On the other hand, I always had in the back of my mind going into politics. If I stayed in Washington, I might end up a government hack.","They've got him - credible witnesses, documents, heaven knows what else. In all my years as a prosecutor I have never seen such an open-and-shut case.","Though every legal task demands this skill, it is especially important in the effort to frame public policy in a way that is properly responsive to human needs and predicaments. The question is always: How will the general rule work in practice?"],"Elliott Abrams":["First impressions matter. Experts say we size up new people in somewhere between 30 seconds and two minutes.","Elections matter, but how much they matter depends entirely on how free, open and fair they are.","In Jordan, where the prime minister is always a commoner, the king has announced some new reforms that would tend to move the country toward a more democratic system: Notably, the prime minister would emerge from the victorious political party, not from back room conversations in the royal palace.","The war on drugs is not being won, and it continues to threaten stability and democracy not only in the Andes but throughout the Caribbean as well, where tiny police and military forces are outclassed by the sophisticated equipment in the hands of traffickers passing through the region on the way to their market in this country.","The courage of the Syrian protesters is remarkable, for they face prison, torture, or death every time they lift a banner.","The notion that public service requires men and women of good character now seems quaint.","During the election campaign of 2000, it was generally thought that then-governor Bush didn't know much about foreign policy or national security affairs, and that Colin Powell would lead on that front, while the president's main concern would be domestic.","Persecution of Christians is growing around the world, and Congress needs to pay more attention to it.","Fatah is a political party and movement, whose chairman is Mahmoud Abbas.","For many societies, the journey to modernity has been painful and costly.","In critical ways, Obama has reversed not just Bush policy but every president's approach to the world since the Second World War, save for that of his soulmate Jimmy Carter.","In Iran, there is no freedom of the press, no freedom of speech, no independent judiciary, no free elections. There is no freedom of religion - not even for Shiites, who are forced by Iran's theocracy to adhere to one narrow set of official rules.","In Arab capitals, the failure of the United States to stop Iran's nuclear program is understood as American weakness in the struggle for dominance in the Middle East, making additional cooperation from Arab leaders on Israeli-Palestinian issues even less likely.","I would have thought that if you're going to try to punish the Syrians and prevent them from using chemical weapons again, the thing to do is a one-time strike. Maybe a cruise missile strike at one or two of their air bases just so they know what they're going to gain from using chemical weapons on the battlefield.","On the human rights side, administration policy has been marked by indifference. When the people of Iran flooded the streets to protest the theft of their presidential election in June 2009, President Obama was silent for 11 days.","Nineteen-seventy-nine had been a year of American setbacks around the globe. Before the year began, Cuban troops were already roaming Angola, and a pro-Communist regime ruled Ethiopia.","Enlightened despots are mythical creatures; real despots seem more interested in stealing money or installing their sons after them.","Dubai must crack down on rampant smuggling, and the U.A.E. federal government has significantly stepped up pressure.","One good way of measuring the mood in Israel is just how alert or relaxed the guards at every restaurant entrance appear to be.","Terrorism exploded after the Camp David talks broke down in 2000 because the Palestinians' leader at the time, Yasser Arafat, supported it.","Al Qaeda's message that violence, terrorism and extremism are the only answer for Arabs seeking dignity and hope is being rejected each day in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, Syria, Yemen, Bahrain and throughout the Arab lands.","The Arab monarchies, especially Jordan and Morocco, are more legitimate than the false republics, with their stolen elections, regime-dominated courts and rubber-stamp parliaments.","There isn't any way for the people of Nicaragua to find out what's going on in Nicaragua.","Now in its third year in office, the Obama Administration has never championed the cause of human rights. Its slow reaction in June 2009 to the stealing of the election in Iran and the birth of the 'Green Movement' there, and its delay in backing the rebellions in Egypt, Libya, and Syria, are evidence of this problem.","We need to understand that an open society and free speech and press... really are the best weapons against al Qaeda and extremism.","The question was never whether the United States, E.U., NATO, Arab League, U.N. Security Council, and African Union could together using economic sanctions, diplomatic pressure, and military attacks to bring Qaddafi down. The question was always how much time, how much blood, and what damage to NATO.","The good Jew is ritually observant and resists assimilation, in some sense living apart, never fitting comfortably into American or any other society.","When the policy is controversial, you have to go out and defend it.","The conflict between secular Zionism and the settler movement did not appear overnight following Israel's conquests in the 1967 war, for there was an argument that bridged the gap: security.","Palestine, as Icelanders see it, includes the Western Wall of the Second Temple, Judaism's holiest site.","The Fayyad cabinet may well be the best the Palestinians ever get. But whatever its good qualities, there is no democracy.","Israel's flexibility is dependent on its sense of security.","Honduras was the original 'banana republic,' and its poverty remains extreme.","Bahai Iranians are barred from holding government jobs, their children are excluded from the nation's university system, their marriages are not recognized and their cemeteries and holy places have been desecrated. It is government policy to incite hatred of Bahais in the official media.","While all Alawites fear vengeance against their entire community should Assad fall, there are varying degrees of loyalty to the Assads.","The fake republics are goners; the monarchies have a fighting chance. That's my conclusion after a short visit to the Middle East and discussions with officials and analysts there.","For decades, the Arab states have seemed exceptions to the laws of politics and human nature. While liberty expanded in many parts of the globe, these nations were left behind, their 'freedom deficit' signaling the political underdevelopment that accompanied many other economic and social maladies.","U.S.-Israel relations are often depicted as an extended honeymoon, but that's a false image.","The accession to power in Pyongyang of Kim Jong Un, son of Kim Jong Il and grandson of Kim Il Sung, is a unique achievement in world politics.","Israel will not and should not leave until it is clear that the West Bank can be policed by Palestinians and that the region will not be a source of terrorism against Israel, as Gaza and South Lebanon became when Israel left there.","Being an Arab leader has its rewards: the suite at the Waldorf-Astoria during the United Nations General Assembly, travel in your own plane, plenty of cash, even job security - whether kings, sheiks or presidents, with or without elections, most serve for life.","I never said I had no idea about most of the things you said I said I had no idea about.","In 2004, President Bush gave Prime Minister Sharon certain guarantees about American policy, but the Obama administration treated those as a kind of private letter having no binding policy impact.","Sometimes the results of a first free election will find the moderates so poorly organized that extreme groups can eke out a victory, as Hamas did when it gained a 44-to-41 percent margin in the Palestinian election of 2006.","It seems clear to me that the Obama Administration has no human rights policy. That is, while in some inchoate sense they would like respect for human rights to grow around the world, as all Americans would, they have no actual policy to achieve that goal - and they subordinate it to all their other policy goals.","America was not founded to improve health care or housing; it was founded for freedom.","Two presidents pursued human rights policies that were serious and effective: Reagan and George W. Bush. They understood that American support for human rights activists is a moral imperative for us and also makes the world safer for us.","It was simply impossible to support Carter for reelection in 1980 and easy for me to support Reagan. The Reagan campaign was happy to have Democratic support, and the Reagan administration was happy to have Democrats in it; they took the view that, after all, Reagan himself had been a Democrat, so it was not a strike against you.","I grew up in Queens, in New York City, in a middle class Jewish family. My mother was a public school teacher, my father was a lawyer. They were Democrats - kind of middle-of-the-road democrats.","When you work in the White House you talk to the White House staff all day, so you're talking to the guy who handles the congressional liaison and the guy who's handling domestic politics and the guy who's handling the American economy and so forth.","For the entire first term, Obama and his people blamed Bush for everything - which is another way of saying they felt Bush and the Bush years were the inescapable reference point for everything they were themselves doing.","Obama is like the kid brother whose only standard for judging his own achievements is the records his big brother set.","The Sandinistas are a tough bunch of guys, with a fabulous amount of Soviet Bloc equipment and Soviet Bloc advisers.","China has concluded that trade trumps all.","There's been an Israeli position, which is 'We love Mubarak,' that permeates their whole society, the political class. That certainly differs from many of us in the pro-Israel camp in the United States.","The real crime of Hosni Mubarak is that he ruled for 30 years and left behind an Egypt where the Muslim Brotherhood is the single strongest player.","I just don't understand how Kerry or Obama or anybody else thought Assad was going to change.","If you are trying to raise a child to be a Jew, then you have to create a sense of Jewish identity. You really weaken that sense of identity if you celebrate two religions.","You are not practicing Judaism if you celebrate Christmas.","The ultimate goal is to change Syria's behaviour on a variety of issues - on its interference in Lebanese internal affairs, on its support for Palestinian terrorist groups that oppose the Palestinian Authority, on, most importantly, acting as a land bridge between Iran and Hezbollah, where Hezbollah gets all its arms.","If you said to people you can cast a secret ballot on whether to turn back the clock and have Morsi in power again, I don't think very many people in Washington would turn back that clock.","Terrorists that kill Americans don't get released.","Libya as a country is a relatively new concept. The period of Libya as a modern nation really starts after World War II.","Both Bibi and Obama realize that they are going to have to face the problem of Iran together.","It is a natural goal of Iran to try and expel the Fifth Fleet from Bahrain.","I don't think a Palestinian state is going to be created at a conference table; it will be created on the ground in the West Bank, and some day, a peace conference will ratify that which has been built on the ground.","The Assad regime is quite reliant on oil exports.","If you say to the White House, 'Obama has been very unfriendly to Israel,' they say, 'What do you mean? It's the best military-to-military relationship ever.' And that part is true.","You can easily see why the experience of Jews would be helpful if you're looking to get action on religious persecution.","The Pope is not a political figure.","Senator Kerry was fooled by Bashar al-Assad.","At Guantanamo Bay, we could create a West Berlin, a free small city within the Communist nation that could trade freely with the U.S. and elect its own officials.","If a Jewish group sat down with a Christian conservative group, and there was a so-called Messianic Jew at the table, that would be the end of the meeting.","I personally would not talk to a Jew for Jesus.","The threat that Syria might transfer more advanced weapons to Hezbollah has existed for a long time.","The raids on Freedom House, the National Democratic Institute and International Republican Institute, the Adenauer Foundation, and other groups helping Egyptians move toward respect for democratic politics and human rights were of a piece with the practices of Hosni Mubarak - only bolder and more repressive.","The Egyptian military plays positive and negative roles in Egypt, but the most significant single thing it did under Mubarak was to guarantee an Islamist victory once he left the scene.","We use American influence with Israel not to promote economic growth in the West Bank, but to try and impede Jewish - never Arab - construction in the capital city.","The mishandling of the would-be airplane bomber Umar Farouk Abdul Mutallab's visa is only the latest piece of evidence that the granting of visas should be taken away from the State Department. For the granting of visas - especially today, when terrorism is such a complex threat - is far closer to being a law-enforcement function.","The United States needs to be far clearer: we cannot and will not support any government where Hamas has a real influence and the security forces stop fighting terror.","The intersection of religion and world politics has often been a bloody crossroads.","I well remember a leading Egyptian liberal saying to me in 2003 that she did not favor free elections right then in Egypt; she favored them in a decade's time if she and others had those 10 years to organize freely.","Evangelicals too often fall short in their actual teachings about Judaism.","You can do a no-fly zone without ground forces.","I think President Obama views Israel as a problem that needs to be solved.","The Iron Dome is great for the U.S.","After 9/11, we did see Palestinian terrorism in the context of all terrorism.","The Iranians don't want the same thing we do in Iraq, not really; they want to control Iraq... the Ayatollah hates the United States; the Iranians are enemies of the United States.","Obama isn't good off the cuff, especially when challenged; he is far better with a prepared speech.","Never fight turf on turf. Fight it on the basis of ideas.","The Sandinistas are dedicated Communists, and if they are going to make a compromise with democracy, it's going to be under pressure.","People are entitled to believe the government is constantly lying to them, but it isn't.","I want to be the first guy to reverse a communist revolution.","George McGovern and his supporters committed what, in a two-party system, are capital crimes: they did not compromise, they took hard ideological positions, they alienated a large portion of their party's traditional supporters, and they lost - very, very badly.","Legislation for the Caribbean basin has led to more jobs in the Dominican Republic.","While we use American power to fight hard for democracy against extremism on both left and right, our critics seem suspicious of any assertion of United States power or influence against any government or group that claims to be on the left.","Is multilateralism nothing more than a dodge for simple inaction?","As the Palestinian leadership never seems to pay any penalty for its words, America's seriousness about the peace process is in doubt.","The truce brokered by Egypt between Israel and Hamas depends, above all, on the borders between Egypt, Gaza and Israel.","If Iran gets a nuclear weapon, its influence and that of Hamas and Hezbollah are strengthened.","American power remains today what it was in the Second World War and the Cold War: the greatest force for freedom in the world.","The Right is simply more pro-Israel than the Left.","Rahm Emanuel seems to think he knows Israel very well, and that the way to treat that country and its democratically-elected government is the way he treats all opponents in politics: by attacking and attacking.","President Bush met repeatedly with human rights activists and freedom fighters from all over the world to give them encouragement and protection and to advance their cause.","Olmert made a proposal on the governing of Jerusalem that I do not believe his cabinet or the Knesset would have accepted.","It's not good for Israel to govern millions of Palestinians.","What Israel wants is peace with - and the acknowledgment of - all the Arab countries.","On taking office in 2009, U.S. President Barack Obama put Israeli settlements at the center of U.S. policy in the Middle East.","At Camp David in 2000, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak offered the Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat 94 percent of the West Bank; ten years later, Ehud Olmert offered Abbas 93.6 percent with a one-to-one land swap.","From its earliest days in the nineteenth century, and until the Holocaust, the Orthodox rabbinate in eastern Europe was not enthusiastic about the Zionist movement, which at the time was led by irreligious Jews.","Refusing to lift sanctions and adopting tougher rhetoric toward Iran would not be partisan issues. Plenty of Democrats think that those actions are both good politics and good policy.","Israel bombed the Syrian nuclear reactor in 2007. What the Syrians did in response, nothing. Israel has killed a number of terrorist leaders in Syria. Response? Nothing.","Even today, when the Obama administration has liberalized travel to Cuba - and failed to reverse that liberalization when Alan Gross was imprisoned - there are limits.","There are examples of fraternal dictatorships, or one, anyway: the passing of power from Fidel to Raul Castro.","In the Philippines, Gloria Arroyo is the daughter of Diosdado Macapagal - but his term ended in 1965, and she was elected in 2001. Hardly a hand-off.","The attack on the British embassy in Tehran came just days after the Iranian 'parliament' voted to expel the British ambassador, and therefore reeks of official complicity.","Iran exports about 2.2 million barrels a day.","There is no way around the contradictions and dangers inherent in Israel's decision to free over 1,000 prisoners in order to liberate Gilad Shalit.","The ransoming of captives has been practiced by Jews for many centuries and has been regarded as a greater obligation than charity for the poor.","Israel and the Palestinians had been at the table together for decades until the Obama/Mitchell/Rahm Emanuel decision to demand a total end to Israeli construction froze not the settlements but the diplomacy.","When a deeply sympathetic American president asks for concessions and compromises and appears able to cajole some from the Palestinians, which was the Clinton/Rabin and Bush/Sharon combination, Israel must respond.","The Knesset is in Israel, and the Western Wall is in Israel, and the sooner the Obama administration realizes this, the closer it will be to a Middle East policy worthy of our country and its long alliance with our ally in Jerusalem - which is, actually, the capital of the state of Israel.","Immanuel Kant famously claimed that 'he who wills the ends wills the means,' but he never spent much time in Washington.","Turkey's solidarity with Hamas is not, of course, based on Arab nationalism, which as a non-Arab nation it does not support. It is instead based on a definition of the Mideast conflict as one between Jews and Muslims, precisely the position of Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda.","Needless to say, if the Arab-Israeli conflict is about interstate disputes and the need to resolve the future of the West Bank and Gaza, it can be solved; if it is a religious conflict, nothing but violence is ahead.","The anchors of the Arab consensus have long been Egypt and Saudi Arabia, and both are now weakened forces in Arab politics and diplomacy.","History may someday record that the Arab awakening that began with the Arab revolt of 1916 against the Ottomans ended about a century later with a whimper.","At the United Nations, a lynch mob for Israel is always just a moment away.","The U.S. has the power to block all anti-Israel moves in the Security Council, not just some of them, and to do so without agreeing to unfair, damaging compromises.","It is a keen measure of the fall of American influence in the region when a Palestinian leader responds to intense American pressure to go to the negotiating table by waiting to see if Arab League foreign ministers will let him take that step.","Those who cannot remember the past are condemned, it seems, to direct the Middle East policy of the Obama administration.","The failure to set standards for Palestinian conduct hurts the cause of peace.","In the Bill Clinton years, the foreign leader who visited the White House most often was Yasser Arafat - 13 times.","A great nation like the United States has many and varied interests, and we need both to do business with tyrants and to engage constantly in multilateral diplomacy.","America's relations with complex Middle Eastern states such as Egypt are often difficult.","During most of the Bush administration, human rights and democracy in Egypt were on the front burner.","President Bush was disgusted by the Assad regime's oppression of the Syrian people as well as its support for terrorism, interference in Lebanon, and encouragement of jihadist attacks on Americans in Iraq.","Peace in the Middle East has been on the Obama administration's mind from the beginning. Two days after his inauguration, the president traveled to the State Department to announce the appointment of George Mitchell as his Middle East peace negotiator.","The Obama administration rarely demonstrated the ability to shift gears and change policy in its first year. Even in the face of historic events such as the continuing demonstrations against Iran's regime, it stuck devotedly to prior plans.","The way for the Palestinians to get a state is to go ahead and build it.","Times change. Cable news and the Internet alone have transformed the way outreach to the American people can be accomplished.","The Obama administration has been trying out a new policy toward Syria since the day it came to office. The Bush cold shoulder was viewed as a primitive reaction, now to be replaced by sophisticated diplomacy. Outreach would substitute for isolation.","Arab states continue to send the Palestinians gifts of extravagant rhetoric and countless Arab League resolutions - but not much cash.","I call on the Palestinian people to elect new leaders - leaders not compromised by terror.","A Palestinian state will never be created by terror.","The United States already has in place comprehensive trade sanctions against Sudan, imposed because of the regime's support for terrorism. While we maintain diplomatic relations, we do not staff our embassy there.","An effective U.S. policy toward Sudan - one capable of changing the situation in the south and affecting the lives of its people - will require top-level attention and a great deal of energy. It should have three elements: aid, diplomacy, and financial disclosure.","The United States should help strengthen nongovernmental humanitarian agencies working in Sudan so that they can handle an increased flow of aid.","If the president of the United States says that attacks on civilians, starvation, and denial of religious freedom in Sudan are important international issues, they become so.","Thousands of members of Congress have come and gone over the years, their individual achievements hidden in committee reports, private compromises, amendments pushed through or blocked, and innumerable, unnoticed meetings.","Henry M. Jackson, congressman and senator from 1941 until his death in 1983, achieved far greater renown than most legislators, ran for president in 1972 and 1976, and was for much of the 1970s and 1980s one of the most powerful men in America.","While Argentina, Brazil, and Chile - what in textbooks used to be called the ABC countries - seem settled into democratic politics and free market economics, the Andean countries are in disarray.","I don't see kids with Palm Pilots. They are not common on college campuses, except among professors. Gen Xers don't need them. They are a phenomenon of the 50-something who can't remember if his broker's number ends in 1137 or 3317.","In public, an admission of technological inadequacy would be too embarrassing.","While foreign competitors, French or Japanese or German, merrily bid for contracts abroad, American companies find themselves tangled in a web of legislation designed to express disapproval, block trade in certain commodities, or perhaps deny resources to disfavored or hostile regimes.","Opponents of U.S. sanctions have made 'unilateral sanctions' their special target. They argue that sanctions observed by many nations would be much more effective. True enough. Far better for trade with an outlaw regime to be restricted by many nations than by just one.","Like all forms of collective security, multilateral sanctions require a unanimity rarely achieved in international politics.","The logic of collective security is flawless, provided it can be made to work under the conditions prevailing on the international scene... The odds, however, are strongly against such a possibility.","Mass killing has very clearly not been eliminated, nor has the 'international community' developed a response that will avert it or bring it to a quick end.","There's always Tunisia. Amid the smoking ruins of the Middle East, there is that one encouraging success story.","The Middle East that Obama inherited in 2009 was largely at peace, for the surge in Iraq had beaten down the al Qaeda-linked groups. U.S. relations with traditional allies in the Gulf, Jordan, Israel and Egypt were very good. Iran was contained, its Revolutionary Guard forces at home.","The United States and its Gulf allies, some of who are actively funding rebel groups in Syria, should undertake a serious joint review of Jordan's needs and then act together to meet them.","Reagan did not wait out the Soviets; he beat them.","The United States should encourage Israel to take further steps to improve the Palestinian economy.","Four years is a long time in politics.","The story of the Jews in the Bible is replete with incidents of their ingratitude to God for His gifts to them: incidents that just as repeatedly merit and receive punishment.","Egypt needs law and order in Sinai to save the tourist industry in Sharm el-Sheik and prevent the area from becoming a base for terrorists that will target Egypt itself, as well as Jordan and Israel.","In 2007, early in the improbable presidential candidacy of Barack Obama, the young first-term senator began a series of foreign-policy speeches that seemed too general to provide a guide to what he might do if elected.","Obama's foreign policy is strangely self-centered, focused on himself and the United States rather than on the conduct and needs of the nations the United States allies with, engages with, or must confront.","The Obama administration has vastly expanded the use of armed drones and concentrated a great deal of diplomatic effort on building and maintaining alliances that share information about terrorists, provide access to get near them, and then strike against them.","Pinochet took power in a 1973 military coup that the United States supported.","Denmark has long been regarded as one of the world's most attractive nations, for citizens and tourists alike. My own visits there, years ago as a student, were delightful.","While Israelis do not care too much about Europeans moral judgments, the E.U. is an important market for them, and European sanctions of any kind would be harmful to Israel.","The devastation of the ancient Christian community in Iraq is well known.","Scandinavia is boring. People living there apparently have little to do. And as European history teaches, when there is nothing much to do, you may as well amuse yourself by attacking the Jews.","For 22 years, Bandar bin Sultan was Saudi Arabia's influential, irrepressible ambassador in Washington.","Can Israelis be wistful? It is not the characteristic we usually associate with them; more typically they are said to be tough, sweet, angry, thoughtful, demanding - not wistful.","Does anyone believe that Kofi Annan scares Bashar Assad?","The presence of jihadis in Syria should be no surprise.","On June 19, 1981, a vigorously healthy Justice Potter Stewart resigned from the Supreme Court at the age of 66.","The Obama administration appears to regard intelligence leaks and briefings more or less like briefings by the Democratic National Committee or White House flack Jay Carney. You use any information at hand, classified or not, and you spin it any way you like, fairly or not.","The Egyptian military and the government of Israel have long had a common interest in maintaining order and fighting terrorism in Sinai.","Tunisian liberals say that the U.S. Embassy in Tunis is unengaged with their efforts to make sure the Tunisian model remains one of expanding freedom.","When freedom of the press is threatened, the United States should be leading efforts to protect it.","What does 'politicizing intelligence' mean? Using intel, or more often, partial intel, to produce an effect in line with White House policies rather than giving a full picture of a particular situation.","Pundits are used to analyzing the gap between what our ideals suggest and what our security interests require.","President Obama has never summarized the Obama Doctrine with such clarity, but here is what it would look like: 'I will undertake any military attack against our enemies, regardless of the risks and collateral damage, so long as it is over by the time I have to announce it.'","Barack Obama's military triumphs will come neither in long wars nor even short ones, but in a series of raids.","There is no softer target in GOP primaries than the United Nations and foreign-aid spending.","The Assad regime has lost the consent of the governed, and it is difficult to see how a replacement Alawite regime would be able to regain this consent.","The early reviews of Dick Cheney's memoir have not evaluated the book, but instead have used its publication as an occasion for attacks on Cheney and his record, with general assaults on George W. Bush's administration thrown in for good measure.","Cheney's memoir is not about 9/11, or solely about Bush's administration, but about his entire life and political career.","Syria's population is 74% Sunni Muslim.","The best-armed and best-trained divisions of the Syrian army are Alawite.","In Kuwait there is already a real, elected parliament with genuine power, but the prime minister is always a member of the ruling al-Sabah family. That must end.","Reformist kings can save their dynasties now by helping their countries move smoothly into democracy, or they will end their years in exile like the Russian aristocrats of a century earlier.","Every Arab 'republic' has been a republic of fear, but only Saddam Hussein's Iraq surpassed the Assads' Syria in number of victims.","Gadhafi's vicious regime has left Libya far worse than he found it on the day of his coup in 1969.","Gadhafi has established no national institutions, not even allowing a fake parliament of the Mubarak or Ben Ali variety that could perhaps be turned into something real.","The United States treated Gaddafi as an enemy due to his support for terrorism against us, until a rapprochement of sorts began under Pres. George W. Bush at the very end of 2003.","Moammar Gaddafi, who has called himself the 'Guide of the First of September Great Revolution of the Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya,' should go down in history with the Emperor Bokassa and Idi Amin as a grotesque reminder of why people have the right to change their government.","It's time to bury the unreal, failed 'realism' of those who have long thought that dictators brought stability.","Obviously, every dictator pays a great deal of attention to who is running the army. There's always a base right outside the capitol to protect the head of government.","Tunisia was not for the United States an important country in the way, let's say, Algeria was because of its gas, because of its size, because of its struggle against terrorism that sometimes turned bloody.","Tunisia is small - just ten million, no great natural resources.","Sari Nusseibeh is a man without a country.","Why are diplomatic cables secret at all?","Huge numbers of embassy cables are labeled 'unclassified' or 'limited official use' and deal with mundane matters.","In most cases, cables are marked secret not because the U.S. requires it but because those speaking to us - the foreign leaders across the table - do. They are not keeping secrets from us, but from two other groups: their enemies and their subjects.","The Arab view that someone should bomb Iran and stop it from developing nuclear weapons is familiar to anyone who meets privately with Arab leaders, especially in the Gulf.","The Erdogan government's first major step outside of the U.S. alliance was during the Bush Administration, when it wouldn't let Washington use Turkey as a launching ground for U.S. troops entering Iraq in 2003.","Every Israeli government since 1967, of left or right, has asserted that Jerusalem is Israel's capital and has allowed Israeli Jews to build there.","At the height of the Cold War, when Ronald Reagan was president, the Soviets and their allies and satellites did not shirk human rights debates with the West. They had their arguments ready.","I first met Kim Dae Jung when he was a Korean dissident whose life was threatened by the military regime ruling in Seoul. I was Ronald Reagan's Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights, and Kim was directed to me because the East Asia Bureau at the State Department had long shunned him.","Harry Truman, who was a Bible-believing Christian Zionist, defied the secretary of state he so admired, George C. Marshall, and won a place in Israel's history by recognizing the new state 11 minutes after it declared its independence in 1948.","There are no Muslim ghettos in the U.S.","Grasping the realities of the Middle East is never easy. This is not primarily because they change quickly, but because so much time, effort, and money is spent to prevent reality from breaking through.","In the spring of 2007, Israeli intelligence brought to Washington proof that the Assad regime in Syria was building a nuclear reactor along the Euphrates - with North Korean help. This reactor was a copy of the Yongbyon reactor the North Koreans had built, and was part of a Syrian nuclear weapons program.","Pessimism is rife in Israel.","The debate over same sex 'marriage' has engaged the heartfelt feelings and convictions of millions of Americans.","The U.A.E. is a firm ally of the United States and deserves better treatment than it received in the Dubai Ports World fiasco in 2006."],"Elliott Bisnow":["There is no greater feeling in business than building a product which impacts people's lives in a profound way. When we look around at the thousands of people who have attended Summit gatherings, it makes us smile to see the new friendships, business partnerships and philanthropic initiatives that each event produces.","Entrepreneurship, entrepreneurship, entrepreneurship. It drives everything: Job creation, poverty alleviation, innovation.","Believe it or not, the first spark for everything I've done today came down to me meeting one person in college who changed my life. A student named Anthony Adams who lived across the hall from me in our freshman dorm showed me what it meant to be an 'entrepreneur' when I saw him launch his own start-up company.","Everyone has an 'I thought Elliott was crazy' story.","The only currency isn't money. For me, it's about how can you build a good business that's also a social business.","That's what my life has come down to - how can I have fun for me, be with my friends and my family, and how can I help other people.","I believe the quickest and most sure way to reduce poverty, raise living standards and create jobs around the world is to make economies and governments more open and free, thereby encouraging business and entrepreneurship."],"Elliott Carter":["Silences between movements are employed only in order to bring the opposing duo to the fore.","That was one of the big problems when I was at Harvard studying music. We had to write choral pieces in the style of Brahms or Mendelssohn, which was distressing because in the end you realized how good Brahms is, and how bad you are.","The Third Quartet I made the instruments in pairs - Two different pairs - Violin and viola, and violin and cello. They played very different things from each other all through the whole piece.","My entire life has really revolved around music that was written about the time that I was born, 1908, to just before the First World War and shortly after it. This music I've always known, and it is that music that's most important to me.","An auditory scenario for the players to act out with their instruments.","Well when I was young, when I was very young, when I was a little boy I don't remember the music I heard, but there was an article in the Brooklyn Daily written by my Aunt about how I could choose phonograph records.","I've known those pieces ever since I was about 16 or 17; I also at that time was taken to meet Charles Ives whom I got to know fairly well. He was the one who wrote a recommendation for me to get into college.","In any case, Ives encouraged me to go into music even though he himself had such a hard time being a composer.","It was only later on that I became more interested in older music.","These wealthy people were very interested in contemporary music. They wanted to help diffuse it and get it to be known to other people.","Then, when the Depression came, all of this changed completely. Since that time, the entire public is of a very different sort and there was not so much support for contemporary music in a direct way.","I mean the public likes it more in Europe than they do here because the state supported organizations have felt that playing contemporary music was part of the education of the public.","Talking about a materialistic thing, I get about 13 times more royalties from Europe than I do from America.","Yes, I get a report from BMI about the frequency of performances, and it is very surprising. They played one of my most advanced pieces, and one of my most unusual ones on the radio.","Almost every one of my various zero numbered birthdays has had a big concert in London and often in Paris.","Well I tried to, but I could never write anything that I liked or was worthwhile. I threw it all out and realized that I had to make a serious study- that my tastes were far more advanced than my abilities.","When I was in Paris, all of the German refugees began to flow in and it was a very sad time.","Since I'm allergic to various things, the army wouldn't accept me during the war, and I got into the Office of War Information, which sent music to Europe.","Aaron Copland was a man that had a very specific point of view about what music should be which was that, he felt that new music should have the composer should show a personality in his music.","Right at the end of the war I wrote a piano sonata, which was written at a time when Sam Barber used to come down here and we used to have lunch together in a very nice old hotel that's now not there.","The Quartets have been a major part of my work.","Why write for the orchestra? For one thing it's a very challenging problem."],"Elliott Erwitt":["I enjoy nothing more than spending time with my loved ones, young and old, and at least once a year we get together for a formal family photograph.","To me, photography is an art of observation. It's about finding something interesting in an ordinary place... I've found it has little to do with the things you see and everything to do with the way you see them.","I appreciate simplicity, true beauty that lasts over time, and a little wit and eclecticism that make life more fun.","Photography is pretty simple stuff. You just react to what you see, and take many, many pictures.","I'm an amateur photographer, apart from being a professional one, and I think maybe my amateur pictures are the better ones.","Be sure to take the lens cap off before photographing.","You can find pictures anywhere. It's simply a matter of noticing things and organizing them. You just have to care about what's around you and have a concern with humanity and the human comedy.","I'll always be an amateur photographer.","Somehow Photoshop and the ease with which one can produce an image has degraded the quality of photography in general.","The thing is that when you don't carry a camera, that's when you see pictures in particular, or at least that's when you think you see pictures in particular. When you do carry it, if you do see one on the occasion that you do, you can take it.","A visual sense is something you either have or you don't.","My 'work' is about seeing not about ideas.","Now very often events are set up for photographers... The weddings are orchestrated about the photographers taking the picture, because if it hasn't been photographed it doesn't really exist.","Covering a historic event is perfectly legitimate. It's not sneaking into somebody's boudoir... These people belong to history, and not to record that if you have the opportunity would be wrong.","I'm not a serious photographer like many of my contemporaries. That is to say, I am serious about not being serious.","All of my marriages lasted seven years.","Professionally I've evolved with what's required, but the pictures I do for pleasure haven't changed, except for the cars in the background, the clothing. I haven't changed at all.","I don't really have a favorite camera. I use a Leica and Canon a lot. It depends, especially professionally, on the requirements. But my carry-around camera is a Leica.","Making books is a very specific kind of activity. It's not really a collection of your best pictures - although it is - but it's also a way of presenting your work so that it's not repetitive, so that it flows, and so that it makes sense in a book.","The ratio of successful shots is one in God-knows-how-many. Sometimes you'll get several in one contact sheet, and sometimes it's none for days. But as long as you go on taking pictures, you're likely to get a good one at some point.","In those simpler days, you could just take pictures of movie stars and show them the way they were, as normal human beings. And if I felt part of any movement at the time, it was just to do that - to be journalistic and photograph what is, rather than what is made up.","It's almost embarrassing, but I do have one trick for taking portraits on commission. I carry one of these little bicycle horns in my pocket, and once in a while, when someone is sour-faced or stiff, I blow my horn. It sort of shatters the barriers. It's silly, but it works.","Most photographers work best alone, myself included.","If your subjects are eternal... they'll survive.","My life has been quite interesting professionally.","The advantage of taking pictures of the famous is that they get published.","I've been around so long, most editors think I'm dead.","When I get up in the morning I brush my teeth and go about my business, and if I am going anywhere interesting I take my camera along.","Everybody's got to do something... I'd been on my own since an early age and I thought I better find something to do to buy biscuits and stuff. From high school onwards I was earning my way with photography, one way or another, working in darkrooms and taking pictures of weddings, neighbors' children and so on.","I like museums in Berlin a lot, especially in the eastern part. They're extraordinarily good.","The most awful museums are in China. They have magnificent stuff on display and just the worst way of displaying it. They just don't spend money on lighting and installation."],"Elliott Gould":["My greatest fear is to be misunderstood.","I was changing a light bulb over Groucho Marx's bed, so I took my shoes off, got on his bed and changed the bulb. When I got off the bed he said: 'That's the best acting you've ever done.'","I find it so easy to get distracted - I try not to do more than one thing at any one time.","My problem was I let myself become known before I knew myself.","There's nothing more arrogant or conceited than youth, and there's nothing other than machinery that can replace youth."],"Elliott Smith":["If you play acoustic guitar you're the depressed, sensitive guy.","There's always that argument to make - that you're in better company historically if people don't understand what you're doing.","I'm just writing songs about how I feel or about how people I know feel.","I didn't have a hard time making it, I had a hard time letting it go.","Well, I try not to think about the general public since I have no idea what the general public is and I don't think anybody does.","I actually don't think that I'm gonna sell a lot of records.","But I was also doing odd jobs around Portland, like spreading gravel and transplanting bamboo trees.","I wondered if I would talk about drug use. But I guess, why hide it?","Because God only knows why people like what they like and don't like something else.","It's just that a lot of songs that are popular right now, they don't have any meaning.","The band's filter, but playing live is a lot of fun.","I mean people just have a way of - y'know they'll review your record in two sentences and put you in this little stupid box that you don't want to be in.","It's a lot easier to tell the truth usually.","It touches on drug use. I got caught up in that for almost two years.","I was coming off of a lot of psyche meds and other things.","I can't think of anything off the top of my head that seems more important than something designed to raise money to keep something going that keeps IV drug users from dying.","It was kind of ridiculous to carry it up to a certain point and then drop the ball or the bomb, like quitting the band right after we had signed to Virgin.","I watched myself put my paw in the bear trap on that one because there was this clause about leaving members.","My girlfriend at the time convinced me to send these songs to Cavity Search. When they wanted to put out my record I was totally shocked.","I didn't think I was gonna be playing on the Oscars or anything.","I was trying to do the same thing that I always do which is make an interesting record.","I don't think that Dreamworks would have signed me expecting to really mess around with whatever it is I do.","I like home recordings and studio recordings just as much as each other - I don't think one is better - but for this record I wanted to see what I could do in a real studio with real producers.","And I'm not trying to write heavy songs.","I just wanted to move out of Portland to do something.","I don't really like New York better than Portland. It's just a different place.","I didn't know how many people knew who Ferdinand was.","There are lots of things I like about playing in a band, the things I can't do by myself you know.","I rode on a float in one of the parades in Mississippi. It's an experience."],"Elliott Yamin":["To me, obstacles in life build character. You have to be able to overcome adversity in order to succeed and appreciate the simple things life has to offer... that's where most of my inspiration for writing and singing comes from.","Quite frankly, I'm tired of taking insulin and pumping my stomach every three days and pricking my finger and drawing blood out of it every day - it's a tedious, meticulous, annoying disease that never goes away. And I want to get rid of it like everybody else does.","Before 'Idol,' I was lost... Now, I've actually followed through with something. I am a better man for it!","My dad's Israeli. He was born in Baghdad to Iraqi Jews. Then, at age two, his parents wanted to move to their homeland and he grew up in Israel. I've been there twice, once as a baby and once when I was 15.","Growing up, I can remember singing along with my ma all of the time. I wouldn't say she necessarily 'taught' me how to sing, but she was definitely the first person to inspire me to sing and the first to intrigue me vocally. I've always had a natural ear for music, though.","I come from a family with big hearts, so I love to put smiles on people's faces.","Music's something you feel. You have to feel it first before you hear it.","I think the fact that I am living my dream and being really productive and embarking on all my lifelong aspirations is proof enough that if I can do it, anyone can. I try to tell everybody to dream big and go after their dreams.","I was introduced to soul music at a very young age - my mom was a soul singer.","When I was a kid, I remember trying to emulate Stevie Wonder's sound, and Donny Hathaway's sound. It's just part of who I am - I'm just a soulful kind of dude.","I'm still Elliott Yamin. I'm still the funky white Jewish boy from Richmond, Va."],"Ellis Peters":["Every spring is the only spring, a perpetual astonishment.","Truth, like the burgeoning of a bulb under the soil, however deeply sown, will make its way to the light.","There is in the end no remedy but truth. It is the one course that cannot be evil.","Truth can be costly, but in the end it never falls short of value for the price paid.","To have faith in Divine protection is good, but even beter if backed by the pratical assistance heaven has a right to expect from sensible mortals.","It takes a lot to wound a man without illusions.","Nothing is more pleasing and engaging than the sense of having conferred benefits. Not even the gratification of receiving them.","I go to Prague every year if I can, value my relationships there like gold, and feel myself in a sense Czech, with all their hopes and needs. They are a people I not only love, but admire.","Death, after all, is the common expectation from birth. Neither heroes nor cowards can escape it."],"Ellsworth Huntington":["History in its broadest aspect is a record of man's migrations from one environment to another.","We are learning, too, that the love of beauty is one of Nature's greatest healers.","Although mountains may guide migrations, the plains are the regions where people dwell in greatest numbers.","Man could not stay there forever. He was bound to spread to new regions, partly because of his innate migratory tendency and partly because of Nature's stern urgency.","In America the most widespread type of forest is the evergreen coniferous woodland of the north.","In fact, the history of North America has been perhaps more profoundly influenced by man's inheritance from his past homes than by the physical features of his present home.","America forms the longest and straightest bone in the earth's skeleton.","Today, no less than in the past, the tetrahedral form of the earth and the relation of the tetrahedron to the poles and to the equator preserve the conditions that favor rapid evolution.","Fertile soil, level plains, easy passage across the mountains, coal, iron, and other metals imbedded in the rocks, and a stimulating climate, all shower their blessings upon man.","Nevertheless most of the evergreen forests of the north must always remain the home of wild animals and trappers, a backward region in which it is easy for a great fur company to maintain a practical monopoly.","The buffalo is a surprisingly stupid animal.","Surprising as it may seem, this study indicates that similar conditions are best for all sorts of races.","A journey of four hundred and thirty miles can be made in any part of the United States, but in Turkey it takes as many days.","After washing there was no place to pour the water except out of the window onto the heads of the people in the streets, which is the proper place to throw everything that is not wanted.","America is the last great goal of these migrations.","The Negro, however, has been tested on an extensive scale.","According to the now almost universally accepted theory, all the races of mankind had a common origin.","For the source of any characteristic so widespread and uniform as this adaptation to environment we must go back to the very beginning of the human race.","Again and again, to be sure, on the way to America, and under many other circumstances, man has passed through the most adverse climates and has survived, but he has flourished and waxed strong only in certain zones.","Curiously enough man's body and his mind appear to differ in their climatic adaptations.","Thus the races, though alike in their physical response to climate, may possibly be different in their mental response because they have approached America by different paths.","The evidence points to central Asia as man's original home, for the general movement of human migrations has been outward from that region and not inward.","Geologists are rapidly becoming convinced that the mammals spread from their central Asian point of origin largely because of great variations in climate.","The human organism inherits so delicate an adjustment to climate that, in spite of man's boasted ability to live anywhere, the strain of the frozen North eliminates the more nervous and active types of mind.","It seems strange that almost no other traces of the strong vikings are found in America.","The geysers and hot springs of the Yellowstone are another proof of recent volcanic activity.","Year by year we are learning that in this restless, strenuous American life of ours vacations are essential.","No part of the world can be truly understood without a knowledge of its garment of vegetation, for this determines not only the nature of the animal inhabitants but also the occupations of the majority of human beings.","Except on their southern borders the great northern forests are not good as a permanent home for man.","As a matter of fact, an ordinary desert supports a much greater variety of plants than does either a forest or a prairie.","The coast of British Columbia was one of the three chief centers of aboriginal America.","The Indians could not undertake any widespread cultivation of the plains not only because they lacked iron tools but also because they had no draft animals.","Although farming of any sort was almost as impossible in the plains as in the dry regions of winter rains farther west, the abundance of buffaloes made life much easier in many respects.","From first to last the civilization of America has been bound up with its physical environment."],"Ellsworth Kelly":["When I see a white piece of paper, I feel I've got to draw. And drawing, for me, is the beginning of everything.","The negative is just as important as the positive.","One of the first drawings I did in Paris - I wasn't thinking of doing drawings, but somehow or other, I kept drawing - I bought a hyacinth flower with a lot of leaves, just to make me feel like spring.","My forms are geometric, but they don't interact in a geometric sense. They're just forms that exist everywhere, even if you don't see them.","All my work comes from perceiving. I kept seeing things that were brooding in me. I'm not a geometric artist.","I said, I don't want to paint things like Picasso's women and Matisse's odalisques lying on couches with pillows. I don't want to paint people. I want to paint something I have never seen before. I don't want to make what I'm looking at. I want the fragments.","I'm constantly investigating nature - nature, meaning everything.","Geometry is moribund. I want a lilt and joy to art.","My earliest drawing is a supposed Carracci. It wasn't very expensive, I guess, because they don't know if it's a real Carracci. But it has all these seals on it of people who've owned it, and one of the great portrait painters of England, Reynolds, had owned it, so that's the earliest.","I always felt that a painted edge between two colors was a depiction somehow.","I've always wanted... I wanted to give people joy.","I just feel like I can live on. I hope I can reach 100. I think today if you just keep doing, keep working, that - maybe that's possible.","In Paris in the late '40s, I started making my first reliefs. They are separate panels. I wanted to do something coming out of the wall, almost like a collage. I did a lot of white reliefs when I started because I liked antique reliefs, really old stuff.","I'm interested in the space between the viewer and the surface of the painting - the forms and the way they work in their surroundings. I'm interested in how they react to a room.","I started doing sculpture in 1959. I had no commissions then. They were painted, similar in style to the paintings... At a certain point, I decided I didn't want an edge between two colors, I wanted color differences in literal space.","The paintings to me are always canvas; sculpture has always been metal, though I have made sculpture in wood, also.","I have a sort of inner sense for scale.","My drawings have to be quick. If they don't happen in 20 minutes or a half hour, then they're no good.","I only like artists older than myself. Time is so important. It's always been the same way, I guess.","I learned my color in Europe. I've always been a colorist, I think. I started when I was very young, being a bird-watcher, fascinated by the bird colors.","I don't like mixed colors that much, like plum color or deep, deep colors that are hard to define.","I like to be able to get swift curves in the plant drawings that are usually drawn in five to ten minutes.","I don't labor over my drawings. I want to get freedom in the line.","All my work begins with drawings.","In Boston, I developed my eye from the drawing. In Paris, I was fascinated by what my eye saw in the way that Paris is built, its 'measure.'","My ideas come, wh-pheww. And I draw. Just recently, when I'm searching for ideas for paintings and sculptures, I wait for ideas, and it's always visual.","My ideas I can find anywhere. And I draw because I have to note down my ideas or flashes - I call them flashes, because they come to me, like that. Not so much in the plant drawings. I have to see them.","Shading is more like copying. And certainly I do copy, but I'm making drawings, and I'm not trying to make them with the shading.","I have trained my eye over and over ever since I was a kid. I was a bird watcher when I was a little boy. My grandmother gave me a bird book, and I got to like their colors.","I was taught to draw very well when I was in school at Boston. And I grew to enjoy drawing so much that I never stopped.","Gray goes with gold. Gray goes with all colors. I've done gray-and-red paintings, and gray and orange go so well together. It takes a long time to make gray because gray has a little bit of color in it.","I sometimes don't try to invent something. I wait for some kind of a direction - and it happens. I get an angle, for instance, and it just appears, and I say, 'Oh my God - that's it!'","I'm not an Expressionist. I love to look at de Kooning, but I've got this kind of secret life, and that is something that pleases me. I have to try and make something out of it.","I did not want windows, only skylights. I chose my painting wall as it has the best morning light.","I like silence.","All my paintings are usually done in drawing form, very small. I make notations in drawings first, and then I make a collage for color. But drawing is always my notation.","Matisse draws what I call the essence of the plants. He leaves a shape open. He'll do a leaf and not close it. Everybody used to say, oh, I got it all from Matisse, and I said, 'Not really.'","Shape and color are my two strong things. And by doing this, drawing plants has always led me into my paintings and my sculptures.","Each drawing that I've done, I have found. Meaning, I see a plant I want to draw.","Time has always been very important in my work.","I don't like acrylic because you can't get the density of color. And with each coat of oil paint, the surface gets better and richer."],"Elmer Bernstein":["Victor Young had been hired to write the score for the dances of The Ten Commandments but he became very ill. You were then hired to write the score. But at the same time you'd written The Man with the Golden Arm score.","I did 10 years of comedies and 10 years of Westerns. I really like to stay away from car chases. I prefer the more intimate film. You have a much more direct association with the emotions.","One of the things that happens in the business is that success is a very strange thing in that if you are involved in something very successful the next person wants you to repeat it.","I'm generally pessimistic about the dumbing down of America - especially with summer movies.","There's no way I can compete with someone who can write rap or rock and roll. Nor do I wish to. But I've always kept up to date with music changes. I worked very hard not to type myself.","You wouldn't think it would but my parents were really balanced about that. When it came time for me to be out of the house and out on my own they were very supportive.","I thought in terms of the enthusiasm of doing it. I didn't think about whether I was ready.","I would do the occasional score. I thought it was the most thrilling thing. It was instant. You made the music and they played it right away to millions of people. I found it thrilling.","It was a great way to work. In those days, you had to be there. It was your world. It was your club. Your friends were there, your associates were there, your security was there.","When you stop to think about it, so many films today where we don't have that kind of contact are films about alienation. About alienated feelings. We are much more alienated from our colleagues nowadays.","Today you have something like A Film by Joe Harry. That is patently asinine and ridiculous.","I made my way on to a grey list, a black list even. That's something I'm very proud of, actually."],"Elmer Davis":["This nation will remain the land of the free only so long as it is the home of the brave.","I believe that if the entire voting population of the United States could be taken in small groups on a personally conducted tour of even the neutral countries of Europe, 85 percent of them would vote next November for any presidential candidate of any party who could convincingly promise them a big navy and conscription.","This republic was not established by cowards; and cowards will not preserve it.","When a middle-aged man says in a moment of weariness that he is half dead, he is telling the literal truth.","New York was growing so fast that the extraordinary prosperity which attended 'The Times' almost from the outset brought no real injury to any of its important rivals; for years thereafter, they all grew and prospered together.","Freedom of ideas and communications is one of the things we are fighting for, and our enemies are fighting against.","This will remain the land of the free only so long as it is the home of the brave.","The American public has a right to know what's going on.","One of the things that is wrong with America is that everybody who has done anything at all in his own field is expected to be an authority on every subject under the sun.","The first and great commandment is, don't let them scare you.","This nation was conceived in liberty and dedicated to the principle - among others - that honest men may honestly disagree; that if they all say what they think, a majority of the people will be able to distinguish truth from error.","Tammany Hall and slavery usually found 'The Herald' on their side.","The chief characteristic of 'The Tribune' under Greeley was an aggressive and even ostentatious purity. 'Immoral and degrading police reports,' and any notices of the existence of the theater, whether in news or advertising, were at first scrupulously excluded.","It is a curious foible of a certain type of mind that it is unable to imagine a newspaper editor as one who may, on some public questions, honestly have the same view as that held by other persons.","We are going to use the truth, and we are going to use it toward the end of winning the war; and we know what would happen to the American people if we lose it.","It's becoming plainer and plainer that what is going on in South America and in South-Eastern Asia is directly related to the war in Russia, for they are all parts of one single Great World War.","There is an increasing demand that the president and Secretary Hull get rid of the unteachable group in the State Department of men who have not learned, after ten years of experience, that appeasement has never worked anywhere, at any time.","You may not like Mr. Roosevelt, but if he loss the war, we all lose it with him.","We can't let censorship take over.","The easiest way to propagandize people is to let a propaganda theme go in through an entertainment picture when people do not realize they are being propagandized.","This is a people's war, and to win it, the people should know as much about it as they can.","Large elements in Congress and the public were willing to fight for victory but wanted to be very sure that the struggle was not contaminated by any moral principles.","This nation has given the world an object lesson in the whole duty of neutrals, which is to furnish an outlet for the wrath of a belligerent who is annoyed because he cannot defeat his opponent.","The whole government publicity situation has everybody in the news business almost in despair, with half a dozen agencies following different lines.","There are some patriotic citizens who sincerely hope that America will win the war - but they also hope that Russia will lose it; and there are some who hope that America will win the war, but that England will lose it; and there are some who hope that America will win the war, but that Roosevelt will lose it."],"Elmer Rice":["Men and women of high professional standing have been reduced to the status of vagrants.","When he asked me, with obvious self-satisfaction, what I thought of the scenario, I hardly knew how to answer. I asked if he had seen the play and was hardly surprised when he said no."],"Elmore Leonard":["There are cities that get by on their good looks, offer climate and scenery, views of mountains or oceans, rockbound or with palm trees. And there are cities like Detroit that have to work for a living.","If work was a good thing, the rich would have it all and not let you do it.","When you are developing your style, you avoid weaknesses. I am not good at describing things, so I stay away from it. And if anyone is going to describe anything at all, it's going to be from the point of view of the character, because then I can use his voice, and his attitude will be revealed in the way he describes what he sees.","The truth is that the writers who most influenced me weren't people categorized as crime writers. I'd say I learned more from John O'Hara, who isn't much read today but whose short stories I really admired, and Hemingway, who I think has lasted pretty good.","I think any writer is a fool if he doesn't do it for money. There needs to be some kind of incentive in addition to the project. It all goes together. It's fun to sit there and think of characters and get them into action, then be paid for it. I can't believe it when writers tell me 'I don't want to show my work to anybody'.","Sometimes female characters start out as the wife or girlfriend, but then I realize, 'No, she's the book,' and she becomes a main character. I surrender the book to her.","I do this a lot with names. I'll start with a name, and then for some reason he won't talk much, or he's older than I pictured him just because of a name I give him. So then I finally get the right name, and I can't shut the guy up. This always happens. There's always a character who gives me trouble that way.","Everyone has his own sound. I'm not going to presume how to tell anybody how to write.","I try to leave out the parts readers skip.","I get letters. I get several a week, I think. A lot of people want a picture, a lot of people just want an autograph.","There are some people who have been reading me for years, and they keep saying kind things about the writing. That's what you're writing for, to get people to respond to it.","I really - I don't take my work that seriously, and I think that's what keeps me loose. If I try to write, if I catch myself trying to write, I'll fall right on my face. I'll see it. If I see in the prose that I'm - 'Boy, look at me writing,' I rewrite it. I rewrite it because I don't, because I think it's distracting.","I'm not aware of a cadence when writing, but I hear it after. I write in longhand, and that helps. You're closer to it, and you have to cross things out. You put a line through it, but it's still there. You might need it. When you erase a line on a computer, it's gone forever.","Writers - all writers, even screenwriters - like to make their mark. I don't think many screenwriters can write. They pass as writers.","I got halfway through 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.' I don't get it at all. What's the big thrill? It's boring.","When people ask me about my dialogue, I say, 'Don't you hear people talking?' That's all I do. I hear a certain type of individual, I decide this is what he should be, whatever it is, and then I hear him. Well, I don't hear anybody that I can't make talk.","Never open a book with weather. There are exceptions. If you happen to be Barry Lopez, who has more ways to describe ice and snow than an Eskimo, you can do all the weather reporting you want.","I still read Hemingway. I still read his short stories because they're so good. He doesn't waste any words.","If I just sit here, what am I going to do? I don't have a trade. I don't teach or anything. I just love to make up characters and gradually build a story around them.","To me, writing is the most fun. It's not always fun, but finally when you make it come out the way you want, it's then you can say, 'It's fun, boy.'","I decided to write Westerns because there was a terrific market for Westerns in the '50s. There were a lot of pulp magazines, like 'Dime Western' and '10 Story Western' that were still being published. The better ones paid two cents a word. And I thought, 'I like Westerns.'","I want the reader to know what's going on. So there's never a mystery in my books.","A friend of mine who is in the publishing business knew I was writing a book, and he said, 'Have you said anything yet about the good guy? Because I know you spend so much time with the bad guys.' Because they're fun. So then you have to make the good guy fun, in order to compete. That's the challenge.","When I get an idea for a book, something appeals to me, it's usually a character. I'll see a picture of a female marshal in front of the courthouse in Miami and she's got a shotgun on her hip and it goes up on an angle. And she's good-looking. And I say, 'I've got to use her.'","It took me 20 years to buy an electric typewriter, because I was afraid it would be too sensitive. I like to bang the keys. I'm doing action stories, so that's the way I like to do it.","I would say just start writing. You've got to write every day. Copy someone that you like if you think that perhaps could become your sound, too. I did that with Hemingway, and I thought I was writing just like Hemingway. Then all of a sudden it occurred to me - he didn't have a sense of humor. I don't know anything he's written that's funny.","If you take a few days to write an outline, you're just making up scenes that you think will work, that you think will be interesting. But as you write it, other ideas occur - better ideas that have to do with what you're writing.","I never know what I'm going to write next. If I'm still writing the book but I'm very near the end, and I begin to think of what I'd like to do next, then I'll know that what I'm writing is in hand. I'll think of an ending and it will be fine.","The bad guys are the fun guys. The only people I have trouble with are the so-called normal types. Their language isn't very colorful, and they don't talk with any certain sound.","If I have several bad guys and I only want to end up with one of them, then I have to decide which one I want in the end. And normally it's the one who is the most interesting talker.","I have fun writing. I don't make it a chore. I don't have to struggle with it.","I don't want to write any more screenplays, I'll tell you that right now. It's a waste of time. You've got too many people who think they have the answer to a good screenplay and they don't. No one knows.","My purpose is to entertain and please myself. I feel that if I am entertained, then there will be enough other readers who will be entertained, too.","I don't have any of the modern stuff. I don't have e-mail. I don't have a computer!","I left advertising as fast as I could in 1961. And I haven't ever thought about going back.","I think the best advice I give is to try not to write. Try not to overwrite, try not to make it sound too good. Just use your own voice. Use your own style of putting it down.","People ask me, 'Why are you still writing books?' Like I'm still only writing to make money and as soon as I have enough I'll quit and go fishing? I like to write books. It's the most satisfying thing I do.","I'm not going to write for posterity. I'm going to write to make a buck.","Really, when I write a book I'm the only one I have to please. That's the beauty of writing a book instead of a screenplay.","I never see my bad guys as simply bad. They want pretty much the same thing that you and I want: they want to be happy.","My characters have to talk, or they're out. They audition in early scenes. If they can't talk, they're given less to do, or thrown out.","Writing screenplays is not my business. I've written half a dozen, and maybe half of those were made. But it was never a satisfying experience. It was just work. You're an employee. You would be told what to do. Studio execs would cross out my dialogue and put in their dialogue.","I do have fun writing, and a long time ago, I told myself, 'You got to have fun at this, or it'll drive you nuts.'","I think any writer is a fool if he doesn't do it for money. There needs to be some kind of incentive in addition to the project. It all goes together. It's fun to sit there and think of characters and get them into action, then be paid for it.","I don't have any of the modern electronics at all. I know the Internet would be a distraction. I would see things that interested me and never get back to writing.","There are 500 million people on Facebook, but what are they saying to each other? Not much.","I once saw Dizzy Gillespie at a live show, and it made me want to go home immediately and start writing.","I don't get in a position to be frightened. I don't do anything dangerous, and I always pay my bills.","To me, a book is a book, an electronic device is not, and love of books was the reason I started writing.","I can write anywhere. But I don't use a computer, and I could never write on a laptop. I hate the sound of computers; it's too dull, like it's not doing anything for you.","I used to be able to write five pages a day, every day, no problem. Now a good day is five or four pages, and that's from 9:30 A.M. until 6 P.M.","Writing on the beach is not what it's cracked up to be. The sand blows, and you perspire, and the page gets all blotty and messed up, so I don't do that anymore.","I don't believe in writer's block or waiting for inspiration. If you're a writer, you sit down and write."],"Elodie Clouvel":["Obviously, swimming is my strength, but I'm also good at fencing.","Pentathlon is not a sign of my failure in swimming. It's a new start for me.","Fencing and shooting kind of came naturally. From the start, I knew that I had it in me.","I'd like to do some modelling. But I will go on with pentathlon until the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro."],"Elodie Yung":["A first love is something that lasts forever in your heart. It's something that marks you.","This is not the story of Elektra from the comics. We're telling the story of 'Daredevil.' In this aspect, the storylines accentuate the sociopathic tendencies in her. The writers wanted to highlight that Elektra is quite manipulative and doesn't seem to have a conscience.","For me, being comfortable is the best way to express my personality. Some days I like to be chill and wear my Stan Smiths with a cool little jacket, a blouse, and some lipstick for night, and that's it.","You want to enjoy your night, and you don't want to suffer in your heels too long. Lipstick compensates for the lack of heels. It's a good option, and it works.","I think acting is a work of imagination.","The Asian culture has to be a part of what we see on TV and in movies.","Personally, I've always had to face casting directors or producers saying, 'You're right for the part, but nahh, you're not quite what we're looking for.'","When I was auditioning, I didn't know it was 'Daredevil.' Everything was secret. They're secret agents. They wouldn't give you any clues. I was a big fan of the show, and I think it helped me, once I got the part, to really understand the world that they live in. It helped me during shooting.","I've experienced all the food and restaurants in New Orleans. I've been doing a bit of touristing when I have the day off, just walking in the French Quarter. To me, it's very, very surprising how people are so friendly. But no, it's very different from Paris.","I don't see myself as exotic.","When I was nine, my father said 'You can take piano lessons or do karate' - I had a black belt and was competing before I was 19.","I would love to appear in 'The Defenders.' I don't know - because hopefully she'll maybe be on the bad side. I don't know - I don't know what they'd do with Elektra in 'The Defenders,' but that would be a good dynamic, I think - to be confronted by these four superheroes, and I think it would be interesting - I'd be curious to see what they do.","I'm a black belt in karate. I grew up on the outskirts of Paris, and it was rough.","I don't carry sai blades for the sake of it in my personal life. I had to learn how to manipulate the sais. It was very tricky, because it's a weird shape. It's like a big fork. There's a lot of ways that you can use them, but it's not like a sword.","I never do things fearing I could do right or wrong. I just do it because I just follow my guts. This is really how I did it for 'Elektra' because I was just amazed by all the comics. I was good for me to get inspired by them, and I just follow my guts for the rest.","Some of the writers definitely got inspired by some of the story lines, but we are evolving in the 'Daredevil' story. So when it comes to 'Elektra', they didn't follow one of her specific story lines, you know. They really tried to capture what comes through the comics, but there's not one specific storyline.","It's been great to travel because I really enjoyed being 'Elektra', so it's not a problem talking about it.","We can list a bunch of actors who have embodied characters that aren't their nationalities, and I think that's the beauty of acting.","On paper, I refuse to position myself as a victim and say, 'Oh, see, this is hard for me, and I'm never going to get any work because they're never gonna look for a half-French, half-Cambodian girl.' I've always said, 'Carry on and work on your job, and at some point, it'll come.'","Marvel's very secretive, and I'm not hiding anything, I'm not lying; it's just the way they are.","Elektra isn't a villain and isn't a good girl, but as Frank Miller said, she is one of the villains with a weak streak in them, and that's a failure that I tried to explore.","I didn't want to make a caricature version of Elektra.","That's the Elektra I tried to portray: one that's always in the grey. She is a tortured soul.","I had no idea who Elektra was. When the producers asked me before I booked the job, I had to tell them. It was a great surprise when I actually got the job.","I got 'Elektra: Assassin,' and that's where I learned that she was a tortured soul. She's been through a lot and was possibly psychologically unstable.","I learned about the psychology behind Elektra and that excited me. And then I read the 'Daredevil' comics, especially when they met because I wanted to get an understanding of the relationship between Elektra and Matthew.","We're telling the story of 'Daredevil'. In this aspect, the storylines accentuate the sociopathic tendencies in her. The writers wanted to highlight that Elektra is quite manipulative and doesn't seem to have a conscience.","I really think I tried to capture the essence of the comics: what I thought would be the essence of Elektra. And then, as any character that I play, I really tried to dig inside me and try to reach real emotions and transpose that in her world, in who she is.","You can't identify 100% with your character.","Elektra met Matt, and she fell in love with him. And I think he brought some good out of her at some point in her life, and maybe she wants to figure out, by coming back to him, who she really is. She comes back because she misses him, and she's alone, and the only person she's ever loved is Matt.","I wanted to have some disdain in the way that she fights sometimes, because I think Elektra is a bit careless, like, 'You're in my way - get out.'","I'm a girl, so I didn't really know about 'G.I. Joe' as a kid. I didn't watch the show.","No, I'm not a student of Snake Eyes, but we trained in the same dojo.","I did a bit of karate - I'm a blackbelt - so I know how to move.","I'd guess that every American action film would be different. It's just training, training hard, training a lot. Then trying to give your best performance on the day, and I've been lucky so far.","I always work with a coach. That's just a personal thing that I like to do. During interviews, you'll hear more of my accent, and I'll stress the wrong words.","For Elektra, I just wanted to be very clear. She's traveled the world. She didn't go to boarding school, but that's the type of girl that she'd be. So, I just wanted to make sure that I could bring that to her, which goes through the language.","I'm lucky to play Elektra. So far, it's the most exciting part I've ever had to play. I've done the physicality a bit before, and I enjoy it.","I've done some movies before when you have months, or three weeks at least, to train and to learn choreography.","I would ask to tweak stuff during the action, because I thought Elektra would more likely express herself with a slap, for example. I wanted to keep the characteristics of my character even during the fights and express the violence as she would do it, not like somebody else would.","It's not often that I'm being called femme fatale.","I do feel privileged to play Elektra, because definitely she is a strong female character. She's a strong character. It would be nice if eventually we'd just say she's a strong character, not a strong female character.","I love Elektra. I really have a special place in my heart for her. It was very enjoyable for me to discover her and to adapt her for this project and bring myself to this character. So I have a special spot for her.","Having my own show - it's not something that I think of. It's not.","I think I would choose to do things because they are interesting, because I like a character or because it's very well-written. Or because it makes sense."],"Eloise Mumford":["I think the point of art is to be controversial in a lot of ways. It's to cause conversations, and it's to get people excited about and talking about the things that the films are about.","We're used to shooting our own stuff on our cellphones. We're used to capturing everything.","I have had a lot of training as an actor, but it's very different than being on set.","My dad's a scientist, and my mom's a teacher, so I didn't grow up in a family that was into the entertainment world at all.","I think the best thing you can hope for, as you continue on, is to learn so much from every job."],"Eloise Wellings":["I wouldn't take any of my injuries back; I feel like I'm stronger as an athlete because of all those setbacks.","I've been reading 'The Sisterhood,' and I love the author Bobbie Houston and what she's about. It's the whole idea of women celebrating each other's wins and journeying through life together.","I started Little Athletics when I was five years old, but my Olympics dream started when I was 10 years old.","There's nothing more powerful than to consider why you're running, no matter what pain you're going through during the race, if you know why you're running, then it'll be more satisfying at the end.","London was my first Olympics, but I tried for three beforehand. I was measured for the Olympic uniform three times before London, and I finally made the team. It was a big deal, and it was quite emotional, which is probably one of the reasons I didn't perform at my best.","I went to London and was excited to make the team, but to be honest, I was a bit dissatisfied with my performance there, and I'd really like to make up for that in Rio and get the best out of myself on the Olympic stage.","I know that's definitely the way for me to run races - instead of trying to burn up at the front and blowing up, it's always better to be passing people at the end.","I feel like God's given me a gift in running and the opportunity to use running as a platform to help highlight the work of the Love Mercy Foundation in northern Uganda.","I could pretty much live anywhere in the world as long as I'm with my family."],"Elon Musk":["When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor.","I think it's very important to have a feedback loop, where you're constantly thinking about what you've done and how you could be doing it better. I think that's the single best piece of advice: constantly think about how you could be doing things better and questioning yourself.","Life is too short for long-term grudges.","Patience is a virtue, and I'm learning patience. It's a tough lesson.","If you get up in the morning and think the future is going to be better, it is a bright day. Otherwise, it's not.","Some people don't like change, but you need to embrace change if the alternative is disaster.","I'm interested in things that change the world or that affect the future and wondrous, new technology where you see it, and you're like, 'Wow, how did that even happen? How is that possible?'","To make an embarrassing admission, I like video games. That's what got me into software engineering when I was a kid. I wanted to make money so I could buy a better computer to play better video games - nothing like saving the world.","We're running the most dangerous experiment in history right now, which is to see how much carbon dioxide the atmosphere... can handle before there is an environmental catastrophe.","If you're trying to create a company, it's like baking a cake. You have to have all the ingredients in the right proportion.","If something's important enough, you should try. Even if you - the probable outcome is failure.","Great companies are built on great products.","I would like to die on Mars. Just not on impact.","People should pursue what they're passionate about. That will make them happier than pretty much anything else.","There have to be reasons that you get up in the morning and you want to live. Why do you want to live? What's the point? What inspires you? What do you love about the future? If the future does not include being out there among the stars and being a multi-planet species, I find that incredibly depressing.","Any product that needs a manual to work is broken.","I think it matters whether someone has a good heart.","There's a silly notion that failure's not an option at NASA. Failure is an option here. If things are not failing, you are not innovating enough.","I really do encourage other manufacturers to bring electric cars to market. It's a good thing, and they need to bring it to market and keep iterating and improving and make better and better electric cars, and that's what going to result in humanity achieving a sustainable transport future. I wish it was growing faster than it is.","I think we are at the dawn of a new era in commercial space exploration.","I don't spend my time pontificating about high-concept things; I spend my time solving engineering and manufacturing problems.","When I was in college, I wanted to be involved in things that would change the world.","When Henry Ford made cheap, reliable cars people said, 'Nah, what's wrong with a horse?' That was a huge bet he made, and it worked.","I think you should always bear in mind that entropy is not on your side.","Mars is the only place in the solar system where it's possible for life to become multi-planetarian.","Brand is just a perception, and perception will match reality over time. Sometimes it will be ahead, other times it will be behind. But brand is simply a collective impression some have about a product.","I think it's very important to have a feedback loop, where you're constantly thinking about what you've done and how you could be doing it better.","If you want to grow a giant redwood, you need to make sure the seeds are ok, nurture the sapling, and work out what might potentially stop it from growing all the way along. Anything that breaks it at any point stops that growth.","I think that's the single best piece of advice: constantly think about how you could be doing things better and questioning yourself.","I do think there is a lot of potential if you have a compelling product and people are willing to pay a premium for that. I think that is what Apple has shown. You can buy a much cheaper cell phone or laptop, but Apple's product is so much better than the alternative, and people are willing to pay that premium.","An asteroid or a supervolcano could certainly destroy us, but we also face risks the dinosaurs never saw: An engineered virus, nuclear war, inadvertent creation of a micro black hole, or some as-yet-unknown technology could spell the end of us.","Really, the only thing that makes sense is to strive for greater collective enlightenment.","I do love email. Wherever possible I try to communicate asynchronously. I'm really good at email.","Rockets are cool. There's no getting around that.","Silicon Valley has evolved a critical mass of engineers and venture capitalists and all the support structure - the law firms, the real estate, all that - that are all actually geared toward being accepting of startups.","The path to the CEO's office should not be through the CFO's office, and it should not be through the marketing department. It needs to be through engineering and design.","SpaceX is only 12 years old now. Between now and 2040, the company's lifespan will have tripled. If we have linear improvement in technology, as opposed to logarithmic, then we should have a significant base on Mars, perhaps with thousands or tens of thousands of people.","People work better when they know what the goal is and why. It is important that people look forward to coming to work in the morning and enjoy working.","Yeah, well I think anyone who likes fast cars will love the Tesla. And it has fantastic handling by the way. I mean this car will crush a Porsche on the track, just crush it. So if you like fast cars, you'll love this car. And then oh, by the way, it happens to be electric and it's twice the efficiency of a Prius.","The future of humanity is going to bifurcate in two directions: Either it's going to become multiplanetary, or it's going to remain confined to one planet and eventually there's going to be an extinction event.","If humanity doesn't land on Mars in my lifetime, I would be very disappointed.","My vision is for a fully reusable rocket transport system between Earth and Mars that is able to re-fuel on Mars - this is very important - so you don't have to carry the return fuel when you go there.","I think the high-tech industry is used to developing new things very quickly. It's the Silicon Valley way of doing business: You either move very quickly and you work hard to improve your product technology, or you get destroyed by some other company.","America is the spirit of human exploration distilled.","Nobody wants to buy a $60,000 electric Civic. But people will pay $90,000 for an electric sports car.","I say something, and then it usually happens. Maybe not on schedule, but it usually happens.","I usually describe myself as an engineer; that's basically what I've been doing since I was a kid.","My opinion is it's a bridge too far to go to fully autonomous cars.","I think we have a duty to maintain the light of consciousness to make sure it continues into the future.","Physics is really figuring out how to discover new things that are counterintuitive, like quantum mechanics. It's really counterintuitive.","I'm glad to see that BMW is bringing an electric car to market. That's cool.","If you don't have sustainable energy, you have unsustainable energy. The fundamental value of a company like Tesla is the degree to which it accelerates the advent of sustainable energy faster than it would otherwise occur.","Land on Mars, a round-trip ticket - half a million dollars. It can be done.","The fuel cell is just a fundamentally inferior way of delivering electrical energy to an electric motor than batteries.","The space shuttle was often used as an example of why you shouldn't even attempt to make something reusable. But one failed experiment does not invalidate the greater goal. If that was the case, we'd never have had the light bulb.","I've actually made a prediction that within 30 years a majority of new cars made in the United States will be electric. And I don't mean hybrid, I mean fully electric.","It's not as though we can keep burning coal in our power plants. Coal is a finite resource, too. We must find alternatives, and it's a better idea to find alternatives sooner then wait until we run out of coal, and in the meantime, put God knows how many trillions of tons of CO2 that used to be buried underground into the atmosphere.","I think life on Earth must be about more than just solving problems... It's got to be something inspiring, even if it is vicarious.","We could definitely make a flying car - but that's not the hard part. The hard part is, how do you make a flying car that's super safe and quiet? Because if it's a howler, you're going to make people very unhappy.","There have only been about a half dozen genuinely important events in the four-billion-year saga of life on Earth: single-celled life, multicelled life, differentiation into plants and animals, movement of animals from water to land, and the advent of mammals and consciousness.","Government isn't that good at rapid advancement of technology. It tends to be better at funding basic research. To have things take off, you've got to have commercial companies do it.","From an evolutionary standpoint, human consciousness has not been around very long. A little light just went on after four and a half billion years. How often does that happen? Maybe it is quite rare.","It's OK to have your eggs in one basket as long as you control what happens to that basket.","If you go back a few hundred years, what we take for granted today would seem like magic - being able to talk to people over long distances, to transmit images, flying, accessing vast amounts of data like an oracle. These are all things that would have been considered magic a few hundred years ago.","The problem is that at a lot of big companies, process becomes a substitute for thinking. You're encouraged to behave like a little gear in a complex machine. Frankly, it allows you to keep people who aren't that smart, who aren't that creative.","The value of beauty and inspiration is very much underrated, no question. But I want to be clear: I'm not trying to be anyone's savior. I'm just trying to think about the future and not be sad.","It is definitely true that the fundamental enabling technology for electric cars is lithium-ion as a cell chemistry technology. In the absence of that, I don't think it's possible to make an electric car that is competitive with a gasoline car.","The United States is definitely ahead in culture of innovation. If someone wants to accomplish great things, there is no better place than the U.S.","For all the supporters of Tesla over the years, and it's been several years now and there have been some very tough times, I'd just like to say thank you very much. I deeply appreciate the support, particularly through the darkest times.","I had so many people try to talk me out of starting a rocket company, it was crazy.","I tend to approach things from a physics framework. And physics teaches you to reason from first principles rather than by analogy.","If you think back to the beginning of cell phones, laptops or really any new technology, it's always expensive.","The factory is the machine that builds the machine.","Trying to read our DNA is like trying to understand software code - with only 90% of the code riddled with errors. It's very difficult in that case to understand and predict what that software code is going to do.","The odds of me coming into the rocket business, not knowing anything about rockets, not having ever built anything, I mean, I would have to be insane if I thought the odds were in my favor.","Obviously Tesla is about helping solve the consumption of energy in a sustainable manner, but you need the production of energy in a sustainable manner.","The reason we should do a carbon tax is because it's the right thing to do. It's economics 101, elementary stuff.","In order for us to have a future that's exciting and inspiring, it has to be one where we're a space-bearing civilization.","A utility can handle up to 20% of production from solar and that helps the grid because it produces electricity when needed. Solar power peaks in the middle of the day and that's also when air conditioning is running and businesses are operating, so power production matches usage.","It is theoretically possible to warp spacetime itself, so you're not actually moving faster than the speed of light, but it's actually space that's moving.","I've been to Disneyland, like, 10 times. I'm getting really tired of Disneyland.","I've actually not read any books on time management.","You need to live in a dome initially, but over time you could terraform Mars to look like Earth and eventually walk around outside without anything on... So it's a fixer-upper of a planet.","In the early days of aviation, there was a great deal of experimentation and a high death rate.","I'm trying to construct a world that maximises the probability that SpaceX continues its mission without me.","Self-driving cars are the natural extension of active safety and obviously something we should do.","A battery by definition is a collection of cells. So the cell is a little can of chemicals. And the challenge is taking a very high-energy cell, and a large number of them, and combining them safely into a large battery.","If you look at space companies, they've failed either because they've had a technical solution where success was not a possible outcome, they were unable to attract a critical mass of talent, or they just ran out of money. The finish line is usually a lot further away than you think.","I'm a Silicon Valley guy. I just think people from Silicon Valley can do anything.","I was born in Africa. I came to California because it's really where new technologies can be brought to fruition, and I don't see a viable competitor.","The goal of Tesla is to accelerate sustainable energy, so we're going to take a step back and think about what's most likely to achieve that goal.","I don't create companies for the sake of creating companies, but to get things done.","I hate writing about personal stuff. I don't have a Facebook page. I don't use my Twitter account. I am familiar with both, but I don't use them.","Tesla is here to stay and keep fighting for the electric car revolution.","Stationary storage will be as big as the car business long term. The growth rate will probably be several times what it is for the car business.","The reality is gas prices should be much more expensive then they are because we're not incorporating the true damage to the environment and the hidden costs of mining oil and transporting it to the U.S. Whenever you have an unpriced externality, you have a bit of a market failure, to the degree that eternality remains unpriced.","What I'm trying to do is, is to make a significant difference in space flight. And help make space flight accessible to almost anyone.","I think a lot of the American people feel more than a little disappointed that the high-water mark for human exploration was 1969. The dream of human space travel has almost died for a lot of people.","I just want to retire before I go senile because if I don't retire before I go senile, then I'll do more damage than good at that point.","Biofuels such as ethanol require enormous amounts of cropland and end up displacing either food crops or natural wilderness, neither of which is good.","What most people know but don't realize they know is that the world is almost entirely solar-powered already. If the sun wasn't there, we'd be a frozen ice ball at three degrees Kelvin, and the sun powers the entire system of precipitation. The whole ecosystem is solar-powered.","Winning 'Motor Trend' Car of the year is probably the closest thing to winning the Oscar or Emmy of the car industry.","There are really two things that have to occur in order for a new technology to be affordable to the mass market. One is you need economies of scale. The other is you need to iterate on the design. You need to go through a few versions.","A company is a group organized to create a product or service, and it is only as good as its people and how excited they are about creating. I do want to recognize a ton of super-talented people. I just happen to be the face of the companies.","I'd like to dial it back 5% or 10% and try to have a vacation that's not just e-mail with a view.","It's important that we attempt to extend life beyond Earth now. It is the first time in the four billion-year history of Earth that it's been possible, and that window could be open for a long time - hopefully it is - or it could be open for a short time. We should err on the side of caution and do something now.","I always invest my own money in the companies that I create. I don't believe in the whole thing of just using other people's money. I don't think that's right. I'm not going to ask other people to invest in something if I'm not prepared to do so myself.","If you look at our current technology level, something strange has to happen to civilisations, and I mean strange in a bad way. And it could be that there are a whole lot of dead, one-planet civilisations.","We polled Tesla owners, do you want autopilot disabled or not. Not one person wanted it disabled. That's pretty telling.","I wouldn't say I have a lack of fear. In fact, I'd like my fear emotion to be less because it's very distracting and fries my nervous system.","Facebook is quite entrenched and has a network effect. It's hard to break into a network once it's formed.","As you heat the planet up, it's just like boiling a pot.","Automotive franchise laws were put in place decades ago to prevent a manufacturer from unfairly opening stores in direct competition with an existing franchise dealer that had already invested time, money and effort to open and promote their business.","I think there are more politicians in favor of electric cars than against. There are still some that are against, and I think the reasoning for that varies depending on the person, but in some cases, they just don't believe in climate change - they think oil will last forever.","My background educationally is physics and economics, and I grew up in sort of an engineering environment - my father is an electromechanical engineer. And so there were lots of engineery things around me.","I'm anti-tax, but I'm pro-carbon tax.","I think Tesla will most likely develop its own autopilot system for the car, as I think it should be camera-based, not Lidar-based. However, it is also possible that we do something jointly with Google.","With DNA, you have to be able to tell which genes are turned on or off. Current DNA sequencing cannot do that. The next generation of DNA sequencing needs to be able to do this. If somebody invents this, then we can start to very precisely identify cures for diseases.","Boeing just took $20 billion and 10 years to improve the efficiency of their planes by 10 percent. That's pretty lame. I have a design in mind for a vertical liftoff supersonic jet that would be a really big improvement.","I think most of the important stuff on the Internet has been built. There will be continued innovation, for sure, but the great problems of the Internet have essentially been solved.","If anyone thinks they'd rather be in a different part of history, they're probably not a very good student of history. Life sucked in the old days. People knew very little, and you were likely to die at a young age of some horrible disease. You'd probably have no teeth by now. It would be particularly awful if you were a woman.","It's obviously tricky to convert cellulose to a useful biofuel. I think actually the most efficient way to use cellulose is to burn it in a co-generation power plant. That will yield the most energy and that is something you can do today.","I feel very strongly that SpaceX would not have been able to get started, nor would we have made the progress that we have, without the help of NASA.","Silicon Valley has some of the smartest engineers and technology business people in the world.","You need to be in the position where it is the cost of the fuel that actually matters and not the cost of building the rocket in the first place.","Some companies out there quote a start of production that is substantially in advance of when customers get their cars.","I think long term you can see Tesla establishing factories in Europe, in other parts of the U.S. and in Asia.","I don't think it's a good idea to plan to sell a company.","There are some important differences between me and Tony Stark, like I have five kids, so I spend more time going to Disneyland than parties.","I like the word 'autopilot' more than I like the word 'self-driving.' 'Self-driving' sounds like it's going to do something you don't want it to do. 'Autopilot' is a good thing to have in planes, and we should have it in cars.","In order to have your voice be heard in Washington, you have to make some little contribution.","It would take six months to get to Mars if you go there slowly, with optimal energy cost. Then it would take eighteen months for the planets to realign. Then it would take six months to get back, though I can see getting the travel time down to three months pretty quickly if America has the will.","The revolutionary breakthrough will come with rockets that are fully and rapidly reusable. We will never conquer Mars unless we do that. It'll be too expensive. The American colonies would never have been pioneered if the ships that crossed the ocean hadn't been reusable.","The U.S. automotive industry has been selling cars the same way for over 100 years, and there are many laws in place to govern exactly how that is to be accomplished.","Even if producing CO2 was good for the environment, given that we're going to run out of hydrocarbons, we need to find some sustainable means of operating.","If we drive down the cost of transportation in space, we can do great things.","Selling an electric sports car creates an opportunity to fundamentally change the way America drives.","A Prius is not a true hybrid, really. The current Prius is, like, 2 percent electric. It's a gasoline car with slightly better mileage.","I would like to fly in space. Absolutely. That would be cool. I used to just do personally risky things, but now I've got kids and responsibilities, so I can't be my own test pilot. That wouldn't be a good idea. But I definitely want to fly as soon as it's a sensible thing to do.","If anyone has a vested interest in space solar power, it would have to be me.","I'm personally a moderate and a registered independent, so I'm not strongly Democratic or strongly Republican.","You could warm Mars up, over time, with greenhouse gases.","There's nothing - I've bought everything I want. I don't like yachts or anything; you know, I'm not a yacht person, and I've got pretty much the nicest plane I'd want to have.","Tesla is becoming a real car company.","The rumours of the demise of the U.S. manufacturing industry are greatly exaggerated.","I'm reasonably optimistic about the future, especially the future of the United States - for the century, at least.","In the case of Apple, they did originally do production internally, but then along came unbelievably good outsourced manufacturing from companies like Foxconn. We don't have that in the rocket business. There's no Foxconn in the rocket business.","If you had to buy a new plane every time you flew somewhere, it would be incredibly expensive.","SpaceX has the potential of saving the U.S. government $1 billion a year. We are opposed to creating an entrenched monopoly with no realistic means for anyone to compete.","The lessons of history would suggest that civilisations move in cycles. You can track that back quite far - the Babylonians, the Sumerians, followed by the Egyptians, the Romans, China. We're obviously in a very upward cycle right now, and hopefully that remains the case. But it may not.","If we could do high-speed rail in California just half a notch above what they've done on the Shanghai line in China, and if we had a straight path from L.A. to San Francisco, as well as the milk run, at least that would be progress.","Here in the West, people often don't like listening to their leaders, even if they are right.","If we're going to have any chance of sending stuff to other star systems, we need to be laser-focused on becoming a multi-planet civilisation.","So we originally expected to make about 35 gigawatt hours at the cell level and about 50 gigawatt hours at the module or pack level. Now we are expecting to do about 150 gigawatt hours in the same volumetric space as the original design.","The pace of progress on Mars depends upon the pace of progress of SpaceX.","Over time I think we will probably see a closer merger of biological intelligence and digital intelligence."],"Els Borst":["If everything is God's will, then so is the invention of the vaccine, just like the seatbelt.","If I had been prime minister, I would have offered apologies to the Dutch Jewish community without hesitation. This would refer both to our government's attitude during the Second World War and to the very late postwar discovery that the restitution process had been poorly conceived.","I have always lived in Amsterdam. During the war, we inhabited the Rivieren neighborhood where many Jews lived at the time. Our downstairs neighbors were Jews, and there were also Jews a few houses from us. We saw how they were rounded up and taken away. That made a very great impression on me.","My feeling is that if all Catholics or Reformed Christians had been deported to Germany, the Dutch government in London would have instructed the population in the occupied Netherlands to help them.","There are many nice, peaceful Muslims, but the Netherlands is far too tolerant regarding the statements of the radical wing of Islam."],"Elsa Hosk":["I like to be completely exhausted when I go to bed, so if I worked out and I had a long day, that's enough for me. Then I get on the bed and oof! So nice.","I like vintage stores - all over the world. I have a little collection of my favorite stores here and there. Other than that, I love online shopping.","I love fashion, so I'm always into new things. I'm not necessarily a trend-driven person. I like to kind of do my own thing.","I love the 'Victoria's Secret Knockout Front-close Strappy-back Sport Bra.' After a strenuous and sweaty workout, I don't have to pull it over my head to take it off. The front close makes it very convenient and easy, and the strappy back is super sexy!","It was a long time ago: I was 13, and my dad actually sent photos to two different agencies of all of my family, and I had no idea.","I used to hate my butt - like, hate it. In school, I used to cover it up. I felt like it was too big; like, I felt like I needed to wear a sweater over it. It was awful.","Swedish people live for the summer - it transforms everyone. I don't want to miss having a Swedish summer vacation for as long as I live. It's my favorite thing in the world.","On my lips, I just do a little bit of liner, just a color silhouette.","I use argan oil when I have dry ends. A good hair brush, like a Mason Pearson, is great because it doesn't damage the hair. I like Kerastase shampoo and conditioner best.","I love to relax. It's my favorite thing in the world. I am very good at being like a grandma and staying in and watching 'Game of Thrones' or a movie. I think I could do that every night.","Actually, when I say my name in the U.S., people are like 'You're Elsa from Frozen!' And I'm like, I can't break their hearts, 'I could be!'","My favorite part about modeling is probably my least favorite part as well. It's traveling. Because it goes both ways. It's so amazing to get to see the world; we're so fortunate to go to all these places that I would never be in unless I was a model.","I switch my products so much, but right now, I'm really into organic skin care. I hope it's here to stay. I like that whole vibe and just being really gentle with your skin and not putting too much products that are harsh.","I generally always eat what I want. I think when you work out a lot, you can afford to eat more because your body's metabolism is higher. I like healthy food and prefer that anyways, but if I want pizza or a can of Coca-Cola every once in a while, I'm going to have it. I just try to have a few slices, and that's it.","I miss the archipelago, the islands outside of Stockholm, the most. That's where I spent my summers as a kid. Going on a boat and island-hopping. In August, we have a crayfish party.","Boxing makes you kind of tight, so it's really good to mix that with barre, Pilates, or something that'll stretch you out and make you longer. I'm not the person that loves to be in the gym so much. I like to mix it up as much as possible; otherwise, I'll get bored.","I love 'Victoria's Secret Sport' because what they do so well is the fit and how it makes you feel. They sculpt all the right parts of your body. Plus, there's so much to choose from - colors, prints, and cool details. It's dangerous - you want everything.","I have so many indulgences - way too many. But I think also you work out to be able to eat what you want. You can be healthy, but you have to let yourself live.","I think life is so much about enjoying and not punishing yourself or restricting yourself too much. The more I let go of all my rules, the more free and happy I am, and nothing happens. So I just enjoy.","Sleep is so important. I think more important than we know. When I haven't slept, I'm not myself. I'm not as easy-going.","I like a good mattress, first of all. I have a Hestia bed, and it's the best mattress in the world. I like it pretty cold because I can't sleep when it's really hot.","I fall asleep to a movie every night! I don't have a go-to movie, but I like Netflix or whatever I can find. Usually, it's just noise in the background; I think it's damage from living in New York, where it's so noisy.","Playing sports is great when you're young. It teaches you how to focus, how to direct your energy, how not to think about a million other things that are going on.","When I work out, I make healthier choices in all areas of life, and when I don't, I tend to slack on other things, too, so I like to keep a good routine going.","Josie Maran anything! Love her products, especially the argan sun block moisturizer, and RMS beauty anything, always. Her eye polish colors are insane. I also always keep an Eau So Sexy rollerball by Victoria's Secret in my bag.","I like a good cleanse in the morning, and I use 'Cetaphil', which is cheap but really works.","In the daytime during the summer, I only wear 'Laura Mercier Secret Camouflage Concealer' for coverage. I keep that in my bag at all times. I love 'RMS Buriti Bronzer' because it has a little bit of red in it, and my skin is on the reddish side, so it matches really well.","Black liner looks harsh on me because I'm so blond, so I do a brown liner with a black mascara. My favorite is 'L'Oreal Voluminous' on my top and bottom lashes. For a while, I only did mascara on the upper lashes, but it makes me look too pretty.","You're in a bathing suit pretty much all year round working for Victoria's Secret. There's so many shoots, and we're always in lingerie, so you kinda always have to be prepared and ready.","Just knowing how the body works and being athletic means it's easier to stay athletic while working a different job.","Just having the whole control over your body is so important when you're modelling - to just be able to know exactly what you look like and what you're doing.","I have a boxing trainer at a gym, which is really fun. And I also try to complement it with flybarre, which is lengthening, strengthening, toning, just tightening everything up.","Being a model, you're constantly judged on the way you look, but I think you have to be really strong and confident in knowing who you are and not take anything personally, you know, because not everybody can like you, and not everybody will think you're beautiful.","All-time favorite workout is basketball. It's very hard to do basketball training, though, but it's my favorite.","My dad put up a basket on my street, and I was practicing every day. It was just nuts. But I miss it. Whenever I see a ball, I get itchy!","I would never wear a look that was all the same designer. I always wear at least one thing that is vintage. I dress according to my mood, and I usually spend money on the basics, like leather jackets, handbags, sweaters and shoes.","Being the face of 'Pink' is the greatest gig ever. The company has become like a little family for me in N.Y.C. I am constantly working with new people, and every day feels like the first day of school.","It has taken me so long to understand my skin, but the formula that works best for me is, gentle and less is more. But I do cleanse my skin well at night with a good natural cleanser by Dr. Hauschka or Avalon Organics.","My hair gets very light in the summer, but the problem with using all these products and going into the pool a lot is that my hair gets very yellow. I love purple shampoo!","Oh my God, I sweat so much! You have to keep deodorant in your purse and use those deodorising wipes that cool you off a bit.","Don't compare yourself to anybody. I did that a lot when I was younger. I was so insecure about my butt.","When I was growing up, around 14, it wasn't really cool at the time to have a big butt. I would always cover it with sweaters, and I was so ashamed of it. Now I'm like, 'Why would I ever do that? That's awful!' Don't change yourself, and don't try to be anyone who you're not.","Working with Victoria's Secret, it is very celebrated to have curves.","Everyone has their awkward phase. I think everything passes, and that is key to remember - none of us looked like this when we were younger... Everybody grows into themselves, and you learn about yourself.","Right now there are a lot of Angels represented. We are from all over the world. We come from different backgrounds. We all had different lives before this, so it is really interesting how a lot of different nationalities are represented, and it is super cool.","Lots of weight training, squats, a little bit of cardio, but mostly just adding more weights into my workouts. And working out with friends to make it fun. That's always so important.","I try to eat whatever I want. I don't like putting myself on a diet, but I try to eat organic, healthy, and lean with lots of green vegetables.","When I model, I use every single muscle in my body. Being fit and physical lets me know that control.","I know I have one of the best jobs in the world. These days, models are allowed to have bigger personalities and be celebrities on their own.","Natalia Vodianova is a model who always did it right. She was able to just put her personality out there, and I try to do that all the time.","I always do the same makeup because it's what works with my face. Just eyeliner and lots of mascara - very '60s.","My eyeliner is this Kat Von D Tattoo Liner... I've tried every single eyeliner, and this is the best. I use it in Mad Max Brown."],"Elsa Lanchester":["She looked as if butter wouldn't melt in her mouth - or anywhere else.","There is no such thing as a person that nothing has happened to, and each person's story is as different as his fingertips."],"Elsa Maxwell":["Someone said that life is a party. You join in after it's started and leave before it's finished.","Bores put you in a mental cemetery while you are still walking.","A bore is a vacuum cleaner of society, sucking up everything and giving nothing. Bores are always eager to be seen talking to you.","Serve the dinner backward, do anything - but for goodness sake, do something weird.","Under pressure, people admit to murder, setting fire to the village church or robbing a bank, but never to being bores.","I make enemies deliberately. They are the sauce piquante to my dish of life.","I don't hate anyone. I dislike. But my dislike is the equivalent of anyone else's hate.","Existence is a party. You join after its started and you leave before its finished.","Giving parties is a trivial avocation, but it pays the dues for my union card in humanity.","Seeing unhappiness in the marriage of friends, I was content to have chosen music and laughter as a substitute for a husband."],"Elsa Pataky":["Having the person that you love by your side and starting a family with them is the best thing that can happen to you in this life. You can't ask for more.","Exercise is like an addiction. Once you're in it, you feel like your body needs it."],"Elsa Peretti":["I can hold a cup of sake on a full moon in Japan, and the reflection of the moon in that little cup can make me feel so enthusiastic about beauty. That one good, magical moment can give me enough to create other things like the teardrop earring or necklace.","I hate that impeccable, perfectly perfect look, all matched and prearranged.","I am a bull. I am Taurus. My will is awful. If I like something, there is nothing else. I was a pain in the neck. I still am a pain in the neck.","I like Yorkshire Tea - very strong and English.","What I want is not to become a status symbol, but to give beauty at a price.","I was a baby when I began, but I knew exactly what I wanted to wear myself. I became a jewelry designer because I knew how to do something with a pencil and sketch my ideas.","You think about the beauty and what you want to transmit. If I think about designing, I can't design.","I am jewelry and objects together. This is the Elsa Peretti name to me. It is a very good balance for me to try and create with the person in mind or with the space in mind - to imagine a bowl of fruit or something for water. It is a little bit yin and yang.","I like to push myself to achieve a certain quality, eliminate the excess detail. I always want a high degree of purity.","I can't copy nature.","I always write in pencil, so I can erase.","Most of the time, I'm in the country, and the jewelry I wear I can wear in the country.","The production must be faithful to the line. If the production fails, my work fails.","I hated modeling. I was so scared. But as soon as I started doing jewelry, I did better as a model.","In the '80s, everything became too serious.","Bird cages are nothing of incredible value, but I like them.","I don't have the feeling that I need to add a lot to my collection, because I have an incredibly wide range of things. This is a part of the secret of my things, that they are still valid. When I feel a need, I do something more.","For me, to put together my museum and all my remembrances was a big effort mentally, physically and monetarily.","I keep my hair gray, so I like silver and platinum. For women who dye their hair, they can wear whatever they want.","Good design for the home should be universal. A house should be like old shoes, comfortable, like a good friend... The Japanese aesthetic is important to me. Very organic. They have a sense of the weight of the thing: very balanced.","People surround themselves in their houses with things they don't really need, that they have to dust all the time.","A lot of designers still have nostalgia for the past. As for the furniture in the future, I hope they use less of real wood. Conservation in wood is necessary.","I like to do things that are classic.","I design for the working girl.","A big diamond necklace is nouveau riche, really. People who have wealth a long time don't wear such things.","I would like to get married, but it must be a man who is part of my work, or me part of his."],"Elsa Schiaparelli":["Women can learn from men and improve their 'chic.' A man wouldn't think of wearing a tight shoe or one that didn't harmonize with his suit.","There are times to be casual and times to be correct. It's all right to wear a sweater and slacks on a picnic, but they don't belong in the theater or the drawing room.","Pearls, including cheap ones, are always in good taste.","I get more disgusted with men all the time - particularly traveling Americans. They start out on a trip to Europe and never bother to pack a dinner jacket. This is not only stupid - it's bad manners.","It's not polite to refuse to dress for a parly. It's an insult to your hostess. After all, correct dress is a part of good manners.","In difficult times fashion is always outrageous.","Some women succeed at being strong and also tender, but most of those who have intended to walk alone, making their own way, have lost their happiness.","Before me, everything was black or navy blue or gray or brown or beige, things like that, for daytime. I began using shocking pink and ice blue and all kinds of bright colors. And I dyed furs.","Many men admire strong women, but they don't love them.","I myself used to do absurd things. Yes, I mean that. I had to have a laugh, and some of the things were absurd. But they could always be worn by an elegant woman; they did not negate her elegance.","What Hollywood designs today, you will be wearing tomorrow.","White stockings I do not like. Why does anyone except a schoolgirl want to wear them? Nothing is more flattering to the legs than flesh color.","Eating is not merely a material pleasure. Eating well gives a spectacular joy to life and contributes immensely to goodwill and happy companionship. It is of great importance to the morale.","A good cook is like a sorceress who dispenses happiness.","Never fit a dress to the body but train the body to fit the dress.","Women dress alike all over the world: they dress to be annoying to other women.","Cheap jewelery should never be worn unless it happens to be something that you positively know suits you.","Fortunately, or unforunately for me, I am always at my best when I am unhampered: when I can let myself go and have a little fun.","A successful designer must be a gambler.","You cannot choose beforehand what you want to use for a suit. You may want to change your mind a dozen times before you are through.","I think it is childish for men to joke about women's clothes, to make fun of our hats, to complain over the cost of a good fur coat.","The woman over 50 must be very frank with herself.","I stay out of the sun; it's terrible for the skin of any woman over 35. If you must have a suntan, at least keep moving while you're in the sun.","Russian women are now interested in clothes. But they will never attach supreme importance to fashions as do Europeans and American women, because they are too vitally interested in all the various projects going on in their country.","There are two classes of women in Soviet Russia. There is the professional class, which has taken the place of the nobility and includes government officials, artists, doctors, composers and writers as well as former members of the old nobility whose sympathy is with the Soviets, and also the peasant class.","Man was created to frame the woman.","Men have to be freed from the tortures of heavy clothing that covers everything but the face and hands.","In the building of a basic wardrobe, we cannot go wrong if we strive for simplicity and perfect fitting.","Give a man a chance, and he'll be so casual that he won't bathe, shave, or comb his hair. He'll just depend on his animal magnetism to get him by."],"Elton Gallegly":["You took care of your horse, and your horse took care of you.","In addition, California spends nearly $1 billion a year in Medi-Cal services for an average of 780,000 illegal immigrants a month, over and above emergency health services.","Hospitals are closing across the country due to the burden of illegal immigration, college students find that summer jobs have dried up due to illegal immigration, and wages across the board are depressed by the overwhelming influx of cheap and illegal labor.","The fifth amendment of the U.S. Constitution guarantees that no private property shall be taken for a public use without the payment of just compensation.","As a former mayor, I know that local governments must have control over land use decisions.","Instead, California is one of only 10 states that provides in-state college and university tuition to illegal immigrants. That's grossly unfair to a legal high school student who moves out of California for a year, then returns to attend college.","While a strong presence on our southern border is imperative, the border cannot be secured unless we enforce our internal laws and stop ignoring the open complicity of U.S. companies and foreign nations to promote illegal activities.","Consular cards were not designed to be identification and no treaty recognizes them as such. Legal travelers, visitors and long-term residents carried passports, visas or green cards for that purpose.","Consular offices make no attempt to determine whether the person obtaining the card is legally in the United States. In fact, the only people who need these cards are illegal immigrants, criminals and terrorists. Consular cards also are easily forged.","Every unskilled illegal immigrant who enters the United States for work drives up healthcare costs for every American. And, every illegal immigrant we turn a blind eye toward weakens the rule of law our country is founded on.","We are a nation of immigrants, but we are also a nation of laws.","Since achieving their independence in 1992, the people of Croatia have built a democratic society based on the rule of law, respect for human rights, and a free market economy.","Among other things, the Real ID Act sets minimum security criteria that states would have to meet to have their driver's licenses accepted as identification to board a commercial flight or enter federal facilities.","Consular cards are easily obtained with no proof of true identity and are easily forged.","Congress has greatly tightened the loopholes terrorists can use to harm Americans. We need to do more. We need controls immediately on what forms of ID are adequate to board planes and enter secure sites.","It's been argued that of all the animals humans have domesticated, the horse is the most important to our history. For thousands of years, horses were our most reliable mode of transportation.","Horsemeat in many European and Asian countries is consumed as a delicacy.","More than 65,000 horses were slaughtered in the United States in 2004, a 50 percent increase since 2002.","It is our hope that in future discussions with the Mexican government, you will encourage Mexico to do its part to address illegal immigration rather than encourage their citizens to illegally enter the U.S.","I have great respect for President Bush, Secretary Powell and Secretary Ridge.","President Reagan achieved such successes because when you sat in a room with him, there could be over 1,000 people in the room, yet you felt like there was only the two of you, and his wonderful wit would put you at ease. That was a tremendous gift.","President Reagan is now at rest. We mourn his passing, but we are grateful for the gifts he gave us: a safer world, strong economic base, and a renewed belief in America's greatness."],"Elton John":["I never thought of myself as being handsome or good-looking or whatever.","Music has healing power. It has the ability to take people out of themselves for a few hours.","I never thought of myself as being handsome or good-looking or whatever. I always felt like an outsider.","The great thing about rock and roll is that someone like me can be a star.","I'm not everybody's cup of tea. But sometimes criticism can be hurtful. Be respectful. I'm a good piano player, I can sing well, I write good songs. If you don't like it, fair enough. But give me a break.","I have no one to leave the money to. I'm a single man. I like spending my money.","I think performers are all show-offs anyway, especially musicians. Unless you show off, you're not going to get noticed.","I've always wanted to smash a guitar over someone's head. You just can't do that with a piano.","I've only been interested in the artistic side of life.","If you write great songs with meaning and emotion, they will last for ever because songs are the key to everything. Songs will outlast the artist and they will go on for ever if they are good.","People with HIV are still stigmatized. The infection rates are going up. People are dying. The political response is appalling. The sadness of it, the waste.","I love every minute of fatherhood, staying up all night, changing nappies, kids crying, I find it really funny and inspiring. It connects you to the world in a new way.","I love the idea of the teachings of Jesus Christ and the beautiful stories about it, which I loved in Sunday school and I collected all the little stickers and put them in my book. But the reality is that organised religion doesn't seem to work. It turns people into hateful lemmings and it's not really compassionate.","I think people should be free to engage in any sexual practices they choose; they should draw the line at goats though.","Everything I thought I'd hate about having children - the crying, the screaming - nothing fazes me. I love it all, and it's relaxed me.","And I'm afraid, in this day and age, trust, which I count so, you know, I love loyalty. I love trust.","Well, I was making a record, and I had to choose a name, because they said, you know, you can't make a record under the name of Reg Dwight, because it's never going to - you know, it's not attractive enough.","The great thing about small children is they're portable, so we take them everywhere, but when it comes to 2015, Zachary's going to school, and I want to be there to drop him off and pick him up. I don't want to just be the father who reads them a bedtime story.","We live in an age, in an era where there is so much negativity, there is so much violence in the world, there is so much unrest and people are at war, that I wanted to promote the word love and red signifies love.","Fame attracts lunatics.","I've got that resilient thing inside me. But I wasn't a happy bunny.","I do like Britney Spears. I think she's cute. I think she's fun. And I like her records. You know, I'm not a pop snob whatsoever. I think she makes great pop records.","I grew up at my grandmother's house, and she had a beautiful garden. I used to hate mowing the lawn and weeding, which is what you do when you're a kid. I loathe gardening, but I love gardens, and I have two beautiful gardens.","I was more ashamed that I couldn't work the washing machine than the fact that I was taking drugs.","The whole point of being in this business and being blessed and being successful is that you're able to do things for your friends or your family, which means that they can have something special in their lives, too.","My mum always used to buy a record every Friday.","I'm lucky enough and wealthy enough to be able to buy photographs and buy art that inspires me from day to day. I don't want a Picasso on my wall; it's great art, but it's dead art to me. I'd rather have a photograph by someone I've never heard of that really inspires me.","If there is a better singer in England than Craig David, then I am Margaret Thatcher.","I don't have to compete in the charts. I can just be myself as a musician, a songwriter and play with the musicians that I really love.","The worst thing you can do to a child, and I've seen it happen so many times, is the silver spoon.","I grew up at my grandmother's house and she had a beautiful garden. I used to hate mowing the lawn and weeding, which is what you do when you're a kid.","For me, music is so passionate, I have to give it my all every time I go onstage. Onstage, it was always comfortable for me, because that's where I felt at home.","I could never go onstage in denims.","I'm very generous.","And there's no guarantee that if you get HIV and you take these triple therapies, or whatever comes along next, that they're going to be successful for you.","There is nothing wrong with going to bed with someone of your own sex. People should be very free with sex, they should draw the line at goats.","But you know, I have a pretty good relationship with the press and the paparazzi. It's just when they step over the line that, you know, enough's enough.","When Little Richard used to stand up and play it was just fabulous, and Liberace had the candlesticks and the rings and the gift of the gab. The piano's is the most ungainly rock' n' roll instrument of all time but those two people transcended it, as did Jerry Lee Lewis.","If I was to say what I am, I'd be a Labour man. I like Tony Blair a lot, I think he's a good man. And in America I'd definitely be a Democrat; I'd never be a Republican.","I've always been dead set against festivals - really suspicious and wary.","I rarely wear tennis shoes. I'm 5' 8', I hate being short.","I heard Little Richard and Jerry Lee Lewis, and that was it. I didn't ever want to be anything else. I just started banging away and semi-studied classical music at the Royal Academy of Music but sort of half-heartedly.","When I say I don't have to write pop songs anymore, there's no way I'm going to get on the radio at 60 years of age unless I'm doing a duet with Gaga or I was on 'All of the Lights,' which was a Kanye West record that managed to get on the radio.","When your persona begins to take over your music and becomes more important, you enter a dangerous place. Once you have people around you who don't question you, you're in a dangerous place.","I mean, in some cases with libel laws, you know, they can write things about people who have no course of action, because they can't afford to take legal action against them.","And the danger is - and it's happening - is we're seeing an incredibly big rise amongst young gay people, young heterosexual people as far as catching HIV, which is, you know, in an educated country like this or in Britain, it's frightening.","An agent is a person who is sore because an actor gets 90% of what they make.","Well, as I was saying... everyone's so nice to me, usually.","And I talked to my doctor, and I must admit, you know, I'm sometimes quite renowned for my outbursts and I was just very frustrated, maybe a little frightened.","I used to get my money at the end of the week, buy my mum something, or buy a record, and that was it.","I'm a very wealthy man.","I have a lot of money stashed away, but I do live my life from day to day.","I've got a great collection of photography.","And I trusted someone to look after me on the business side of life.","Well, I'm a huge fan of Ryan Adams, who's from North Carolina. And he's beginning to break really quite big.","I mean, Sting is one of my great buddies and I love him to death.","And I agreed with that, and I couldn't wait to change my name anyway, because I'm not too fond of the name of Reginald. It's a very kind of '50s English name.","We were both very much the same. We were both very impulsive. We both loved life. We both loved shopping. We both had a love of clothes, obviously, because he was the designer that I kind of wore forever and ever.","Well, I've had my fair share in Britain of battling the tabloids.","I have a much better relationship with the press than I did, I think because I stood my ground.","I never really made a full album in Los Angeles before.","I've got to do something to make up for all those self-absorbed and selfish years when I just, you know, was taking drugs, sitting in my room, doing bad things, whatever.","Yeah. I have been with David Furnish for eight years, now.","Because, I figured that, because I was a successful man, I was wealthy, I was, you know, seemingly intelligent - even that I am not intelligent enough to ask for help.","I am the most well-known homosexual in the world.","Who really needs a new album from me?","Bands today have to learn their craft by putting the hard work in that we did when we were young performers.","I love places that have an incredible history. I love the Italian way of life. I love the food. I love the people. I love the attitudes of Italians.","I am such a Luddite when it comes to making music. All I can do is write at the piano.","I loathe celebrity. I can't stand it.","Jesus wanted us to be loving and forgiving.","There's a lot of hate in the world.","As Elton John, my days on pop radio are over, and I know that and I accept it and I'm not unhappy about it.","I've had an amazing professional life, personal life, but at 64 to have a son who gives us that much love and enjoyment is, wow!","There's no pressure for me to go out there and say, I've got to have a top 40 hit because it's not going to happen.","I do work a lot. I mean, most of my income, I would say, comes from live performances. And then you've got publishing, you've got record royalties.","The thing about Vegas is, I don't have to fly anywhere, and that really helps. It means I stay in one place for three weeks at a time instead of flying backwards and forwards.","I loathe gardening, but I love gardens, and I have two beautiful gardens. I can not bear gardening, but I love gardens.","I grew up conservative because my mum was a conservative, and when I finally realized what conservatives were, I changed my mind immediately.","I went to a mixed school and I can't remember being bullied at school, ever. I was quite large, in those days. Usually, if you're going to be a bully, you'll pick on someone who is small. I didn't bully anybody, and I don't remember being bullied.","I was just genuinely shy. I'd always been a shy kid.","I just go into the studio, look at the lyrics for the first time when I put them on the piano, and go. If I haven't got it within 40 minutes, I give up. It's never changed, the thrill has never gone, because I don't know what I'm going to get next.","I'm addicted to working. I mean, I have a list of 100 countries I want to play in. I'm basically killing myself by travelling so much, for no reason whatsoever.","I've never been jealous of anybody's success. I've been flummoxed by it because I don't understand it, but I'm not jealous of it.","As a child, as a teenager, I was kind of not allowed to wear fashionable clothes.","When people go to rehab and come out, they go through a difficult period, but I never had that.","I've never had a writer's block, but still I think: 'Is it going to happen this time?' You never know what you're going to get; you just put your fingers on the keys and hope.","I'm very relaxed. I have a family, I have a partner of 20 years, I have a wonderful life; nothing could be better.","Once I'd heard 'Modern Times' by Bob Dylan, it really changed the way I wanted to make records.","I'd always lived with people - my family, or had people living with me, because I'd never liked being on my own.","I tour as many countries as possible, and I've toured every state in America, plus every province in Canada.","It's just so wonderful to have someone in the house like a child to turn your attention to. It's not about you anymore, it's about this lovely little human being.","Simon Cowell and I are great friends, and we wind each other up. Rod Stewart and I do the same thing.","Jesus wanted us to be loving and forgiving. I don't know what makes people so cruel.","I grew up conservative because my mum was a conservative, and when I finally realized what conservatives were, I changed my mind immediately. As children, we tend to copy our parents.","I'm a great lover of children. I never thought that one day I'd actually be a father, but I'm very pleased that I changed my mind. Children are extremely important. They are the future of the world.","I'm so proud to be on a Kate Bush record; she's always marched to the beat of her own drum.","At heart I've always been a music fan. That part of me has never changed since I was a little kid, sitting in a room watching a record go round, looking at the colour of the labels.","I do like my rock stars to be a little larger than life. I don't mind the earnest ones at all, but I do like a bit of individuality.","I am the biggest technophobe of all time.","I hate to say this, but I always listen to the music and the instrumentation first, and then grab on to the lyrics later.","I am so in the past. I'm such a Luddite when it comes to making music. All I can do is write at the piano."],"Elvis Costello":["'Content' is a word that has never sat well with me. Like 'maturity'. They are two words I've never liked. I think they imply some sort of decay. A settling.","I used to be disgusted; now I try to be amused.","You have to face the fact that I have no reputation as a composer; I have my reputation as a songwriter and a performer-and that opportunity came this summer, when I was invited to perform at the Lincoln Centre festival in New York... three nights.","You need a platform upon which to release an orchestral record, otherwise it's just going to be an obscurity.","Happiness isn't a fortune in a cookie. It's deeper, wider, funnier, and more transporting than that.","Life for me is about movement.","And over the last ten years, after my work with the Brodsky Quartet, I had the opportunity to write arrangements for chamber group, chamber orchestra, jazz orchestra, symphony orchestra even.","I find humming is very useful.","These are the sort of things that push you on in music - the curiosity, a passion for new ideas.","My ultimate vocation in life is to be an irritant.","I believe that music is connected by human passions and curiosities rather than by marketing strategies.","We're all just animals. That's all we are, and everything else is just an elaborate justification of our instincts. That's where music comes from. And romantic poetry. And bad novels.","And I don't feel any form of music is beyond me in the sense of that I don't understand it or I don't have some love for some part of it.","The Internet is overrated. It's much smaller an innovation than people think it is. I don't think it's changed the way anybody makes music.","There's no such thing as an original sin.","And obviously, when I started out, I had a little bit more curiosity than some, and went seeking out the original artists, or in some cases searching up country music.","But there are things in Il Sogno that the methods of The Delivery Man could never achieve.","I found with this record I had to really be strong-willed, because in the past I've tended to tinker and add a thing or take a thing away, and nearly always been wrong.","I know that when I make a record like The Delivery Man as a contrast to even Il Sogno, this is going to reach a wider audience, because it communicates in that very direct way.","I'd been to Memphis before, but we stayed out of Memphis early on in the late 70s for obvious reasons. People were very sensitive about Elvis Presley, and my stage name obviously would be provocative to some people in that area at that time.","I've been lucky to listen to lots of different types of music.","Maybe I just never learned my harmony part, because what everybody says sounds odd to them sounds perfectly natural to me.","Mention Hubert Sumlin, as well, because Hubert's a great man, and again, you know, I don't play the guitar very good, but when I'm playing this kind of music, I always have him in my mind. I wish I could play like Hubert.","Obviously I got known for some other songs early on, and some of those were rock'n'roll songs. Some of them were melodic pop songs. And I've done lots of different things, as you know, but every so often I get drawn back.","Obviously the people that I admired, like the Beatles, were really into rock'n'roll, but it was already a little past rock'n'roll when I started listening and making my own choices about music.","Really the only thing holding a lot of records together is the personality of the singer, and the will to write all of these different things.","Sometimes I write notes that I have difficulty singing.","There are many critics who have an idealised version of where my strengths lie.","Very similar experience happened last year when we released this album, North. It was on Deutsche Grammophon, it was very, very honest. It was the most honest record I've ever written.","Well, I've had a lot of different experiences in music over the years. And not everything you do can satisfy everybody's idealised version of you.","Well, T Bone's had a remarkable career as a producer since the time that we first worked together. He was dividing his time between recording and producing when we first met, and touring. We toured together and we were great friends.","Women hear rhythm differently than men.","People tend to repeat the same quotes at me that I said when I was 23. And of course, you say things then, and sometimes they're ill-advised.","I don't think I was ever particularly mean. I can certainly think of some idiotic exchanges I've had. I was accused of destroying pop music, like Wagner destroyed opera - a guy in Germany started ranting that at me.","My family calls me Declan. But most people call me E.C. I think it comes from my dad. It's an Irish convention. You usually call the first child by the initials.","I'm a working travelling musician, but just on a bigger scale.","I've always felt writing a song was a bit like going on location. That's true in an almost literal sense. Where you are seeps in somehow.","I've worked hard, every single day since I left school. I think I have a Protestant work ethic.","You do have to be a bit careful with your voice. It is an instrument.","Smokey Robinson writes the heartfelt songs, whereas it was my job to write the songs about weakness and failure in love.","I think when I was younger I was not very good at writing love songs that didn't have a twist.","Songs are more powerful than books.","Living a very long time would be a very scary thing.","There was not a lot of rock n' roll in the house. Our parents didn't think it was very groovy, and I tend to agree with them. If you grew up with Charlie Parker, Bill Haley wasn't very hip.","It's a petty thing, but I wouldn't join the Scouts when I was a kid, 'cause you had to swear allegiance to the queen. I'm just not a royalist. I think it's idiotic, a hereditary principle.","I've never felt British. I'm just not interested in national identity. I don't know why.","It's what I do. I don't deserve any awards for this, it's just music. It's just writing songs. You sit down, you write a song, you record it. You tour and play the songs live, dress them up a bit differently, or dress them down.","I get very frustrated by this term 'genre exercise.' I mean, what exactly is that? Genre is not really relevant when you are writing a song; hopefully you are doing it to explore something, to create something, and I don't agree that any of my albums are genre exercises.","I find it to be the ultimate backhanded compliment when you are compared against yourself.","People become so deeply attached to the sound of one period that they blow a fuse when you move on. I've heard people complain bitterly about recordings they haven't even heard.","I've had an unusual life. A life far removed from most people's experience."],"Elvis Mitchell":["If you start off as a fearsome figure in pop culture, it's almost axiomatic that at some point, years under the lights softens you into a cuddly family figure.","'Black Hawk Down' has such distinctive visual aplomb that its jingoism starts to feel like part of its atmosphere.","The action comedy 'Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl' raises one of the most overlooked and important cinematic questions of our time: Can a movie maintain the dramatic integrity of a theme park ride?","Inarritu's films focus on the repercussions of a single act that draws people together and simultaneously throws their lives into chaos.","The story of a proud Roman soldier who is sold into slavery and must fight his way back to freedom, 'Gladiator' suggests what would happen if someone made a movie of the imminent extreme-football league and shot it as if it were a Chanel commercial.","'Boat Trip' is more tiresome and dumb than actually bad.","The stoic drama 'A Somewhat Gentle Man' is photographed in a palate of steel gray tones that match Stellan Skarsgard's complexion. It's a low-blood-pressure version of the kind of thing James M. Cain used to do in his sleep, and its filmmaking accomplishment is as minimalist as its narrative ambition is minimal.","The road back from degradation begins with self-awareness - and sometimes, as in 'Phone Booth,' change can begin with a single phone call.","Ice Cube went straight outta Compton to hearing, 'Are we there yet?' Eddie Murphy blew up striding across the stage in a red leather ensemble that would have made Elvis Presley chuckle, yet is probably best known to anyone born in the 21st century as the overly chatty donkey from 'Shrek.'","The title 'Spirited Away' could refer to what Disney has done on a corporate level to the revered Japanese animation director Hayao Miyazaki's epic and marvelous new anime fantasy.","Spending time with Mexican-born writer and director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, you'd never guess that he's the filmmaker behind a series of movies known as the 'Death Trilogy.' The way he dotes on his children and talks about his wife makes it clear that he has a crackling passion for life.","'Man is an endangered species,' announces one of the titles at the beginning of the sci-fi lump 'Battlefield Earth.' And after about 20 minutes of this amateurish picture, extinction doesn't seem like such a bad idea.","Performance art is really more of a command than an invitation.","'Plan Nine From Outer Space' for a new generation, 'Battlefield Earth' is set in the year 3000, after the beings from the planet Psychlo have conquered our planet in only nine minutes.","Each country has its own way of communicating a narrative and, through that, expressing family experiences in emotional stories.","People can be incredibly proprietary about Superman. They think that the character belongs to them.","One thing that I've noticed about big families is that they usually break down into two camps: the talkers and the watchers.","It's more dangerous to be a friend or relative of Jackie Chan in the star's movies than it is to play the third yeoman on a 'Star Trek' episode.","It's true that as Mr. Chan makes more American movies - and gets older - we will never again see the kind of fistfight choreography that the star would devote four months to shoot.","If Mr. Chan ever makes another movie like 'The Tuxedo,' it's American audiences that will see him in court. With 'Shanghai Knights,' he has come through with one of his best. This time, it's personable.","A little of the sketch character Pootie Tang went a long way on HBO's now late, probably soon to be lamented 'Chris Rock Show.' So it's surprising how much fun the character's film debut, 'Pootie Tang,' is.","One of the best things Gwyneth Paltrow has done in years was her mesmerized, good-sport cameo in a 'Pootie' sketch, when she was melted over him like butter on an English muffin.","What makes 'Pootie Tang' the motion picture enjoyable is its no-brow ambitions; it's a joke action film. It slides through enough African-American pop culture signifiers to raise laughs out of those who will appreciate the references; it revels in more cheese per square inch than a soul food diner.","'Pootie Tang' may be raw and slovenly - hey, it often is raw and slovenly - but it succeeds as a laugh getter because of the spot-on satirical notes. You might say that the movie walks it like it talks it; I'm not sure what Pootie would say.","'The Third Man,' directed by Carol Reed and written by Graham Greene, is, quite simply, one of the finest movies ever made.","Often, when Jim Carrey plays it straight, all of the vitality is drained from his face; he looks like a root-canal patient trying out a pleasant expression for his oral surgeon.","One of the funniest things about Mr. Kaufman is that all of his filmed scripts - 'Being John Malkovich,' 'Human Nature,' 'Adaptation' and now 'Sunshine' - sound like titles from REM's 'Reckoning.'","'Va Savoir' is a lovable comedy about love that looks upon life as drama and uses the world of the theater as a staging device.","The director Sofia Coppola's new comic melodrama, 'Lost in Translation,' thoroughly and touchingly connects the dots between three standards of yearning in movies: David Lean's 'Brief Encounter,' Richard Linklater's 'Before Sunrise' and Wong Kar-wai's 'In the Mood for Love.'","Music is a big part of the director's life; Ms. Coppola's previous feature, a screen adaptation of 'The Virgin Suicides,' was informed more substantially by the score by the group Air than by the narrative.","The influence of John Hughes is fully felt in the melodrama 'Donnie Darko.' This first film written and directed by Richard Kelly is a wobbly cannonball of a movie that tries to go Mr. Hughes one better; it's like a Hughes version of a novel by Gabriel Garcia Marquez.","It may be a bit early to make such judgments, but 'Battlefield Earth' may well turn out to be the worst movie of this century.","Adapted from the novel by L. Ron Hubbard, who cranked out sci-fi pulp by the cubic ton, 'Battlefield Earth' has the musty feel of the days when the genre's highlight was Flash Gordon.","What we're most aware of in 'Eight-Legged Freaks' is how similar it is to other movies, a recombinant mutated species itself, the product of the crossbreeding of the suffering-from-gigantism movies of the 1950s and the 1990 B-picture classic 'Tremors.'","'Eight-Legged Freaks' runs out of gas scarily fast - its one-joke premise lends itself more to a short than a feature.","Whom do you feel sorrier for: the cast of 'Boat Trip' or their children? Remember, kids can be very cruel - and this latest 'get Cuba Gooding Jr. career counseling fast' project is a misfire from beginning to end.","Establishing mood through pictorial means is the director Ridley Scott's most notable talent. There may be no working director more accomplished at wringing texture out of the color blue than the prodigious and now prolific Mr. Scott; you'd swear that with his dazzling washes of blues and sand tones, he was inventing additional hues on the spot.","'Black Hawk Down' wants to be about something, and in the midst of the meticulously staged gunfire, the picture seems to choose futility arbitrarily.","Justin Lin, the writer and director of the teenage-wasteland drama 'Better Luck Tomorrow,' a shrewdly tense piece of storytelling, recognizes that sometimes it's good for a filmmaker to stir up trouble.","Can you sue yourself for plagiarism? If so, then 'Old School' has presented Ivan Reitman with a case.","There's a great deal of echoing going on in 'Old School.' Mr. Piven, who played the upstart outsider in the 1994 campus comedy 'PCU,' has crossed over into playing the stiff martinet.","'Old School' is so breezy it could be a late-night talk show, especially when Craig Kilborn, of 'The Late Late Show,' sidles into camera range as a particularly loathsome competitor to Mitch.","In 'Windtalkers,' the director John Woo is meticulous in melding his own intimate style into the cliches of a large-scale war movie, paying homage to all the tired conventions of the genre. But it's an honor that these cliches don't deserve.","Given the knee-jerk patriotism of recent war movies, it's discouraging to see 'Windtalkers' evade pertinent facts that could have recast the doubled-edged issues of racism and loyalty and made them relevant to contemporary times.","In 'Requiem for a Dream,' the director Darren Aronofsky's adaptation of Hubert Selby Jr.'s lower-depths novel, Jared Leto has lost so much weight, he looks like another person altogether.","When an actor commits himself to a role as fully as Russell Crowe does in the grandiose and silly 'Gladiator,' you may ask yourself why and at the same time thank him for his absorption in the part.","His work isn't all glower. Even though he hasn't smiled in a movie since the underrated 'Proof' in the early 1990s, Mr. Crowe is given to a hurt swallow when he's uncomfortable and to a look of suffering in his eyes.","The battle scenes in 'Gladiator' don't have the exultant lift of Hong Kong period-action pictures like the 'Once Upon a Time in China' series, where the fights have the eye-popping panache of dance sequences from a musical.","Though finally overwhelmed by a preening lassitude, 'Hotel' is never less than fascinating, breaking into multiscreen scenarios like Mr. Figgis's 2000 experiment, 'Timecode.'","Political perspective and the Cannes festival are linked almost as inextricably as fast-food consumption and detrimental effects on health.","'Ali' is a breakthrough for its director, Michael Mann. The film, based on the life of Muhammad Ali, is Mr. Mann's first movie with feeling; his overwhelming love of its subject will turn audiences into exuberant, thrilled fight crowds.","Muhammad Ali inside the ring and Muhammad Ali outside the ring were totally different men; his abrasive, magnetic daring and infectious self-love outside the ring galvanized the world and distracted many from his sniper's precision. He was a heavyweight with the fluttering gracefulness of a middleweight.","Ali was the African-American who exulted in saying exactly what he was capable of, and the bouncing-boy braggadocio of hip-hop is impossible to imagine without him. So it makes sense that one of his spiritual children, the sunny-dispositioned rapper turned actor Will Smith, would play him.","'Ali' offers stunning re-creations of bouts Ali fought. In the second Liston fight, the auditorium is underlighted and clouded with fetid cigar smoke, which was why the famous picture of a snarling Ali standing over Liston was so dramatic; indoor arenas are now bright enough to be spotted from Alpha Centauri.","'Infernal Affairs' uses a vibrating terseness usually found in the writer and director Michael Mann's work. Thematically, this film deploys the techniques Mr. Mann brought to bear on 'Heat,' right down to using a similar cold-blooded electronic score.","The world may not be ready yet for the film equivalent of books on tape, but this peculiar phenomenon has arrived in the form of the film adaptation of J. K. Rowling's 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.'","Watching daring, high-tech criminals in action, I have the same thought that probably occurs to other moviegoers: if these guys just held on to some of the money they spend on equipment, they wouldn't have to turn to a life of crime.","It would be hard to make a movie worse than the first 'Ocean's Eleven,' the 1960 Lewis Milestone film.","For those not so taken by the star power, this new 'Ocean's Eleven' is the equivalent of a domineering team you can't stand that enters the Super Bowl. Even if you don't like the players, the odds are so good that it's tough to bet against them.","The Wachowskis' use of space rivals that of musical directors like Gene Kelly and Mark Sandrich.","Tina Fey, a performer and head writer for 'Saturday Night Live,' has deftly adapted Rosalind Wiseman's nonfiction dissection of teenage girl societal interaction, 'Queen Bees and Wannabes: Helping Your Daughter Survive Cliques, Gossip, Boyfriends and Other Realities of Adolescence.'","Since most of 'Mean Girls' consists of the outsider Cady observing the tribal rites of her new setting and laying it all out in narration, this movie is just like home for the meticulous and ruthless deadpan that Ms. Fey has perfected for the satirical 'S.N.L.' newscast in which she and Jimmy Fallon are the anchors.","Though narrative cohesion isn't the strength of 'Mean Girls,' which works better from scene to scene than as a whole, the intelligence shines in its understanding of contradictions, keeping a comic distance from the emotional investment of teenagers that defined 'Ridgemont High' and later the adolescent angst movies of John Hughes.","Scene by scene, you can't help being impressed by 'Mean Girls;' it's like a group of sketches linked by a theme, with some playing much better than others.","With his compulsively slamming lyrics and king-of-the-world delivery, DMX intuitively echoes the existentialism of the projects of the novelist Donald Goines.","'Never Die Alone' is primarily a riveting genre film that neatly exhibits the director's growing assurance - Donald Goines would be proud.","You can't ignore the Asian and Hispanic populations in L.A. We can let audiences know independent film is not just about white men.","I thought that, as a black audience member, I would like to see something that reflected an experience that's not normally exhibited in documentaries, or is so much about black people as victims in this country, and black people not taking control of their own lives and their own destinies.","We want to see ourselves - but differently. We want to see these dream versions of ourselves. We want to be surprised; we want to be entertained. I think primarily, especially in this country, we ask that movies entertain us, which seems to be something they're less and less likely to do on a continual basis.","It's so funny: whenever there's a new technology introduced, there's always this fear it's going to end entertainment as we know it. When records came around, they were going to be the end of live music. Nobody would ever want to go see live music again.","We do want to be diverted and be interested and be provoked by popular culture - by art, if we're lucky. And it's amazing how often people have lost sight of this.","Probably the worst thing that ever happened to the movies was the megahit.","There are storytelling traditions that come from Africa that are unique from anywhere else.","Just the idea of seeing a type of narrative we've not seen before is a chance to be surprised.","The picture is being promoted as Disney's 'Spirited Away,' although seeing just 10 minutes of this English version of a hugely popular Japanese film will quickly disabuse any discerning viewer of the notion that it is a Disney creation.","Mr. Miyazaki's specialty is taking a primal wish of kids, transporting them to a fantasyland, and then marooning them there. No one else conjures the phantasmagoric and shifting morality of dreams - that fascinating and frightening aspect of having something that seems to represent good become evil - in the way this master Japanese animator does.","Miramax seems to be showing the same faith in Roberto Benigni's 'Pinocchio' that the Republican Party showed in Trent Lott; the live-action version of Carlo Collodi's fairy tale about the wooden puppet whose only ambition was to be a real live boy was sneaked into theaters Christmas Day.","It's an oddity that will be avoided by millions of people, this new 'Pinocchio.' Osama bin Laden could attend a showing in Times Square and be confident of remaining hidden."],"Elvis Presley":["I'm not trying to be sexy. It's just my way of expressing myself when I move around.","Truth is like the sun. You can shut it out for a time, but it ain't goin' away.","Rock and roll music, if you like it, if you feel it, you can't help but move to it. That's what happens to me. I can't help it.'","Until we meet again, may God bless you as he has blessed me.","Ambition is a dream with a V8 engine.","Whatever I will become will be what God has chosen for me.","People ask me where I got my singing style. I didn't copy my style from anybody.","A live concert to me is exciting because of all the electricity that is generated in the crowd and on stage. It's my favorite part of the business, live concerts.","Rhythm is something you either have or don't have, but when you have it, you have it all over.","Adversity is sometimes hard upon a man; but for one man who can stand prosperity, there are a hundred that will stand adversity.","The colored folks been singing it and playing it just like I'm doin' now, man, for more years than I know. I got it from them.","Man, that record came out and was real big in Memphis. They started playing it, and it got real big. Don't know why-the lyrics had no meaning.","I'm trying to keep a level head. You have to be careful out in the world. It's so easy to get turned.","Every time I think that I'm getting old, and gradually going to the grave, something else happens.","When I was a boy, I always saw myself as a hero in comic books and in movies. I grew up believing this dream.","The army teaches boys to think like men.","I hope I didn't bore you too much with my life story.","The Lord can give, and the Lord can take away. I might be herding sheep next year.","I never expected to be anybody important.","I think I have something tonight that's not quite correct for evening wear. Blue suede shoes.","I have no use for bodyguards, but I have very specific use for two highly trained certified public accountants.","Just because I managed to do a little something, I don't want anyone back home to think I got the big head.","When I get married, it'll be no secret.","I'll stay in Memphis.","I'll never make it, it will never happen, because they're never going to hear me 'cause they're screaming all the time.","I'll never feel comfortable taking a strong drink, and I'll never feel easy smoking a cigarette. I just don't think those things are right for me.","The image is one thing and the human being is another. It's very hard to live up to an image, put it that way.","I was training to be an electrician. I suppose I got wired the wrong way round somewhere along the line.","Man, I really like Vegas.","There are too many people that depend on me. I'm too obligated. I'm in too far to get out.","The closest I ever came to getting married was just before I started singing. In fact, my first record saved my neck.","From the time I was a kid, I always knew something was going to happen to me. Didn't know exactly what.","I've never written a song in my life. It's all a big hoax.","After a hard day of basic training, you could eat a rattlesnake.","I don't think I'm bad for people. If I did think I was bad for people, I would go back to driving a truck, and I really mean this.","I've tried to lead a straight, clean life, not set any kind of a bad example.","Since the beginning, it was just the same. The only difference, the crowds are bigger now.","I'd just like to be treated like a regular customer.","It's human nature to gripe, but I'm going ahead and doing the best I can.","The next thing I knew, I was out of the service and making movies again. My first picture was called, GI Blues. I thought I was still in the army.","I sure lost my musical direction in Hollywood. My songs were the same conveyer belt mass production, just like most of my movies were.","I don't know anything about music. In my line you don't have to.","I like entertaining people. I really miss it.","I was an only child, and Mother was always right with me all my life. I used to get very angry at her when I was growing up-it's a natural thing.","More than anything else, I want the folks back at home to think right of me.","I don't do any vulgar movements.","My movements, ma'am, are all leg movements. I don't do nothing with my body.","I happened to come along in the music business when there was no trend.","I did the Ed Sullivan show four times. I did the Steve Allen show. I did the Jackie Gleason show.","Those movies sure got me into a rut.","I learned how important it is to entertain people and give them a reason to come and watch you play.","I've been getting some bad publicity - but you got to expect that.","When I got outta High School I was driving a truck. I was just a poor boy from Memphis, Memphis.","They put me on television. And the whole thing broke loose. It was wild, I tell ya for sure.","Later on they send me to Hollywood. To make movies. It was all new to me. I was only 21 years old.","Too much TV hurts movies.","I miss my singing career very much.","That's why I hate to get started in these jam sessions. I'm always the last one to leave.","I'm no hillbilly singer.","I was an overnight sensation.","Those people in New York are not gonna change me none.","I like to sing ballads the way Eddie Fisher does and the way Perry Como does. But the way I'm singing now is what makes the money.","I'm strictly for Stevenson. I don't dig the intellectual bit, but I'm telling you, man, he knows the most.","I'm so nervous. I've always been nervous, ever since I was a kid.","I knew by heart all the dialogue of James Dean's films; I could watch Rebel Without a Cause a hundred times over."],"Elvis Stojko":["I had the strength and the finesse there and put it all together.","After you've done it for so many years, you have to find a new direction. You have to find something in your soul that's going to push you towards - to find your inspiration.","A lot of times when you go through a very traumatic situation and it's emotionally difficult to deal with you come back spiritually stronger. It changes you in a way.","All I know is that skating is getting better, the guys are getting better throughout the whole age range.","Always looked up to Brian and his skating, I loved his skating and what he had done for the sport. And the triple axel, that was the thing, and I wanted a triple axel.","And then, looking back at my first Olympics, and when the pressure was on, in '94 and '98, and looking back and going, wow. I sensed and felt what Brian had gone through.","But a lot of my training can be done in Aston - a lot of the hard work, so to speak. But a new atmosphere, a new place, and it's good for me because I didn't want to get stuck in one spot, so coming home is good, back and forth, you know, where my roots are.","I could not have done anymore, I had pushed myself to a limit that I had never touched before and that's definitely going to change you - than going out and doing what you do in practice every day.","I don't want to prove to anyone or prove to myself. I'd rather just enjoy and show myself that I am capable of doing it and actually going through the process.","I trained and trained and went up against Kurt, then being a world champion in '94, and after that I did Tommy's tour and then my tour and all this stuff and just trying to deal with it all. And now, I've just kind of backed off a little.","I won't be skating for the rest of my life, that's for sure.","I would have to agree, that I'm probably more intense than Brian or Kurt, competitive because, I was always like this, always being that way, always real competitive.","Just a whole different style, just a whole different way of going about an audience and a way about skating. And they are so brilliant in their own way, which is great, and that's what Brian was saying; is the styles are different, and it's the whole mentality.","Just before I got down here I had a chance to see Agassi play another game and he smoked another player, which was nice to see. Someone who a lot of people thought couldn't come back and now he's winning.","My mom was a dancer, my dad's a singer and I've always had that kind of music in my life.","Technically, the last number of years, partially from the injury, it's been difficult to push forward but I felt even before the injury that I still could do more and was sort of at a stalemate.","When you're younger, your inspiration is there. As you get older, it tends to waver. Once you find it - I found it again - that's where you can draw from. That's where you draw your strength from.","You're always learning on different avenues and this is an opportunity for me to start on a fresh plate and start learning some other things that can really help me, that I need, and I want, to progress forward."],"Ely Culbertson":["A deck of cards is built like the purest of hierarchies, with every card a master to those below it, a lackey to those above it.","The bizarre world of cards is a world of pure power politics where rewards and punishments are meted out immediately.","God and the politicians willing, the United States can declare peace upon the world, and win it."],"Elyn Saks":["The schizophrenic mind is not so much split as shattered. I like to say schizophrenia is like a waking nightmare.","Please hear this: There are not 'schizophrenics.' There are people with schizophrenia.","We must stop criminalizing mental illness. It's a national tragedy and scandal that the L.A. County Jail is the biggest psychiatric facility in the United States.","My mind has been both my best friend and my worst enemy.","Choose your friends wisely, and also choose friends that you can trust.","Some people say I'm unique, that there aren't other people with schizophrenia like me. Well, there are people like me out there, but the stigma is so great that they don't come forward.","I am a woman with chronic schizophrenia. I have spent hundreds of days in psychiatric hospitals. I could have ended up living most of my life on a back ward, but things turned out quite differently.","One of the reasons the doctors gave for hospitalizing me against my will was that I was 'gravely disabled.' To support this view, they wrote in my chart that I was unable to do my Yale Law School homework. I wondered what that meant about much of the rest of New Haven.","Occupying my mind with complex problems has been my best and most powerful and most reliable defense against my mental illness.","In a way, I had a very good and normal childhood. I had loving and caring parents. But I had a lot of quirks or problems when I was growing up. I had phobias and obsessions.","My experience is that when one is in psychosis, you're on a mission and nothing is going to stop you. At some level your brain is telling you you probably shouldn't be doing this, but you're on a mission."],"Emanuel Ax":["I usually only play with very close friends.","We should welcome applause whenever it comes.","Mozart often wrote to his family that certain variations or sections of pieces were so successful that they had to be encored immediately, even without waiting for the entire piece to end.","Everyone is different. Sometimes it's very exciting; sometimes very scary.","We seem to have set up some very arcane rules as to when it is actually OK to applaud.","The stage is close to being in the middle of the hall, so that the performers are surrounded by the listeners. I feel that we are all experiencing the music together.","The sheer force of the music calls for a wild audience reaction.","Sometimes I wish that applause would come just a bit later, when it is so beautifully hushed that I feel like holding my breath in the silence of the end.","Pianists don't argue too much generally because we have such a hard time just getting things right; arguing is for string players.","It is wonderful to see how happy all my friends in the LA Philharmonic are in their new home.","If there were no rules about when to applaud, we in the audience would have the right response almost always.","If the audience walks out of a concert thinking, What a wonderful experience, then we have done our job.","I have been trying to find out exactly when listeners and performers decided that applause between movements would not be allowed, but nobody seems to have been willing to admit that they were the culprit.","I have been coming to Los Angeles since 1975 to perform.","I have always thought that my ear is also very influenced by my eyes.","How wonderful it is to play with someone you feel very close to.","Everybody makes his path differently.","Even if you don't like a concert of mine, please, please applaud at the end anyway.","Applause should be an emotional response to the music, rather than a regulated social duty.","All of us love applause, and so we should - it means that the listener likes us!","A lot of it just has to do with luck, serendipity."],"Emanuel Azenberg":["Will the theater disappear? No. Is it healthy? Also no.","This is an industry that doesn't have the common cold... It has cholera."],"Emanuel Celler":["The power to investigate is a great public trust.","Illegality will never solve the problem of political lawlessness.","On the one hand we publicly pronounce the equality of all peoples; on the other hand, in our immigration laws, we embrace in practice these very theories we abhor and verbally condemn.","People were hurt, and because they were hurt, they were angry and quarreled and were jealous of one another.","Communism feeds on aggression, hatred, and the imprisonment of men's minds and souls. This shall not take root in the United States.","I didn't know then that I would never be able to leave the sounds and smells of these sights behind me, but I was fiercely conscious of one thing-my ambition.","I had fought against the unjust restriction of immigration.","I had taken on the color of the climate around me and had driven back all the emotion that rose from the Brooklyn streets so that I could belong to the exclusive club of Congress.","In March of 1933 we witnessed a revolution in manner, in mores, in the definition of government. What before had been black or white sprang alive with color.","In our house we repeated the pattern of thousands of other homes. There were a few books and a lot of music. Our food and our furniture were no different from our neighbors'.","It is the purpose of the majority of the Immigration Committee to encourage assimilation, yet this bill has already done more than anything I know of to bring about discord among our resident aliens.","My grandfather, in 1848, had fled from Germany to find political freedom in the United States.","My wife - to-be and I went to see my father. Only he could answer the two questions before us: Shall we get married now? Shall I begin the practice of law, or continue being the successful wine salesman I had become, working my way through law school?","Our population is headed for a stable plateau, which means an aging population.","Roosevelt's humor was broad, his manner friendly. Of wit there was little; of philosophy, none. What did he possess? Intuition, inspiration, love of adventure.","Roosevelt's magic lay in one facet of his personality: He knew how to take the risk. No other man in public life I knew could so readily take the challenge of the new.","The author of McCarthyism was given the distinction of addressing the Republican National Convention. This strikes terror in the hearts of honest men.","The Democratic Party will never desert the freedoms of our people under the guise of pretending to protect them.","The inferior complex is now extended to all Europe, save Nordics.","The panic of the Depression loosened my inhibitions against being different. I could be myself.","The population forecast for the United States in 1970 is 170 million. The population forecast for Russia alone in 1970 is 251 million. The implications are clear.","The rate of population growth in the United States is slightly below that required to reproduce itself.","The studied, unquestioning pace of my family irritated me.","The study of music was a family interest.","We believe firmly that Communism internally and externally can and must be fought without resort to the Communist tactics of the suppression of all individual freedom.","We pledge to fight the dark forces high in the counsels of the Republican Party which have made political capital out of the techniques of character assassination by innuendo.","I had advocated the establishment of a Negro industrial commission. I had gestured against the growth of monopoly power. I had introduced a few civil rights bills.","My grandfather was Catholic; my grandmother, Jewish. Crossing over from Bavaria, as immigrants to the United States, the ship started to sink. My grandmother jumped overboard. My grandfather followed, to save this girl he had never met."],"Emanuel Cleaver":["There is more power in unity than division.","Hope fills the holes of my frustration in my heart.","God did not burden the United States with a diversity of backgrounds, ideas and religions, He blessed America with them.","Community colleges need to be upgraded. We got to have training for real jobs. We've got a lot of jobs that are going unfilled because we don't have the technology in the heads of graduating college students to deal with them.","Social Security is a covenant that should not be broken.","There are people walking around the streets of Kansas City who are unemployed, while one of our largest employers is not only sending jobs aboard, but then turning around and making a statement about preserving jobs.","We've gotten to the point now where Republicans and Democrats have nothing in common besides being members of the 'caustic caucus,' and we can't get anything done.","I have family in Tanzania. I can't even explain the joy of riding through the Tanzania national park and seeing giraffes run across the road and elephants over in a pond and baboons running.","One thing I've learned - and I've said this to Republicans and Democrats - is, bees cannot sting and make honey at the same time. They have to make a choice. Either they are going to be a stinger or a honey-maker, and I contend that honey is a symbol of legislation and, the nuclear language used by members is the stinger, and you can't do both.","First of all, do I think there's some racists in the Tea Party? Yeah. I'm an ordained United Methodist pastor; there's some racists in the Methodist church. I don't know if there's a body that does not have some racists in it.","America, I am a strong believer that how we treat each other matters.","We can be fervent in our disagreements without being factitious with our beliefs.","Congress is unable to do the work of the American people because too many politicians believe that compromise means capitulation.","We may be a nation of Democrats, Independents, and Republicans, but first and foremost we are all human beings and Americans.","Let's do more than say the 'Pledge of Allegiance.' Let us live it!","Hope is the motivation that empowers the unemployed, enabling them to get out of bed every single morning with unbounded enthusiasm as they look for work.","We have Democrats saying dumb things every single day, and Republicans as well.","The truth of the matter is the tone is toxic here in Washington, and we have been exporting it around the country.","You would think that if any group in America had 20% to 25% unemployment, it would generate all kinds of attention. The Labor Department would understandably and necessarily begin to concentrate on what can we do to reduce this level of unemployment. Congress would give great time on the floor for debate on what can be done."],"Emanuel Steward":["My favorite hobby is being alone. I like to be alone. I also like dancing, fishing, playing poker sometimes and vegetable gardening - corn, tomatoes, cucumbers, I have a big garden every year.","If there is one abiding theme in the gym, it's the withering work in the ring. Those not fit do not survive.","You look at boxing being an international, world-famous sport, right up there next with soccer, and there's only two fighters the people want to see fight. Two little fellows, Manny Pacquiao and Floyd Mayweather.","I went to a motivational training course once, a course of self-discovery, and I found out after a week that my fear - it was not a fear of not being accepted - was a very violent fear of failure.","There's not as much oxygen in that hot gym and I think it's great for conditioning. I believe in a lot of boxing. You can train and work on the speed bag and heavy bag, but when you get in the ring with another fighter, it's a different story. Punches are coming at you, there's physical contact, muscle against muscle.","When I was a little kid I wanted to be an artist or a painter. But once I got into boxing, all I wanted was to box.","I started boxing when I was eight. I enjoyed when I could hit someone and they couldn't hit me back. It was like a game for me. The feeling of knocking someone out. My first knockout victory was when I was ten. He went down and his nose started to bleed, so they stopped it.","I would love to see Wladimir Klitschko fight Antonio Tarver for many reasons. One is Tarver talks a lot; he would build up a big fight. And Tarver is coming off of a great victory. So I think he would be a good opponent.","I began these clinics because I want to share my years of experience in around the ring, in addition to my proven winning methods. I have seen the good and the bad. I have learned valuable lessons, which I want to pass along to those truly interested in the sport.","Hopefully in 2011 the fans will get to see some fights that they want to see. Manny Pacquiao Vs. Floyd Mayweather needs to happen, and so does David Haye Vs. Wladimir Klitschko. The fans deserve to see fights that they want to see and not just the fights that the promoters want to see.","I used to love to see Willie Pep and Ray Robinson. To me, the epitome of a great athlete is a great boxer. I just love the rhythm of seeing a man dance, slip punches. I loved the dancers and boxers. I would see them and be mesmerized."],"Emanuel Swedenborg":["True charity is the desire to be useful to others with no thought of recompense.","That every man after the life in the world lives to eternity, is evident from this, that man is then spiritual, and no longer natural, and that the spiritual man, separated from the natural, remains such as he is to eternity, for man's state cannot be changed after death.","But by all this I am not deterred, for I have seen, I have heard, I have felt.","The Divine of the Lord in heaven is love, for the reason that love is receptive of all things of heaven, such as peace, intelligence, wisdom and happiness.","The angels taken collectively are called heaven, for they constitute heaven; and yet that which makes heaven in general and in particular is the Divine that goes forth from the Lord and flows into the angels and is received by them.","Love consists in desiring to give what is our own to another and feeling his delight as our own.","I am well aware that many will say that no one can possibly speak with spirits and angels so long as he lives in the body; and many will say that it is all fancy, others that I relate such things in order to gain credence, and others will make other objections.","In the Christian world... it is believed that angels were created at the beginning, and that heaven was formed of them; and that the Devil or Satan was an angel of light, who, becoming rebellions, was cast down with his crew, and that this was the origin of hell.","Man was so created by the Lord as to be able while living in the body to speak with spirits and angels, as in fact was done in the most ancient times; for, being a spirit clothed with a body, he is one with them.","Moreover, no one is judged from the natural man, thus not so long as he lives in the natural world, for man is then in a natural body; but everyone is judged in the spiritual man, and therefore when he comes into the spiritual world, for man is then in a spiritual body.","That all who have ever been born men from the beginning of creation, and are deceased, are either in heaven or in hell, follows from those things which have been said and shown in the preceding article, namely, that Heaven and Hell are from the human race.","For the judgment was accomplished not only upon all the men of the Christian church, but also upon all who are called Mohammedans, and, moreover, upon all the Gentiles in the whole world.","I have often talked with angels on this subject, and they have invariably declared that in heaven they are unable to divide the Divine into three, because they know and perceive that the Divine is One and this One is in the Lord.","The human race is the basis on which heaven is founded, is because man was last created, and that which is last created is the basis of all that precedes.","In the spiritual body moreover, man appears such as he is with respect to love and faith, for everyone in the spiritual world is the effigy of his own love, not only as to the face and the body, but also as to the speech and the actions.","And as the Divine that goes forth from the Lord is the good of love and the truth of faith, the angels are angels and are heaven in the measure in which they receive good and truth from the Lord.","First of all it must be known who the God of heaven is, since upon that all the other things depend.","For in every particular of the Word there is an internal sense which treats of things spiritual and heavenly, not of things natural and worldly, such as are treated of in the sense of the letter.","For the spiritual sense of the Word treats everywhere of the spiritual world, that is, of the state of the church in the heavens, as well as in the earth; hence the Word is spiritual and Divine.","In heaven there are two distinct loves, love to the Lord and love towards the neighbor, in the inmost or third heaven love to the Lord, in the second or middle heaven love towards the neighbor.","The act of exploring what the men are, and moreover the separation of the good from the evil, is visitation; and the good are then removed, and the evil are left behind.","The quality of the Lord's church on earth, cannot be seen by any man, so long as he lives in the world, still less how the church in process of time has turned aside from good to evil.","There are angels that receive more interiorly the Divine that goes forth from the Lord, and others that receive it less interiorly; the former are called celestial angels, and the latter spiritual angels.","This Divine truth flows into heaven from the Lord from His Divine love.","To have dominion by religion, is to have dominion over men's souls, thus over their very spiritual life, and to use the Divine things, which are in their religion, as the means.","Without such a Life, the Word as to the letter is dead.","He who is in evil, is also in the punishment of evil."],"Emayatzy Corinealdi":["Give up as much as you're willing to receive back and give yourself, if that makes any sense. Whatever that is, don't expect more from a person than what you're willing to give, but give it knowing that you're giving it - it's been given, so don't expect anything else.","One of the roles I hold really close to my heart is a small 'under-five' role I did on 'The Young and the Restless.' I think I did about four episodes and it meant so much to me, simply because it was my mom's all-time favorite soap.","I'm a tomboy at the end of the day, so anything that causes me to have to run around, fight people, roll in the dirt, hop a fence - I'm all for it. So I really would love to do an action film.","I just love drama. I love the idea of exploring relationships, whatever they may be. That's fun for me.","Not long ago someone said I should shorten it to just Emma. But I really, really love my name. From as far as I can remember, my parents have taught me to be really proud of my name.","I'm pretty much going to say what I feel.","I remember thinking, in Kansas my name will be Evett - which is my middle name. I didn't want to explain to anyone how to say Em-a-yat-zee.","We left Germany when I was 11.","After high school, I had $2,000 saved, and I packed everything I could into my '95 Nissan Sentra with no air-conditioning, and I drove out to L.A."],"Embeth Davidtz":["I've accepted I can't rely on my work alone; I must market myself. The truly spectacular roles do go to the girls who actively promote their popularity.","I was amazed at the rosy glow that can be around one when you're in a film that's done well.","The smartest people I know have that extra edge. The risk is always there that you'll look terribly undignified and slobbering, and inside I cringe about that, but I should be more aggressive."],"Emeli Sande":["It would be sad if we lost our instinct and our courage to love and protect.","Just thinking of all the things I'd done getting there and everything I've sacrificed to do so. But what's happening now makes it worth it.","Anytime I write something that's trying to be too smart, it doesn't work.","Because they're my stories, they're my version of events of the past three years. But I really hope people can hear their own stories within the songs and they can become our version of events.","I feel like 'Next To Me' is a great introduction because it's a simple song that has a simple message for me. I wanted to introduce something that lyrically I'm proud of and introduces me both as an artist and as a writer.","I always wanted to be a musician from when I was kid. It was always a massive dream of mine. School was also really really important to me and having an education was top of my priority. So I really wanted to have a degree before I tried anything in the music industry.","Any song I have to work on longer than a day, I just leave it. It's not gonna work. Everything that's good is really instant.","I always knew I wanted to be a musician, and I always knew I wanted to write, 'cause the people I was listening to all wrote. I never thought it was an option to sing anyone else's songs.","I'm not too bothered about what category my music goes in and there's no point in limiting in who you can reach, but I want it to be respected.","I wanted to make an album that melodically people can connect to; something that reflects our times and the kinds of difficulties we face.","I try to speak of a love that not necessarily romantic. I think there is so much love between people and so much love people want to give but it's harder and harder these days to show that, to celebrate that, you know?","We started very slow in America. It was small acoustic shows. We played places like Los Angeles, New York and Chicago and everywhere there has been a great reaction. It has been really lovely. They listen to the lyrics and the melody over there and the reaction has been fantastic.","I built a reputation as a songwriter in the industry before my own hits. People were used to coming to me for songs. There were songs like 'Clown' and 'Mountains' that were my songs that I wanted to keep. But the record labels saw me as a songwriter. It was hard to get people to believe in me as an artist.","I tried to bang down a lot of doors but Virgin were the only label who believed in what I was doing. I ended up with the label that understood what I was trying to do.","'Clown' was written when I couldn't find anyone who believed in me as an artist. Maybe those labels will think twice next time a young songwriter comes along.","I was finding it very difficult to find a label that understood what I wanted to do and really believed that people wanted to hear something honest and a little bit different. So, I did feel a bit like a clown. You're knocking on everyone's door trying to get them to believe what you're doing.","I want to speak for people that may not feel like they're being spoken for at the moment. And I want to make a connection between the world around us and the charts.","The focus is on singer/songwriters now rather than huge shows. I mean, of course there's always a place for that too.","I mean, there'll always be room for big productions and everything but it's good to see the other side."],"Emeraude Toubia":["I try to be the best version of me that I can be, whether it's acting or on a personal level.","I remember in middle school and high school being so concerned with what everybody else thought. I was trying to be someone I wasn't. I wish I could've just let it slide and not cared about it.","Everything that comes your way is to learn - I definitely feel that.","Being Latina, I'm super close with my family. I love them, and I love spending time with them. I love being at my grandma's house and eating her food.","Dominic Sherwood would always tell me a joke right before it was my take or my close up. He'd say a funny joke, and I couldn't stop laughing, even after they said, 'Action.'","I'm very close to my parents and my grandma.","When I was young, I wanted to be the face of a makeup campaign or a hair campaign, so that's something that I've always dreamed of that hopefully comes along. And then obviously starring with Ryan Gosling in a movie wouldn't be so bad, either.","I think everything you do in life is a learning experience.","It's nice to be able to do more and to always challenge myself.","I don't go up to guys. I'm all about a guy sending me flowers, getting me chocolates and surprising me.","Fighting is kind of like choreography. It's not just get in there and punching someone: you have to have choreography. Someone is going to hit high; someone is going to hit at the bottom.","I did a lot of dancing when I was young.","I was doing telenovelas in Miami and Mexico, and everyone's dream when you're an actor is to be in Hollywood.","I love doing fight scenes. I've been a dancer since I was 3 years old, so I think that helped me with the movements.","I love to shop at BCBG, because it's classy and elegant but a little bit sexy. It fits who I am in one store.","In my closet, you'd find five black shirts that look the same, 10 pairs of the same white pants, and five pairs of almost the exact same shoe. Every time I go out, I buy shoes that are very similar to my other shoes - it's a problem.","I'm actually not a big coffee fan, so I don't drink it that much. I'd rather have a green tea. But I do love to get a white mocha sometimes - it is just a strong order.","I like to surround myself with people that have dreams and that fight for them every day."],"Emeril Lagasse":["If you think big, then it's going to be big.","You can easily put together your own favorite spice blend, whether that's a salt and pepper mixture or you're adding herbs to it or Creole spice. Just watch out for the sodium content. That why I encourage you to make your own.","I love fresh citrus and always keep lemons, limes, and oranges on hand; they come in handy for spritzing up quickly grilled meats, seafoods, and vegetables, especially when followed up by a quick drizzle of extra virgin olive oil.","I make some of my best recipes with a simple homemade stock. Keep shrimp shells stored in a plastic bag in the freezer. When you have almost a gallon-bag full, you can make a stock in 30 minutes that you can use in soups and sauces. You can then freeze the stock in ice-cube trays.","Cleanliness is very important. If you let kids make a total mess in the kitchen and then leave, you're not really teaching them anything.","I grew up in Fall River, Massachusetts. My background was modest, and I worked at a Portuguese bakery in town.","If you don't follow your dream, who will?","My philosophy from day one is that I can sleep better at night if I can improve an individual's knowledge about food and wine, and do it on a daily basis.","Home base is the support system where we have a culinary team, my own writers because of the shows and the books and stuff, we have a culinary team of about six people. Marketing, public relations, accounting and all that sort of stuff.","If kids can learn how to make a simple Bolognese sauce, they will never go hungry. It's pretty easy to cook pasta, but a good sauce is way more useful.","Life just doesn't hand you things. You have to get out there and make things happen. that's the exciting part.","I don't limit myself.","If somebody has a chance to put my food in their mouth, that tells the story.","The cool thing is that now that people have made this evolution where cooking is cool, people are doing it on weekends, they're doing their own challenges. It's back to cooking. And it's real cooking.","We're setting up an urban farm for kids on more than 20 acres in New Orleans. We want to make this a world-class educational center for the community.","When I cook with my son, I might chop vegetables and have fun with different shapes. Cooking is a way to teach kids about other things, like reading or math with all of the weights and measures. There are so many things that are part of cooking that are also very educational.","I launched The Emeril Lagasse Foundation to provide culinary training, and developmental and educational programs to children in the cities where my restaurants operate. I think everyone has a responsibility to give back to the community if they can, and to help future generations learn new skills.","My favorite Aspen memory is saving an upside-down cake that had exploded from the high altitude.","I think many cooks are afraid of undercooked meats. A good thermometer is a cook's best friend.","I guess I feel that I was following my instincts, and at the same time being guided by the best. I became totally intrigued with Louisiana - the people, the food. It is a part of my life. Everything that has happened for me since moving here has just been icing on the cake.","Music is one of those things that is constantly going in my head all the time. It's sort of like the evolution and creation of doing food, or my philosophy about wine. It's always beating in my head, so it keeps the spirit moving.","I'm working harder than ever now, and I'm putting on my pants the same as I always have. I just get up every day and try to do a little better than the day before, and that is to run a great restaurant with great food, great wine, and great service. That's my philosophy.","I'm not a TV guy. I'm a restaurant chef and a businessman.","When it ceases to be fun, I'll stop and just stay in my restaurants.","I came here because the city has a tradition and is a very respected food city.","Mom ran the house, so we grew up Portuguese.","We're a new show. We can't afford instant replay.","I had these recipes that say do this, do that. Who MAKES these rules?","I've always done food that can work in a set time frame. The message I'm trying to get across is, it doesn't have to take three days to do this. With planning, you can do a lot and really have quality food every day.","Those other 10 o'clock shows that come on, all you get from them is headaches and nightmares when you go to bed! At least we give you food, know what I mean?","My family... always had the value of the family table and these cultural influences of growing up.","I ended up turning down a full scholarship of music at the conservatory to pay to go to cooking school.","I started cooking when I was about 10. I have memories like when I was 6 or 7 with my mom, and when I was 12 I started getting real serious about cooking.","You know, for 300 years it's been kind of the same. There are restaurants in New Orleans that the menu hasn't changed in 125 years, so how is one going to change or evolve the food?","I respected it. I submerged myself into it. So on a lot of days off I would go and fish with the fishermen and the families that ran the boats. I would go work the fields with farmers. I would go and talk with farmers about growing particular products for me.","I spent a lot of time on farms when I was young. My uncle and my dad owned a big farm.","Growing up in New England, being schooled and classically trained, it needed to shake, it needed to evolve.","We began building this incredible new foundation in this restaurant, and that's what began giving me the left-hand side of tradition and the right-hand side, my new palate.","The world has changed, and it's almost been 11 years. I have 975 employees. I have six restaurants. We haven't opened any new ones in almost three years.","In the restaurant it's much more serious.","I'm pretty actively involved with the military because I think they're incredible human beings. If I can give back to them for what they're doing for us, it's a good thing. And I think to have happy soldiers, you need to feed them well.","My Food Network shows, 'Emeril Live' and 'Essence of Emeril,' are not in production right now, but I wouldn't say that I'm necessarily leaving Food Network. I have a lot of television still in me. I enjoy teaching people, so it's just a matter of time before I do something new.","Scatter soaked hardwood chunks over your coals for a quick and easy way to add a smoky nuance to your grilled foods.","Wrap fish fillets, sliced veggies, and other quick-cooking items inside foil packets with bundles of fresh herbs and throw them directly on the grill; the steam will release the herb's perfume and flavor anything contained inside the pouch.","Being a food show and being me, I always kicked it up a notch, which means I would always elevate the spice level or the complexity of a particular dish. So, it was always like we're going to kick this up a little bit.","I have a lot of influences. I'm American-schooled. I'm classically trained. I'm a pretty universal student, if you will. I have a lot of degrees, which really don't pay the rent. I have two doctorate degrees, I have a bachelor's degree, but I'm still a cook.","My food is Louisiana, New Orleans-based, well-seasoned, rustic. I think it's pretty unique because of my background being influenced by my mom, Portuguese and French Canadian. There's a lot going on there.","You know, in 1975 I couldn't get a job in New York City because I was American. The kitchens were predominantly run by French, Swiss, German, and basically I got laughed at. I had education, I had experience, but got laughed at because I was American.","My office in New York is overflowing with all kinds of cookbooks, and in New Orleans we have a huge culinary library. So yeah, I guess I'm a little bit obsessed.","Many of my staff have been with me for over 20 years. I have a great team, and I make sure they feel respected and appreciated.","I wouldn't ask any of my employees to do anything I wouldn't do. And I work as hard, if not harder than the rest of the staff, to set an example. I also believe in giving my employees a lot of room to be creative and to express themselves.","When I first decided to open a restaurant, I was turned down by several banks. It was the late 80's and many restaurants were failing. I refused to give up because I knew I had a good concept.","I was on the board of Andre Agassi's foundation, and seeing the way it operated blew my mind. In 2002, I told my wife, I want to start a foundation to give back, I want it to be for kids in hard circumstances, and I want it to be culinary-driven, because that's who I am.","Radishes grow just about anywhere. People think, 'Oh it's just a radish.' But radishes are delicious, and people don't think of cooking them.","I think all kids need snacks. Mine are fruit machines. I give them things like apple slices, berries and melon. Do I let them eat ice cream? Absolutely. But not every day.","Soups are a great way to introduce a lot of vegetables to kids. Stir-fries, too, because they contain so many different shapes and colors.","A lot of parents ask me how to get kids to eat more vegetables. The first thing I say is that it starts from the top.","Kids are now eating things like edamame and sushi. I didn't know what shiitake mushrooms were when I was 10 - most kids today do.","I've always been known for bold flavors and rustic cooking, but there is another side to me. As you evolve as a cook, you understand life and how serious it is. There comes a point where there's got to be a better balance.","We're probably close to reaching 2,000 shows, which is more than Julia Child and Jacques Pepin together.","My inspiration was my mom. She's a great cook, and she still cooks, and we still banter back and forth about cooking. Growing up in a mostly Portuguese community, food was important and the family table was extremely important. At a very young age I understood that.","You go to a restaurant in the States and kids have these game boards at the table. You don't see that in Italy or Spain. It's not because they can't afford to buy them, it's because that's not what eating together as a family is about.","We'll be going to the fish market and a farmer's market this afternoon to get what we need to make and eat dinner as a family. I'm trying to expose my kids to going to a farmers market or the fish market and learning what that's all about.","Whether it's books or TV, or whatever the case may be, the backbone of what I do is my restaurants.","You are going to be what you put in your body, so I try to teach that to my kids, and the kids around me.","I try to teach my son about sanitation, especially when handling foods like chicken that could be dangerous. I remind him to wash his hands all the time. When my son cooks with me, he stands on a step stool so he can reach the stove. I teach him about safety and fire.","I think you have to be careful with spices. Kids' palates can be very delicate, and they might not like things overspiced. In my cookbooks for kids, I do a milder version of my signature spice blend, Emeril's Essence, called Baby Bam, which has no cayenne pepper.","Start with a clean grill. Keep it clean by brushing with a wire brush after preheating, and again after cooking. Make sure to oil your grates and your food before putting it on the grill to keep it from sticking.","You gotta have good olive oil. You should have a cooking olive oil and you should have a finishing olive oil, like an extra-virgin olive oil.","I think you've got to keep it simple, keep it fresh. Stay away from all that processed stuff, read the labels.","You have to be cautious of eating continuously the same thing. Beef comes to mind right away, and there's nothing wrong with beef, but you've got to do whatever you're doing in moderation. So try to break it up a little bit. Eat some fish or some shellfish at least a couple of times a week.","I can't tell you enough about cinnamon. Cinnamon is an awesome spice to use and it goes great with something like apples in the morning or in a mixture of fruit or in your oatmeal or even in your cereal.","When I want to kick it up, I like to add hardwood chips or chunks to the grill; it adds bold smoky flavors. The most common woods are hickory and mesquite, but you can find alder, apple, cherry and, my personal favorite, pecan.","The premise of 'The Originals' are places that have been open 50, 60, 75, 100 years or longer that are still doing it right that maybe a lot of people, particularly the younger generations, have not even thought about."],"Emerson Fittipaldi":["I was extremely lucky. I had some huge crashes and yet I am still here, thanks to God.","The racing driver's mind has to have the ability to have amazing anticipation, coordination, and reflex. Because of the speed the car goes.","You have to visualize a second or two ahead of your car what line you are taking, what you are going to do, before you get there because it comes too fast.","A racing driver has to be a good driver.","Also, I am very religious. It gave me peace of mind all my career.","Gary Smith, when I came to America, taught me a great deal about racing.","I am very happy because motor racing is very important outside the states, very big all over the world.","I based in Brazil, Sao Paulo, but I come very often to the states, and I travel all over the world.","I go to see grand prix every year, and I watch every race on TV for sure. I probably go to three or four CART races and three or four Formula One races.","I have to accept risk as a racing driver.","I know if someone is coming from my right side. I could feel it.","I think with new president Chris Pook of CART, he is very active and strong.","I wanted to be the best in the world.","I was extremely aggressive from the start.","Indy car racing is much more aggressive.","There are many young talents in Brazil. There is a lot of hope in Felipe Massa. It is very difficult to judge him in his first year, but by the end of the end we are going to have a better position how he does in Formula One.","To race Formula three is very high risk and I am not going to take a chance. Thank god I am not doing it!","When I came to America Al Unser, Jr. was very difficult. And Bobby Unser.","You are going in one second the length of a football field. That means you brain is receiving information from your body what the car is doing physically, bumping, balance, performance.","You had to decompress the pressure before the race. I taught my heart to relax. I lay down before the race. It gave me more energy just before the race."],"Emil Cioran":["However much I have frequented the mystics, deep down I have always sided with the Devil; unable to equal him in power, I have tried to be worthy of him, at least, in insolence, acrimony, arbitrariness and caprice.","Insomnia is a vertiginous lucidity that can convert paradise itself into a place of torture.","One should live and die where one was born... I've been bored everywhere I went. What was the point of leaving Coasta Boacu?","The capital phenomenon, the most catastrophic disaster, is uninterrupted sleeplessness, that nothingness without release.","I lost my sleep, and this is the greatest tragedy that can befall someone. It is much worse than sitting in prison.","I saw that philosophy had no power to make my life more bearable. Thus I lost my belief in philosophy."],"Emil Ferris":["I have a profound interest in embroidery, as I have female ancestors on both sides who embroidered their way through great trials.","There's the way that light shows in darkness, and it is extremely beautiful. And I think it essentializes the experience of being human, to see light in darkness.","Monsters are a departure from 'reality' in a way that allows for a range of fantastic possibilities. I mean this within the world of literature as well as in regards to art. When I sit down to draw, I'm energized by the possibility of creating a monster. That is where I find beauty and pathos.","I learned how not to be alone in the playground.","I was illustrating, and I was cleaning people's houses; I was doing whatever I could to take care of my kid as a single parent.","I still do love monsters. And when I was a kid, they were really important to me. I couldn't wait for Saturday night.","My parents met at the Art Institute of Chicago as students, and somewhere in there, they procreated off to the side and created me.","My mother was very, very beautiful, and I saw that the beautiful women around me were often constrained not only by their beauty but by the way that being an object of male desire frequently caused violence in their lives. And it caused them to be constrained in these terribly sad ways - their brilliance was not valued.","The hardest thing is in terms of the drawing, because, you know, I really have to work to keep my hand fluid, and I've done a lot of recovery, but it's not the same as it once was.","When I read 'Maus,' I realized you could tell a story of tremendous import using the graphic novel.","When I'm too worn out or in pain, I lie in bed and write in my mind.","I never quite became the monster I wanted to be. I feel mostly monstrous as I more become myself. Because the more you become yourself, the more it disturbs other people.","I get afraid of the dark if I'm in a great deal of dark, and I have to move around inside of that fear... But there is a chance that something... will talk to me from the dark, so I have... to be prepared for that communication, which has happened.","I think the Hammer films really made death quite sexy.","Becoming a monster sometimes isn't a choice that you have. We're all that; we're all 'the other' in one way or another.","Being seen is important for people. Doesn't happen enough for anyone. We're not here long in this world.","Silent films weren't so different from my comics - the basic choice both offer an artist is what do you show and what do you tell.","I fell asleep once while washing dishes. I hallucinated prolifically - like, squirrels knitting whole sweaters! It was like my dreams inserted themselves in my waking life.","I kept notebooks as a kid, and they were important to me.","I read a quote to the effect that we are always writing about ourselves no matter what we're doing. That may be so.","Yes, doing a work, telling a story very much represents a way to save my own life, and on so many levels.","I was born with fairly serious scoliosis, and I did not walk at all until I was about two-and-a-half years old.","When I say 'art healed me,' it really healed me!"],"Emil Ludwig":["The decision to kiss for the first time is the most crucial in any love story. It changes the relationship of two people much more strongly than even the final surrender; because this kiss already has within it that surrender.","Many a person has held close, throughout their entire lives, two friends that always remained strange to one another, because one of them attracted by virtue of similarity, the other by difference."],"Emil Nolde":["Clever people master life; the wise illuminate it and create fresh difficulties.","The artist need not know very much; best of all let him work instinctively and paint as naturally as he breathes or walks.","Art is exalted above religion and race. Not a single solitary soul these days believes in the religions of the Assyrians, the Egyptians and the Greeks... Only their art, whenever it was beautiful, stands proud and exalted, rising above all time.","What an artist learns matters little. What he himself discovers has a real worth for him, and gives him the necessary incitement to work.","The art of an artist must be his own art. It is... always a continuous chain of little inventions, little technical discoveries of one's own, in one's relation to the tool, the material and the colors."],"Emil Theodor Kocher":["The thyroid cells take up iodine with particular avidity and are able to store it up in great quantities.","Seldom in the history of medicine has the recognition of the most effective cure followed as swiftly on the heels of the discovery of a disease as the establishment of the complete effectiveness of iodothyrin and thyroidin followed the recognition of cachexia thyreopriva."],"Emil Zatopek":["If you want to run, run a mile. If you want to experience a different life, run a marathon.","You can't climb up to the second floor without a ladder. When you set your aim too high and don't fulfill it, then your enthusiasm turns to bitterness. Try for a goal that's reasonable, and then gradually raise it.","Great is the victory, but the friendship of all is greater.","The athlete of today is not an athlete alone. He's the center of a team - doctors, scientists, coaches, agents and so on.","An athlete cannot run with money in his pockets. He must run with hope in his heart and dreams in his head.","We are different, in essence, from other men. If you want to win something, run 100 meters. If you want to experience something, run a marathon.","What has passed is already finished with. What I find more interesting is what is still to come.","If one can stick to the training throughout the many long years, then will power is no longer a problem. It's raining? That doesn't matter. I am tired? That's besides the point. It's simply that I just have to.","A runner must run with dreams in his heart, not money in his pocket.","There is a great advantage in training under unfavorable conditions. It is better to train under bad conditions, for the difference is then a tremendous relief in a race.","Men, today we die a little.","My running was very simple; it was out of myself.","Why should I practice running slow? I already know how to run slow. I want to learn to run fast.","It's at the borders of pain and suffering that the men are separated from the boys.","To boast of a performance which I cannot beat is merely stupid vanity. And if I can beat it that means there is nothing special about it. What has passed is already finished with. What I find more interesting is what is still to come.","When I was young, I was too slow. I thought I must learn to run fast by practicing to run fast, so I ran 100 meters fast 20 times. Then I came back, slow, slow, slow."],"Emile Coue":["Every day, in every way, I'm getting better and better.","When the imagination and will power are in conflict, are antagonistic, it is always the imagination which wins, without any exception."],"Emile Durkheim":["Faith is not uprooted by dialectic proof; it must already be deeply shaken by other causes to be unable to withstand the shock of argument.","Our whole social environment seems to us to be filled with forces which really exist only in our own minds.","To pursue a goal which is by definition unattainable is to condemn oneself to a state of perpetual unhappiness.","Reality seems valueless by comparison with the dreams of fevered imaginations; reality is therefore abandoned.","Sadness does not inhere in things; it does not reach us from the world and through mere contemplation of the world. It is a product of our own thought. We create it out of whole cloth.","Each new generation is reared by its predecessor; the latter must therefore improve in order to improve its successor. The movement is circular.","A society whose members are united by the fact that they think in the same way in regard to the sacred world and its relations with the profane world, and by the fact that they translate these common ideas into common practices, is what is called a Church. In all history, we do not find a single religion without a Church.","If religion has given birth to all that is essential in society, it is because the idea of society is the soul of religion.","The liberal professions, and in a wider sense the well-to-do classes, are certainly those with the liveliest taste for knowledge and the most active intellectual life.","Religious representations are collective representations which express collective realities.","A person is not merely a single subject distinguished from all the others. It is especially a being to which is attributed a relative autonomy in relation to the environment with which it is most immediately in contact.","The roles of art, morality, religion, political faith, science itself are not to repair organic exhaustion nor to provide sound functioning of the organs. All this supraphysical life is built and expanded not because of the demands of the cosmic environment but because of the demands of the social environment.","The human person, whose definition serves as the touchstone according to which good must be distinguished from evil, is considered as sacred, in what one might call the ritual sense of the word. It has something of that transcendental majesty which the churches of all times have given to their Gods.","There is a collective as well as an individual humor inclining peoples to sadness or cheerfulness, making them see things in bright or somber lights. In fact, only society can pass a collective opinion on the value of human life; for this the individual is incompetent.","Each victim of suicide gives his act a personal stamp which expresses his temperament, the special conditions in which he is involved, and which, consequently, cannot be explained by the social and general causes of the phenomenon.","A monomaniac is a sick person whose mentality is perfectly healthy in all respects but one; he has a single flaw, clearly localized. At times, for example, he has an unreasonable and absurd desire to drink or steal or use abusive language; but all his other acts and all his other thoughts are strictly correct.","From the physical point of view, a man is nothing more than a system of cells, or from the mental point of view, than a system of representations; in either case, he differs only in degree from animals.","It is science, and not religion, which has taught men that things are complex and difficult to understand.","One cannot long remain so absorbed in contemplation of emptiness without being increasingly attracted to it. In vain, one bestows on it the name of infinity; this does not change its nature.","It is inadmissible that systems of ideas like religions, which have held so considerable a place in history, and to which, in all times, men have come to receive the energy which they must have to live, should be made up of a tissue of illusions.","The individual can maintain himself in a society definitely organized only through possessing an equally definite mental and moral constitution. This is what the neuropath lacks. His state of disturbance causes him to be constantly taken by surprise by circumstances.","That men have an interest in knowing the world which surrounds them, and consequently that their reflection should have been applied to it at an early date, is something that everyone will readily admit.","The Christian conceives of his abode on Earth in no more delightful colors than the Jainist sectarian. He sees in it only a time of sad trial; he also thinks that his true country is not of this world.","There are two types of men: the great and the small.","Whoever makes an attempt on a man's life, on a man's liberty, on a man's honour inspires us with a feeling of horror in every way analogous to that which the believer experiences when he sees his idol profaned.","It is too great comfort which turns a man against himself. Life is most readily renounced at the time and among the classes where it is least harsh.","Men have been obliged to make for themselves a notion of what religion is, long before the science of religions started its methodical comparisons.","Religious phenomena are naturally arranged in two fundamental categories: beliefs and rites. The first are states of opinion, and consist in representations; the second are determined modes of action.","By definition, sacred beings are separated beings. That which characterizes them is that there is a break of continuity between them and the profane beings.","Man seeks to learn, and man kills himself because of the loss of cohesion in his religious society; he does not kill himself because of his learning. It is certainly not the learning he acquires that disorganizes religion; but the desire for knowledge wakens because religion becomes disorganized.","The fundamental proposition of the apriorist theory is that knowledge is made up of two sorts of elements, which cannot be reduced into one another, and which are like two distinct layers superimposed one upon the other."],"Emile Galle":["Imagining themes that are specific to coating lines, shapes, shades, thoughts, the decoration of our homes and the objects of utility or pure pleasure, adapting its purpose in a material-specific way to metal or wood, marble or fabric - it is, without any doubt, an absorbing occupation.","Each implementation of human effort, however minute the overall result may be, is summed up in the gesture of the sower - sometimes an awe-inspiring gesture.","Any creation of art is conceived and born under influences, amidst the atmosphere of reverie and the most customary volition of the artist. It is there, in any case, that his work arises from.","Do glassmakers not have the ability to knead their own agates, marbles and rock crystals?"],"Emile Hirsch":["There's something about the good-hearted guy fighting the system. I just love that. That's how 'Speed' is. He's a really focused guy with a heart of gold and the corporations are trying to crush him and use him for his skills to make them more money.","Maybe you will be afraid and maybe you will fail, but the courage to take risks in any part of your life is, I feel, a very worthwhile way to live.","I know what wanting and craving adventure feels like, I can really relate to that.","I've realized that what you think of when you make a 'big movie,' if it's actually a green screen movie, it's like doing independent New York theater because you don't have any backgrounds or props. So it's kind of like making the lowest budgeted film you could possibly imagine, plus $100 million.","I identify with someone wanting something to work out, but not being able to get through the rocks to the river.","When I got a lap dance, because I was 17, they had to put a massive pillow between me and the girl when she was grinding me. It was weird, yet pleasurable.","Believe it or not, I got into the charismatic, shady, sly heart of Sedgewick Bell by watching CNN and C-SPAN.","There's something just so kind of smooth about politicians.","I'm not staying away from any genre. I'm trying to get scripts that I like.","I'm a very, very conservative driver.","It was very, very challenging being on this thing called the gimbal. It would throw you around, give you whiplash, and they'd tie you down.","Well, when I was a kid and I watched 'Speed Racer,' I used to always watch it in the morning with my cereal. And when I ate the cereal, I would pour soda into the cereal because we never really had milk for some reason, I don't know.","I was so grateful to have made 'Into the Wild' before I made 'Speed Racer' because on 'Speed Racer' I was indoors every single day, every single scene, on a green screen. Some of the time, just to pass the time, I would think back to climbing mountains in Alaska. That really helped me.","Especially these days where everything is so polite and so proper, I think that rites of passage are good.","If you give an actor any wiggle room to whine in situations where they want to whine, you're gonna whine.","The willingness to keep learning is, I think, the most important thing about trying to be good at anything. You never want to stop learning.","I had the misfortune of getting what skateboarders call hippers. It's when you fall on your hip again and again and again, just the same spot. It turns into like a blue purple bruise and it's just torture because I had to keep on doing the same move, going around in the pool again.","I've definitely had ideas and plans that sometimes exceed my means and capabilities.","How much cooler was Oz than seeing the little dude behind the curtain?","I don't really like the slogan 'It boy.'","I'm not a ball in a pinball machine. I know what I want.","Artistic ambition is important. And it seems it would be a great time to do some theatre, like a new extreme.","In Dogtown, skateboards are like bikes to the Chinese.","I think I've always been half out of my shell and half in. Sometimes I can be extremely wild and sometimes I can be extremely shy. It just depends on the day.","I remember when I saw 'The Matrix' when I was 13, I saw it in the theaters, and I was so blown away by it. It was one of the most memorable experiences I definitely ever had in the theater.","A lot of the stuff in 'Speed Racer' has never been done before, from it having a multi-tone, to it having a retro-cool family movie, to having the photo-realism with the CG-backgrounds and infinite focus the way they worked with these digital cameras, to even the color experimentation.","When you're reading Thoreau you look at Hollywood differently, let me tell ya!","The genres are widening. I don't think that there's as many limitations on the kinds of projects that actors can do as there once was.","On 'Into The Wild' I spent months risking my life and on 'Speed Racer' I spent 60 days acting in front of a green screen. No danger to my physical self, but I sure had to use my imagination.","I don't have an interest in any car that isn't good for the environment, other than maybe an aesthetic quality in a picture book.","'Brokeback Mountain' just blew me away. I'll always remember talking to Heath Ledger just after he finished that movie and he was going on about working with Ang and how incredible he was.","We want to do for 'Hamlet' what Baz Luhrmann did for 'Romeo and Juliet' in terms of like a really cool kind of re-imagining."],"Emile Lahoud":["Democracy, good governance and modernity cannot be imported or imposed from outside a country.","Despair and frustration will not shake our belief that the resistance is the only way of liberation.","People voted with their hearts as they were remembering the father.","The project to settle Palestinians here will be never be approved during my tenure regardless of the price.","There are only two ways to remove the president - if he violates the constitution or commits high treason. How could anyone accuse me of treason after I had terminated Israel's occupation of South Lebanon in 2000.","You know it's easy here to buy journalists."],"Emile M. Cioran":["The Universal view melts things into a blur.","What would be left of our tragedies if an insect were to present us his?","Jealousy - that jumble of secret worship and ostensible aversion.","Since all life is futility, then the decision to exist must be the most irrational of all.","Consciousness is much more than the thorn, it is the dagger in the flesh.","Write books only if you are going to say in them the things you would never dare confide to anyone.","To exist is a habit I do not despair of acquiring.","I foresee the day when we shall read nothing but telegrams and prayers.","A golden rule: to leave an incomplete image of oneself.","Chaos is rejecting all you have learned, chaos is being yourself.","The obsession with suicide is characteristic of the man who can neither live nor die, and whose attention never swerves from this double impossibility.","Revenge is not always sweet, once it is consummated we feel inferior to our victim.","We define only out of despair, we must have a formula... to give a facade tot he void.","Great persecutors are recruited among martyrs whose heads haven't been cut off.","Woes and wonders of Power, that tonic hell, synthesis of poison and panacea.","Skepticism is the sadism of embittered souls.","Criticism is a misconception: we must read not to understand others but to understand ourselves.","Torment, for some men, is a need, an appetite, and an accomplishment.","We are afraid of the enormity of the possible.","We derive our vitality from our store of madness.","Everything is pathology, except for indifference.","Each concession we make is accompanied by an inner diminution of which we are not immediately conscious.","The fear of being deceived is the vulgar version of the quest for Truth.","Tolerance - the function of an extinguished ardor - tolerance cannot seduce the young.","My mission is to kill time, and time's to kill me in its turn. How comfortable one is among murderers.","Every thought derives from a thwarted sensation.","What surrounds us we endure better for giving it a name - and moving on.","It is because we are all imposters that we endure each other.","We understand God by everything in ourselves that is fragmentary, incomplete, and inopportune.","There is no means of proving it is preferable to be than not to be.","One does not inhabit a country; one inhabits a language. That is our country, our fatherland - and no other.","Impossible to spend sleepless nights and accomplish anything: if, in my youth, my parents had not financed my insomnias, I should surely have killed myself.","The fact that life has no meaning is a reason to live - moreover, the only one.","It is not worth the bother of killing yourself, since you always kill yourself too late.","Music is the refuge of souls ulcerated by happiness.","A civilization is destroyed only when its gods are destroyed.","If we could see ourselves as others see us, we would vanish on the spot.","Philosophers write for professors; thinkers for writers.","In every man sleeps a prophet, and when he wakes there is a little more evil in the world.","Life inspires more dread than death - it is life which is the great unknown.","Ennui is the echo in us of time tearing itself apart.","So long as man is protected by madness - he functions - and flourishes.","For you who no longer posses it, freedom is everything, for us who do, it is merely an illusion.","A distant enemy is always preferable to one at the gate.","A marvel that has nothing to offer, democracy is at once a nation's paradise and its tomb.","To venture upon an undertaking of any kind, even the most insignificant, is to sacrifice to envy.","The more we try to rest ourselves from our Egos, the deeper we sink into it.","Anyone can escape into sleep, we are all geniuses when we dream, the butcher's the poet's equal there.","Sperm is a bandit in its pure state.","Imaginary pains are by far the most real we suffer, since we feel a constant need for them and invent them because there is no way of doing without them.","No one recovers from the disease of being born, a deadly wound if there ever was one.","Speech and silence. We feel safer with a madman who talks than with one who cannot open his mouth.","To want fame is to prefer dying scorned than forgotten.","Progress is the injustice each generation commits with regard to its predecessors.","The mind is the result of the torments the flesh undergoes or inflicts upon itself.","The desire to die was my one and only concern; to it I have sacrificed everything, even death.","Life creates itself in delirium and is undone in ennui.","We die in proportion to the words we fling around us.","Anyone who speaks in the name of others is always an imposter.","Life is possible only by the deficiencies of our imagination and memory.","Man starts over again everyday, in spite of all he knows, against all he knows.","By all evidence we are in the world to do nothing.","Philosophy: Impersonal anxiety; refuge among anemic ideas.","Nothing proves that we are more than nothing.","Truths begin by a conflict with the police - and end by calling them in.","Intelligence flourishes only in the ages when belief withers.","To Live signifies to believe and hope - to lie and to lie to oneself.","We interest others by the misfortune we spread around us.","When we cannot be delivered from ourselves, we delight in devouring ourselves.","Society is not a disease, it is a disaster. What a stupid miracle that one can live in it.","Glory - once achieved, what is it worth?","What does the future, that half of time, matter to the man who is infatuated with eternity?","Who Rebels? Who rises in arms? Rarely the slave, but almost always the oppressor turned slave.","No one can enjoy freedom without trembling.","Our works, whatever they may be, derive from our incapacity to kill or to kill ourselves.","Nothing is so wearing as the possession or abuse of liberty.","A people represents not so much an aggregate of ideas and theories as of obsessions.","One hardly saves a world without ruling it.","Ambition is a drug that makes its addicts potential madmen.","In order to have the stuff of a tyrant, a certain mental derangement is necessary.","We are born to Exist, not to know, to be, not to assert ourselves.","Crime in full glory consolidates authority by the sacred fear it inspires.","If, at the limit, you can rule without crime, you cannot do so without injustices.","In a republic, that paradise of debility, the politician is a petty tyrant who obeys the laws.","What pride to discover that nothing belongs to you - what a revelation.","To act is to anchor in an imminent future, so imminent it becomes almost tangible; to act is to feel you are consubstantial with that future.","Isn't history ultimately the result of our fear of boredom?","We inhabit a language rather than a country.","I'm simply an accident. Why take it all so seriously?","I have no nationality - the best possible status for an intellectual.","The limit of every pain is an even greater pain.","Word - that invisible dagger.","Under each formula lies a corpse.","Our first intuitions are the true ones.","The task of the solitary man is to be even more solitary.","God - a disease we imagine we are cured of because no one dies of it nowadays.","The fanatic is incorruptible: if he kills for an idea, he can just as well get himself killed for one; in either case, tyrant or martyr, he is a monster.","A sudden silence in the middle of a conversation suddenly brings us back to essentials: it reveals how dearly we must pay for the invention of speech.","Negation is the mind's first freedom, yet a negative habit is fruitful only so long as we exert ourselves to overcome it, adapt it to our needs; once acquired it can imprison us.","You are done for - a living dead man - not when you stop loving but stop hating. Hatred preserves: in it, in its chemistry, resides the mystery of life.","We would not be interested in human beings if we did not have the hope of someday meeting someone worse off than ourselves.","Man must vanquish himself, must do himself violence, in order to perform the slightest action untainted by evil."],"Emile Zola":["If you ask me what I came into this life to do, I will tell you: I came to live out loud.","Vines will be planted, corn will spring up, a whole growth of new crops; and people will still fall in love in vintages and harvests yet to come. Life is eternal; it is a perpetual renewal of birth and growth.","The artist is nothing without the gift, but the gift is nothing without work.","People like comfort; that's natural. But as for making money simply for the sake of making it, and giving yourself far more trouble and anxiety to gain it than you can ever get pleasure from it when it's gained, why, as for me, I'd rather sit still and cross my arms.","If I cannot overwhelm with my quality, I will overwhelm with my quantity.","If you shut up truth, and bury it underground, it will but grow.","One forges one's style on the terrible anvil of daily deadlines.","The truth is on the march and nothing will stop it.","The fear of life, the fear of burdens and of duties, of annoyances and of catastrophes! The fear of life, which makes us, through dread of its sufferings, refuse its joys. Ah! I tell you, this cowardliness enrages me; I cannot forgive it. We must live - live a complete life - live all our life.","Keep well; that is the half of wisdom and of happiness.","In my view you cannot claim to have seen something until you have photographed it.","There are two men inside the artist, the poet and the craftsman. One is born a poet. One becomes a craftsman.","I am an artist... I am here to live out loud.","I believe that all is illusion and vanity outside the treasure of truths slowly accumulated, and which will never again be lost. I believe that the sum of these truths, always increasing, will at last confer on man incalculable power and peace, if not happiness. Yes, I believe in the final triumph of life.","I believe that the future of humanity is in the progress of reason through science. I believe that the pursuit of truth, through science, is the divine ideal which man should propose to himself.","Perfection is such a nuisance that I often regret having cured myself of using tobacco.","The thought is a deed. Of all deeds she fertilizes the world most.","In Paris, everything's for sale: wise virgins, foolish virgins, truth and lies, tears and smiles.","One must be arrogant, indeed, to imagine that one can take everything in one's hand and know everything!","Up to this day, there has been no proof of the existence of any intelligence other than the human.","I am little concerned with beauty or perfection. I don't care for the great centuries. All I care about is life, struggle, intensity.","The fate of animals is of greater importance to me than the fear of appearing ridiculous; it is indissolubly connected with the fate of men.","Selling beauty is something I can understand. Even selling false beauty seems perfectly natural; it's a sign of progress.","When people have not the same ideas, it is certainly better not to talk about them.","I defy you to find any real will, any reasoning force, outside of life. And everything is there; there is, in the world, no other will than this force which impels everything to life, a life even broader and higher."],"Emilia Clarke":["I long for the countryside. That's where I get my calm and tranquillity - from being able to come and find a spot of green.","There are no captions on red-carpet photos that say, 'This girl trained for two weeks, she went on a juice diet, she has a professional hair and makeup person, and this dress was made for her.' I just wish they'd say, 'It ain't the truth.'","I think the reason why strong women have such a powerful impact is that you've got the strength of a man with the heart and sensitivity of a woman.","If you spend too much time wondering what you're going to feel like in year five, you're not going to feel anything in year one.","You come from a happy family; you want to create a happy family.","My father always said, 'Never trust anyone whose TV is bigger than their book shelf' - so I make sure I read.","A young Brit girl with no theatre experience decided to take on an iconic American role on Broadway. Maybe I should have thought that through?","Croatia has been glorious - it's so beautiful, and I want to go back as often as I can.","Music is something that's always been a huge part of my life.","No talent lies in my dancing.","My mother taught me how to apply my own makeup at 13 years old, and the most important lesson I learned is to never touch my eyebrows and to cleanse, tone, and moisturize twice a day.","I'm just a girl who loves mascara.","I came out of my mum's stomach going, 'I want to be an actor!'","You can't come out of drama school and think, 'It's all going to be amazing.' You have to expect to work in a bar for at least five years and be a waitress for maybe two!","American naturalism is what my indulgent actor side loves: a bit of Tennessee Williams, a bit of Clifford Odets, August Wilson - I would just love to tackle some of that.","After my last audition for 'Game of Thrones,' they said, 'Congratulations, princess.' I was like, 'Bye-bye, call centre.'","One of the first houses we lived in was like out of a fairy story. We had a stream that ran through our garden, and we played with the ducks - we locked them in my mum's office, and they pooed everywhere. It was crazy, picking blackberries and mushrooms, rabbits running through your legs.","My favorite Hepburn moment is in 'Sabrina,' when she steps off a boat in white shorts and a plaid shirt. Chic, classic, and unfussy.","You have to do whatever jobs you can to pay the rent.","I told my parents I wanted to be an actor, and they were getting ready for a life of unemployment, so they're just happy I'm in work!","All of the press and stuff - that's the scary stuff. The acting is what I got trained to do.","Drama school is fundamentally practical. I didn't write any essays, so I came out with a BA honors degree in acting.","My life is unrecognisable compared to what it was - 'Game of Thrones' has opened doors that were never there before. But it can be dangerous to see it in those terms, I think. It's best to take it as it comes and work as hard as you can, and hopefully the other things fall into place.","My rule is never to look at anything on the Internet.","The '90s were really just bad for fashion and hair.","I'd give my right arm to be, like, a random extra on 'Girls,' just to walk past one of the scenarios. I'd love that more than anything.","Being a single girl in New York... it's what you should be doing in your twenties!","I spent most of my life watching HBO series wishing that at some point in my career I might be able to work with them.","I grew up around horses, but acting and riding on camera is a whole different thing.","I looked around one stage school when I was maybe nine. It just scared the bejesus out of me. I was incredibly open, and the girls seemed fierce and determined.","I've read all the 'Game of Thrones' books many times over, so I sometimes find it easier being on set, because it can be hard to get out of character.","Any opportunity to get into fashion and find a beautiful dress, I'm very definitely excited about that.","I do love singing. I wouldn't say I'm any good, but I definitely love it - especially jazz singing.","I think 'Game Of Thrones' is incredibly true to the books. I think the fans will, hopefully, be very pleased with how true to the books we are.","I'm really old-fashioned. An Epsom salt bath, that's genuinely better than any massage.","I think as a woman it's in our nature to nurture someone else. Sometimes at the expense of ourselves.","My dad's a sound designer, and he used to take me to work with him.","I have very sensitive skin, so I have to care for it properly.","My mother taught me to cleanse, tone, and moisturize twice a day, so I always do that - I could be partying or working late, but I'm never too tired to take care of my skin.","I wear tinted moisturized since, on the stage, we tend to wear such heavy stage makeup.","I actually don't get massages very much. But Epsom salt baths are better than any massage.","When I was in my teens, I thought, 'Would I like to try and work hard at being an actor, or do I want to work hard at doing something musical?' Acting won out, but I do really enjoy those moments where I get to just belt something out.","When I'm on stage, I feel very much at home - within a theater, within an ensemble - so this entire process is something I feel very attuned with.","One of the shows I would very much love to be a part of is 'Mad Men' - walking around that office.","The calibre of TV's changing. It's becoming much more epic. To rival film, definitely.","I learned more doing 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' than I did during three years at drama school.","My dad took me for an audition once, to show me, 'OK, you want to be a child actor, this is what it's like.' I sang a folk song about donkeys on this West End stage with this big director, and there was a queue of 200 girls all singing 'Memory.' I was terrible. Terrible.","Personally, I'd like as many children as I can pop out, I reckon.","I don't get much studio stuff. I'm usually on location, and I know that some people think that acting is so glamorous, but believe me, it's not!","Living in London as a student is tough. And my heart goes out to every single drama student in London because, as an actor, it's a creative process that you are taking on, and if you don't get to do it every day, it hurts.","Never in a million years did I think 'Game of Thrones' was going to take off like it did.","I tried a robin heart once. It wasn't very good.","Valyrian is oddly easier than Dothraki. It's got a more lyrical flow to it that feels more familiar to the way I speak. That makes it slightly easier.","'Elizabeth' is something I've looked to a lot for a strong female leader.","I owe absolutely everything to HBO.","My normal stuff is Dr. Perricone's hypoallergenic range. I have incredibly sensitive skin, so I struggled to find anything because my skin would react to so much stuff.","Me and heels are very good friends.","I find that a lot of the good acting comes out when you're physically being pushed: your brain turns off and just deals with the situation at hand. You get to a point where you're exhausted at the end of the day, but I quite like that."],"Emilia Fox":["I never feel lonely if I've got a book - they're like old friends. Even if you're not reading them over and over again, you know they are there. And they're part of your history. They sort of tell a story about your journey through life.","I was quite shy when I was younger, but I'm not one of those people who can complain of a bad childhood or any trauma. There was none in my life. I had a wonderfully happy childhood.","When I go into the garden, I forget everything. It's uncomplicated in my world of gardening. It's trial and error, really. If something doesn't work, it comes out, and you start all over again.","My mother was very ill when I was 18. She had a brain operation and then a nervous breakdown. It's very strange when you see your parents, who have always been your pillars of strength, suddenly become vulnerable. You don't know whether to be angry that they are not strong or devastated.","Older men are wiser and that is much cooler to me. I've never been one for going out clubbing or getting off my head, so I always gravitated to men who were similar. They just tended to be older. I think you have more of an adventure with an older man. And a happier journey.","When I was four, we had to choose a musical instrument to play at school, and I chose the cello. I played until I was 18, and although I found it nerve-racking to play solo, I loved playing in an orchestra. When I left school I didn't carry on with it, which I regret.","My parents instilled a really good work ethic from when I was little - if you want to have money to spend on holidays, you earn it. So I've always been someone who wanted to be able to survive by myself, but I think you have to let down the barriers a little bit - let other people in.","I met Jack Nicholson when I was about 10 at a party of my uncle's, and it wasn't so much that I knew his films because I was small, but he wore sunglasses inside at night and I thought that must mean he was very important and was suitably star struck by his charismatic presence.","I just get up and live my life for today - try and deal with it as it comes.","I am a single mother - that is the reality.","My grandmother, Angela, was the Fox family matriarch. She was magnetic but also wicked. She had this huge life force and was great fun, but she would play each member of the family off against each other, which could make for extremely dramatic Christmases.","I have a heart tattoo on the inside of my middle finger on my left hand.","Only out of great vulnerability do you discover what strength you have. Having a daughter who I love with all my being has helped me mine the source of that strength to previously unknown depths.","I've always been brought up to stand on my own two feet and not rely too heavily on everyone else around me.","I'm the joke of the family with cooking because I've never done it - primarily because I've been surrounded by people who are so good at it. Mum's brilliant. Boyfriends have always been good at it. I'm waiting for my inner chef to be released.","I'd really like to visit India and South America. I think India will be a great mix of sightseeing and relaxing, and I've got a feeling it will also be good for one's soul and spirit. And I'd love to go backpacking around South America at some point. I did that in Australia when I was younger, and the camaraderie was great fun.","I read all the Agatha Christies when I was younger and like Sherlock Holmes. Crime fiction has always fascinated me, but I'll read anything anyone gives me.","I love the instantaneous nature of filming rather than the repetition of working in the theatre, but that maybe because I haven't had great experiences working in the theatre.","I was an only child for 15 years and then this lovely present, Fred, came along. It was great - it meant I had my teenage years with a little one around.","In acting, every day is different, and I guess it appeals to my storytelling imagination. But I've been very fortunate to get the chance to do what I want to do and earn a living from it to pay the mortgage.","I suppose my life has always been about pleasing people, making sure they're all right, doing the right thing. Then, suddenly, you have to face up to what you want and be honest about it.","I'm not very good at time off. I'm happier when I'm working. It's something to do with not knowing what the next job is, so you appreciate it while it's there. I thrive on it, actually. But now I do it to please myself.","I am too much of a control freak to be a drinker.","I made it to Oxford, but it is not that I am particularly clever, much more that I am a worker bee.","I've always had an enormous sense of independence. But I know that sometimes I can be too independent. It is important to be able to share your life - so that is a work in progress for me.","I didn't realise my upbringing was unusual until my teens. As the child of two actors, I presumed that visiting film sets and being surrounded by colourful characters was normal.","When I was growing up, I wanted to be my half-sister Lucy. She was 14 years older than me and was impossibly glamorous. I grew up in awe of her.","The difficulty with film is you always have to consign a story to being a certain length, whereas with a book you don't have budget constraints; you can cast it yourself.","Every day I fantasise about situations and little themes I see in front of me that would make a good beginning of a story. But one has to be disciplined and just sit down and do it.","On my own or with a friend, I'm a shopaholic, and I particularly love the cleaning aisle in the supermarket. But when I'm with my husband, I'm shop shy because he can't bear it. It always ends up with us making a huge scene on the High Street and then going off in a huff in separate directions.","I've always believed in trying to be as open as possible. I think it almost comes with the job - if you can bare your emotions, it makes for better acting.","I'm not crazy about having lots of time to myself. Whenever I come back from filming away, I immediately want to go and see my friends and my family and re-establish my life. I can fill time when I'm alone, but I love being around other people.","People think of me as a privileged young girl born to wear a chiffon party dress. I was born into a big acting family, and although I absolutely adore them, it's taken me time to work out how or where I feel comfortable.","My parents never pressured me except to advise me against acting.","Being a mum is the best thing that has ever been given to me in my life."],"Emilia Wickstead":["To escape and sit quietly on the beach - that's my idea of paradise.","It is important that every bride feels comfortable in her chosen dress, and fabric choice has a big part to play in this.","I love wearing interesting shoes that work well with my outfit.","Red lipstick aside, I firmly believe that less is more in terms of make-up.","I strongly believe that many of the best decisions are made on gut instinct.","I am a little obsessed with stripes.","I love seeing a woman in a beautiful dress and pairing it with a light shoe that shows skin - I really believe in toe cleavage.","I feel far more empowered, sophisticated, and forward-thinking in flats than in high heels. Especially when I am working and hosting meetings.","Here in London, you can go for picnics and have a barbecue; you can go to a park and wear bare feet, much like New Zealand. But there's just so much buzz going on; you can be inspired by anything and everything. There's always something to do. Always.","We're creating a brand image which didn't exist in the beginning, and I want to grow that. And in the way that the clothes and services we offer are a luxurious niche, I want to be doing that with accessories.","I attended speech and drama classes with a nun to help me gain confidence in speaking without my face turning red each time.","I was very aware of the fact that I was a young designer, and I didn't want to fall into the trap of 'mother of the bride' dressing and 'occasion-wear.' I wanted to make sure that girls my age were wearing it and that there was a cool factor to my clothes.","Old images and films are my main source of inspiration.","As for design, I gravitate to traditional styles but mix it with an element of surprise. Whether it's a big sash bow in the back or an unexpected fabric, it all needs to work together.","The AW14 collection is inspired by Film Noir. Elements of masculinity and femininity were reflected in the fabric, tailoring, and features.","I feel like British designers are having a real moment; there's a lot of freedom to be different, and I think that that's what so unique. There's no expectation of what you're going to see at London Fashion Week, and I think that's why you get such a mixed bag of sweets.","Skincare is incredibly important. I try to look after my skin as much as possible because I'm always inspired by women who age gracefully and naturally.","It's quite funny. I grew up with my mother: as a designer, she was always working, and I actually used to say to her, 'Whatever you do, never leave me your business.'","There is so much talent in British fashion: a real cookie jar of different aesthetics with designers like Mary Katrantzou, Erdem, Christopher Kane, J. W. Anderson, and Simone Rocha.","The most wonderful thing about having a small business is that every person we dress gets a really intimate process.","I want to offer a wide range of classic and contemporary bridalwear to suit all personalities, readily available to try on.","I wore one of my own designs on my wedding day.","It's about having that nice balance. I think that's the answer to today's modern girl who is on the run. She's throwing on something before she goes out, but I still believe in the glitz and the glamour of everything and making that come to life.","I don't like the word 'ladylike.'","I was so young when I started, my taste has changed and developed, and I've gone from being a little bit safe to trying different things.","I don't come from family money, and neither does my husband.","It's almost like a chintzy floral that I play on, and sometimes it can get a bad rep. It doesn't necessarily feel modern, but with different silhouettes and cuts, it can.","I saw a niche in the market where made-to-measure wasn't being done in a modern, fresh way or in a short period of time. Traditionally, bespoke orders take a very long time, but I thought, 'Here we are with all these fashion-forward ideas - why not?'","I put myself into another world and another identity, and I design not for how my life is but for how my imaginary life is.","A lot of people ask, 'How did you start the business, and how did you do it money-wise?' And the truth is that I had three jobs. A day job, an evening job, and then designing my collection as well. That's just how we did it.","If I'd really known how hard I was going to have to work behind the scenes to have any kind of business, I think I would have stopped.","My grandmother, Amalia Pia Emilia Vignola, whom I called Nonna, brought out the fairy tale in everything. She used to tuck me into bed so vigorously that I never felt anything less than comforted, and then afterwards, she would sit on a cane basket box next to my bed and read Hans Christian Andersen to me.","My father, Dennis Popham, was a very handsome, talented artist, and as my mother always reminds me, 'someone who had wonderful style.' He was half Samoan-German, half New Zealander, and their first date was to a Fleetwood Mac concert, which I love the thought of.","From the age of 11, I was taught the importance of earning my own money. I would babysit, walk dogs, clean cars, and work at the local corner shop and the butcher's. If I wanted to buy something, I always bought it myself.","There are many bespoke services in the U.K., but everything's quite old-fashioned. There wasn't anything young and modern and fresh. We're this young service, where a 25-year-old might come and get some great skirts and her mum could come in for some linens.","I would not dress Katie Price. Ever. It's important to keep the right look, so it's important to be dressing the right people.","I'd like to think we can make a nice, glowing change to British dressing.","New Zealand is such a down-to-earth place.","I always think about my lifestyle when designing, so that's being a mother, being a career woman, being a wife, and being a woman who loves to entertain.","I would've loved to dress Diana Vreeland. I just loved her work as a creative woman and as a business woman - unpredictable, exciting, fun, and very, very clever.","What's exciting for me is to make sure that people do still dress up - how do we do that in this fast-paced modern world, when we're all on the move and all so busy?","I'd say I play on old world couture as opposed to modern day bridal; there's something very timeless and appealing in that.","We do have a lot of personal relationships with people who will come to our store or showroom.","The minute that a celebrity wears your clothing, that gives you international exposure and the best advertising you can get.","I don't think there's any excuse for not being able to put on a beautiful product and make yourself feel fabulous. Just have some key pieces in your wardrobe that aren't seasonal.","There's a great niche in the market for what I do, which is effortless style.","The majority of our clients are British. They want to wear things time and time again.","I love the idea of a dress or a coatdress rather than a suit with a jacket.","I love doing fittings and seeing women look really confident in their clothes because they're not wearing something too boxy but that really shows off their figures. Everybody has a different figure - it's important to design for different shapes.","I think that the typical Emilia Wickstead women is very effortless, very sophisticated: she's got alluring style, and she's always taking on fashion. I always describe her as 'imaginative with her own taste'.","I like to think that people are buying Emilia Wickstead because they want to keep it in their wardrobe as an investment piece; she's not just buying it because it's of the moment or what's currently in season.","I think that we cater for the woman that wants to be fashion-forward but also wants to purchase an investment piece that she'll have in her wardrobe forever.","I have clients from 19 to 80 years old, and the way I work means that they can take the same dress and shorten, lengthen it, remove the sleeve, adjust details - and make it their own. They get a piece that is right for them. It's a clever way of shopping in this economy.","I never get my hair done. I just do it myself.","Once, four friends and I cut all our hair off, like boys. A couple of them cried afterwards, but I thought we looked really good.","I love everything I design.","In the day, I wear mascara and tinted moisturiser - although I've learnt that if I'm getting my photograph taken, it's better to apply more; otherwise, I look really, really tired.","The message I want to put forward for women is that I never want it to be about, 'Oh, it's a bit difficult to put that together,' or, 'She can dress that way, but I can't.' Actually, my designs are for all women, and I truly believe that you can make yourself feel wonderful in whatever you wear. That's the importance behind what I design.","It's a huge achievement to have anyone wearing your clothes, and when they are in the limelight, it's the best advertisement for your brand.","I'm always designing for that sort of dressed-up woman who likes to go to different occasions, who's career focused, but she entertains in the evening... a very sophisticated-feeling working woman who likes to have fun.","I'm always doing everything backwards.","Prada Infusion d'Iris perfume - my mother wears it, so it feels like home away from home. It's lovely to smell her scent at all times.","I enjoy going for brunch at Granger & Co. in Notting Hill and having my all-time favourite: poached eggs and avocado on toast. I love the aesthetic of the space and the fresh, modern approach in the dishes.","I love the cleanness of Kaare Klint and Rud Rasmussen furniture, especially the wooden criss-cross under-bars of their sofas.","My grandmother has strongly influenced my approach to beauty. She has always cared for her skin by cleansing and washing her face with warm water in the morning. At all times, she has lipstick on and her face is immaculately powdered - she follows the same routine to this day and looks great at 94.","There is nothing more beautiful than personality wrinkles.","The first wedding dress I ever made was for myself. It was at a time when I had my business up and running, but it was still very early days, and I thought, 'This is my moment to do whatever I like.'","My wedding dress was featured by 'Vogue' and 'American Town and Country,' and from there, people started to come to us because they had seen that dress.","When I think of Bicester, I think of those beautiful pieces that you might not have been able to purchase before, but they're pieces that you'll keep forever.","My autumn/winter 2011-12 collection embodies the bold and beautiful while reflecting an innovative style and passion for immaculate design. I believe that this collection radiates modern femininity and beauty in its purest form.","The Emilia Wickstead customer is a sophisticated, accomplished woman who expresses her femininity and style through the way she dresses. She appreciates classic with a twist, yet luxurious and high quality clothing that make her feel confident, elegant, and ultimately chic.","I've had women buy their entire wardrobes from me; from suits to full-length evening gowns and sophisticated day dresses, they buy everything.","My clients can choose their own colours and fabrics to have something unique in their wardrobes.","You can see that ladylike kind of dressing with a twist coming back at Dior, and I think that a lot of the fashion is following in those kinds of footsteps. It's wearable. It sits in your wardrobe forever.","I think I'm starting to be a little bit more appreciated or a little bit more noticed in the industry."],"Emiliano Salinas":["Fear is better than apathy because fear makes us do something.","I was born in 1976. I grew up in a traditional Mexican family. As a child, I had a pretty normal life: I would go to school, play with my friends and cousins. But then my father became President of Mexico, and my life changed.","I was born in Mexico, I grew up in Mexico, and along the way, I learned to love Mexico. I think anyone who has stepped foot on this land - not to mention all Mexican people - will agree that it's not difficult to love Mexico.","Let's think about Mexican streets: they're unsafe because of violence, so people stay at home. Does that make streets more or less safe? Less safe! So streets become more desolate and unsafe, so we stay home more - which makes streets even more desolate and unsafe, and we stay home even more.","I think the biggest insult, the worst way you can offend a Mexican, is to insult their mother. A mother is the most sacred thing in life."],"Emiliano Zapata":["It is better to die on your feet than to live on your knees."],"Emilie Autumn":["Being brave means to know something is scary, difficult, and dangerous, and doing it anyway, because the possibility of winning the fight is worth the chance of losing it.","I'm bipolar, but I'm not crazy, and I never was. I'm stark raving sane.","If you're going to die, then die. If you're going to live, then fight.","It is not seen as insane when a fighter, under an attack that will inevitable lead to his death, chooses to take his own life first. In fact, this act has been encouraged for centuries, and is accepted even now as an honorable reason to do the deed. How is it any different when you are under attack by your own mind?","I am my heart's undertaker. Daily I go and retrieve its tattered remains, place them delicately into its little coffin, and bury it in the depths of my memory, only to have to do it all again tomorrow.","I was initially signed to a German label a few years ago.","I'm a big stupid history nerd.","I've been completely fascinated with history because it tells everything about what's going to happen next because it's cyclical, everything repeats in general.","I love to write and to get to know the people who are listening.","I've learned that I work best when I'm entirely naked. The recording process was done that way."],"Emilie de Ravin":["Love is such an objective thing. I mean, I can say I love my family, or I love my Diet Coke. So I guess, in different ways, yeah, I do believe in love.","If you're getting ready to do a really emotional scene then, right before it, you're probably not going to be outside playing basketball.","I love New York. I've always loved New York.","I always try and take something from each job.","I always felt like I was born in the wrong time period. I felt like I should've been born in the mid-to-late '40s.","I'd like to play with a period piece. Playing a girl next door in 2010 is so different from playing one in 1950, the way you talk, walk, dress, relationships. It's really fun studying all that.","My earliest memory is seeing Michael Jackson in Melbourne with my sister when I was about ten. I still have this souvenir stick with a glove that would light up and make a peace sign in a bunch of different colors. I'm so happy my mom didn't throw that out.","I don't know if I really watched any Disney animation as a kid.","I think the simpler it is when you have a crazy character to play is almost more creepy and interesting.","I do love children, but I don't really talk about that in auditions.","I get recognised, but I'm not the sort of person who frequents popular clubs. I try to keep out of that.","I'm kind of a homebody. I like to sit at home and watch movies and eat good food."],"Emilio Ambasz":["I was born in Argentina, June 13, 1943. I brought up my parents very well, so they let me come to America to study at Princeton University.","Princeton is a sublime undergraduate university. It has a good architecture school.","My first architectural project I did, I must have been fifteen, was for neighbors across the street, a couple of school teachers, and I designed a house for them. I didn't know anything about Le Corbusier or anything like that, but it ended up being a very cubistic kind of house. I always wanted to be an architect.","Argentina is a marvelous place. Argentines are great bankers of information. They import information; if someone sneezes in Milan or in New York, they clean their faces very fast there."],"Emilio Azcarraga Jean":["I believe that there's good content or bad content. You see interviews when somebody interviews a director of a movie that didn't perform well in the box office, and he says, 'The audience didn't understand my movie.' If people didn't go to buy the ticket, then you did the wrong movie.","Soccer is the most difficult business that we're in, because one day you're on top, and the next day you're very low.","If 'Titanic' was one of our telenovelas, we would probably have added a pair of dolphins to save Jack at the end. We don't kill the good guy.","Democracy is a good client."],"Emilio Estevez":["We don't think about pilgrimage in this country. We don't think about meditation. The idea of taking a six-week walk is totally foreign to most Americans. But it's probably exactly what we need.","There is a part of me that still wants to go out and grab a backpack and unplug - not take a cellphone or even a camera and just get out there and experience the world and travel. I have yet to do that, but someday I hope.","Madrid is enjoyed most from the ground, exploring your way through its narrow streets that always lead to some intriguing park, market, tapas bar or street performer. Each night we'd leave our hotel to begin a new adventure in Madrid and nine out of 10 times, we'd walk through the Plaza Mayor.","Film is an illusion. Fame is ephemeral. Faith and family are what endure.","I think I've matured to a great extent. I think that I want different things now. That it's not about the celebrity status that you receive because you're doing the next hot movie. It's about doing good work.","You look at 1968 and it was truly the year that shook the world. The world was really completely upside down.","In making certain things easier for people, technology has actually demotivated people from using their brains. We have all these devices that keep us connected, and yet we're more disconnected than ever before. Why is that?","I'm a wonderful disaster. So are you. We're all a mess. We're in this culture that says take this pill and you'll be happy, go on this diet and you'll be thinner, have your teeth whitened, people will love you more.","Where people are now in terms of the economic crisis, they're looking at what we think is the bottom, and I think that's when people look to film and to spirituality.","What I find interesting is that the people that follow your Twitters are called 'followers.' Talk about false idolatry, right?","We need to risk, we need to dare to risk and fail greatly because that's the only way we grow.","We've lost touch and allowed technology to take precedence over organic nature. But let's not forget that those microchips in our computers came from elements of the earth.","Writing is a lonely job unless you're a drinker, in which case you always have a friend within reach.","We get very set in our ways and it's sometimes hard to look beyond what else is out there.","What does it take to get you to the point where you have to kill your brother? It's biblical, it's huge. It's so personal.","I have a problem with objectifying women, but I don't have a problem playing a guy who objectifies women.","The first couple of pictures I wrote and directed were dreadful, because I was dealing in worlds that were not familiar to me, and writing about fantasy. They were just not anything I was really connected to.","People are beautiful wrecks.","You know, we're a tight family. I live right down the street from my folks. I talk to my mother every day. I'm a momma's boy. We all are. So there's no exclusion in this family. You're part of it. We embrace you and lift you up.","I believe the death of Bobby Kennedy was in many ways the death of decency in America. I think it was the death of manners and formality, the death of poetry and the death of a dream.","By definition, I believe I am unapologetically optimistic and I am unapologetically earnest.","When people ask what were the qualities of Bobby Kennedy that they most admired, it was first that he was tough. Second, he told the truth and third, he stood up for the little guy.","My mother missed having dinner with Lyndon Johnson because she couldn't find the right hat to wear. While my father went off to the white house to break bread with the President, my mother, who's not a things and stuff person, stayed at the hotel and tried on 10 different hats and missed dinner.","Americans are probably more in line than ever before. We're more moderate than we are liberal or conservative.","Spiritually, we're all on a path. I haven't declared of defined myself because as soon as you declare yourself you're identifying with a certain dogma.","All the crap that we've encumbered our lives with, it's really meaningless.","I'm not a Luddite, but I'm outside more than I'm on my computer. We have a micro-farm - it's a step up from a garden. We have a pretty extensive vineyard. We grow about 60 percent of our own food, make our own wine, have chickens for eggs.","You make a film and you don't know who it's going to appeal to.","In the current climate, we live in a pessimistic and non-idealistic world.","A biopic would have required hiring an actor, and I always wanted to just let Bobby be Bobby. My thought was it would make it a more universal story to focus on ordinary people rather than this extraordinary man.","We're a very close family and we're a very real family, and I think every real family has real problems.","There is no doubt that directing television has helped hone my directing skills. What television teaches you is to be efficient and to think on your feet. You have to adhere to strict deadlines and budget constraints.","I saw a headshot with the name 'Emilio Sheen' printed under it and it looked terrible.","This is one of the benefits, as well as one of the difficulties of directing a member of your family. You know where the buttons are. You can push them if you want.","Since the beginning of time, every child on the planet has endeavored to please their parents.","I still have the art projects my kids made for me 20 years ago. I cherish them, crude and silly as some of them may be.","We're all imperfect. And wouldn't it be great if the message sent out by the mainstream media is that we're fine being exactly who we are? Wouldn't that be great for everyone?","If only media people would stop reaching for the low-hanging fruit, which is cynicism and pessimism, and stopped trying so hard to be hip and cool and have a swagger.","I probably grow half my food. It's a good way to keep perspective.","The first time I had sat down to a meal I had grown on my own, along with a bottle of wine that we had made, I burst into tears. To be in touch and be in tune with that is an extraordinary gift.","Literally, if someone says I am grounded, everyday I am at home, I actually have my hands in the ground and dirt under my fingernails. I don't have a staff to do it all for me. I still plant a seed and I'm amazed it grows."],"Emilio Pucci":["Gaiety is one of the most important elements I brought to fashion. I brought it through color.","When a man has seen the aerodynamic shape of a Caravelle jet at an airport, he doesn't need aerodynamic furniture."],"Emily Alyn Lind":["I have a really small puppy, Georgie, and one of my favorite things is to take her to the park and play with her. I take two classes at middle school, math and chorus, and I love walking home with her after school.","You can have fun, but when it is time to work, work hard and be focused.","I actually like older horror movies more than newer ones because when I'm watching newer ones, like 'Chucky' or 'Saw' or whatever, I'm like, 'Come on, really, this isn't even good, all it is is blood and knives.' I like when it has a story line, you know? When it's actually a movie.","I'm lucky to have worked with all the people that I have, and I really love what I do, and that is very important, too."],"Emily Berrington":["Little girls as children, I think, are expected to behave better. If a boy's naughty at school, he's a little bit cheeky and mischievous. If a girl's naughty, she's trouble.","I always thought that at the very time of your life when you want to be cool and sexy and fascinating, you are none of those things. You are a hormonal muddle in your school uniform sitting in double science looking at a boy who you know will never notice you. That was definitely me; I was so shy at school.","I had a brilliant trip to Mexico with my friend Ellie during my gap year. We thought we were being really cool and going off the beaten track while all our friends went to Thailand and Australia. The first beachside bar we walked into - there were two girls from my sixth form in there.","Politics is terrifying, very masculine, and not particularly encouraging to young blonde women - as a career, that is - and it was only when I was working in parliament that I thought to myself, 'Well, this is a tough industry; can an acting career be any more intimidating?' and I applied to drama school.","You imagine that, going into such a huge American series, you will come up against a lot of egos, but it was the complete opposite on '24,' a dream team.","I will be very sad if I ever get to the point where I think, 'Oh no, another dress from Armani.' I want to be still screaming my head off when it arrives.","When I was little, I was actually really shy. I really enjoyed doing school plays, but I found the whole thing terrifying. I cried myself to sleep once because I thought my teacher was going to give me the lead role. I never imagined acting was a viable career.","My first role was an angel in the nursery nativity. I spotted my mum halfway through and shouted over someone else's lines to ask if she liked my costume. I've learnt not to do that now.","I really enjoy working with people who have come into this industry for what I think are really admirable reasons. People who really want to tell brilliant stories and do it in the most effective way possible.","Auditioning for something you already know and love is terrifying.","I was really into '24' at university, and it resulted in a lot of lost hours that could have been spent at the library. If you could have told me then I would be in it one day, I'd have hit the roof.","I never thought I'd end up doing comedy, but actually, it's been something I've really relished the challenge of and ended up doing quite a bit of.","I did a geography degree, and if you told me whilst I was ignoring my geography degree revision in order to watch another episode of '24' that one day I wouldn't need that geography degree and I'd actually be in '24,' I'd have been quite pleased, I think.","I literally can't talk without moving hands.","I think 'Humans' has massively improved me as an actor.","I've been reading a lot about what the Internet does to our brains.","I literally can't get anywhere now without the map on my phone. I used to use an A-Z when I first came to London, and now I really struggle because there's no dot to show where I am. And I think that part of my brain doesn't work any more.","There's a fine line between something saving you time and replacing a bit of you that could be useful. I've certainly become more and more aware of that.","I read recently that someone set up a Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Robots in America. The idea being that if something robotic can have responsibilities then it should also have rights.","You don't want to disappoint, or feel like you're trying to recreate the magic of something.","I've never loved a character as much as I do Niska. The way she's been written is so complex, with huge amounts of light and dark. It's a really satisfying challenge to play someone who is superhuman in their intelligence and physical ability but completely naive when it comes to certain aspects of life.","As far as I'm aware, you can't tell if something is going to be successful. Brilliant scripts often don't get picked up, and terrible ones do all the time!","I knew, the second I read 'Humans,' that no matter how successful the show was, the script was superb and like nothing else I'd ever seen.","Even things like supermarket self-checkouts, they do mean people's jobs go. It's always worth thinking about the implications of things. Just because something's easier, it doesn't mean that it's the right thing to do.","I imagine if you're one of those genius people working on AI, the desire to find out what's possible is presumably the driving factor, but I hope there are just as many people who are thinking about what we actually want. Just because something's possible it doesn't mean it's going to be good to us.","I'm really rubbish with technology; I'm super backward! I think I got a mobile phone last out of all my friends. I really worried about people being able to get hold of me at any time - I really hated that idea.","I do think I have a lesser ability to remember facts and names than I have done previously, because you never have to store them; you just look them up again. I could make the same recipe 15 times, but I'll never, ever remember how to make it because I'll just look it up.","I definitely, really appreciate that quality that humans like to show constantly, even without saying anything, that they're with you and they're processing something.","It's my dream career to do as many different things as possible and for as long as possible, to stretch myself in as many different directions as I can.","A family is definitely in my future, but I have no idea when. I don't know how people fit it in with an acting career, but they do. Katherine Parkinson is a great example of that, so I'll have to ask her.","I'm old and boring in London and get really tired around midnight. But in Berlin, I had this new lease of life because there's something electric about the place.","You meet people and go, 'We're going to be friends forever!' then you get home and can't even remember their name.","I am more on the side of humans than robots.","If there is an option to use a real human being and to have a chat with somebody and do your shopping that way, I do try and do that.","I worry that if you see a row of self-checkouts, you think, 'That all used to be jobs and real people.'","'Humans' would definitely score really well on the Bechdel test - the one that tracks how well represented women are in drama.","I've taken that with me since working with him; in order to be William Hurt, you have use every moment like he does.","Luckily, most days filming, for me, have involved a bit of a workout, too.","I love the make-up trailer. It's a great way to start the day, drinking coffee and singing along to Elvis with the make-up artists. They work wonders on a very sleepy face.","A standard day usually starts very early - 4.30 A.M. pick-ups and in the make-up chair by 5.30.","I was not a queen bee, ever."],"Emily Bett Rickards":["I was always very physical, growing up, and did sports. I like to get out and do different things, and walk in different shoes. I like change. I like challenge.","I'm always interested to meet my friends' parents, or who they were raised by. Where they grew up, I always find very interesting."],"Emily Blunt":["I used to look like a deer in headlights on the red carpet. You step out of the car and it's bedlam. Everyone's got crazy eyes.","People quit on jobs. They quit on marriages. They quit on school. There's an immediacy of this day and age that doesn't lend itself to being committed to anything.","I'm not much of a crier but it is mildly soul-destroying and exposing to do something physical that you are terrible at in front of other people.","There is absolutely, 100 percent, a light at the end of the tunnel for anyone who stutters.","The performances I enjoy are the ones that are hard to read or ambiguous or left-of-centre because it makes you look closer and that's what humans are like - quite mysterious creatures, hard to pinpoint.","I'm not someone who likes to plan too much ahead.","It's sort of a meat market, the whole awards thing, and I don't think you can predict it anymore - who's going to like what you've done, if it's worthy or not. And hopefully, that's not why you make a film, because if you're distracted by that, or only striving for that, you don't do it justice.","It's very hard to play the straight lead girl and still make her sparkly and fun and real.","You can go at the premiere it's at Disneyland.","I appreciate a slow-burn romance. In most movies, everyone is just tearing their clothes off in the first scene.","With Ricky Gervais, it's all shades of wrong, it's my kind of humor.","I want to find something really wonderful to do next and take my time to search through the dearth of great material, especially for women.","I'm Sudafed-ed up, but it's alright because I'm having to do this rather sultry scene, so maybe it's OK that my voice is three octaves lower.","It just proves good movies don't need 100 million dollars to be good.","It's nothing to be ashamed of to have a stutter.","It's always a little mind-boggling to realize that these famous actors know who I am.","I had to learn to dance for 'The Adjustment Bureau' and it was nearly impossible. I turned up with my knees knocking in my leotard and went home and cried my eyes out.","I attempted to fish in Scotland and I managed to hook a dog. It was a horrible moment but the dog turned out to be fine.","Marriage is something that needs to be worked on every day. I don't know if I'm the one to give marital advice since I've only been married for a little over a year, but marriage is certainly easier if you are open, trusting and loving.","I think it is nice for people to appreciate a slow-burning, beautiful story that makes you feel good when it is over.","I'm kind of effectively bipolar.","The business is all about gush and hype. You never have a bad meeting in L.A.","After this interview, I'm going to immigration to try to sort out my Green Card, just like any other normal person.","When you're in love, you're so happy that you want to tell people about it. But now I have to censor myself. You need to protect the happiness you have.","If you're in America a lot, it's easy to get into playing American. All of it, the sounds, the energies, all very different. But it's really hard to do the accent. I tend to try and stay in it all day, which is the only way I can manage it.","Americans are a lot more open, of course. There's something more declamatory in the way you express emotions. It's a stereotype but it's true. British people can appear repressed in expressing emotions. Not very good at self-evaluating, or affirming situations, touching, anything like that.","If you can capture the humanity of a family struggling in an economic crisis you can make a difference. You can raise awareness just of the simple humanity.","A lot of period dramas can appear quite arch to most people, stuffy.","I'm a big supporter of Joe Johnston and I think that 'Captain America' is going to be really fun and I gather that the story is really interesting. It just wasn't what I wanted to do next, to be honest.","I think for me the job always has to be the right thing at the right time.","So I don't really have much rivalry, or if there is any, I don't really know anything about it. Because, you know, I'm not around girls like that. The friends I have in the business, I'm always really happy for them. I think we're always happy for each other. That sounds crap, but it's true.","Give us a break! I've hardly done anything but independent films.","Why should you have to atone for making big movies?","Watch the History Channel if you want it literal and historically perfect.","I had a non-existent knowledge of Queen Victoria's early years. Like everyone else, I thought of her as an old lady dressed in black. My mom had told me about her, though, that she had a very loving relationship with Albert, that they had lots of kids, and that he died young.","Personally, I'm an advocate for short engagements. Long sometimes means there is a reason for it. Two years engaged and no wedding... I'd be upset.","People just want to know something, anything. It's all the stuff you never want to talk about, the private stuff.","I find it quite hard to sum up my relationship in a sound bite. I feel that it trivializes it for other people's pleasure. It's an adventure.","I do strive to find projects that are trying to carve out some new space. I enjoy projects that leap away from the crowd a little bit.","It's quite hard to faze me. I'm fairly un-shockable.","I'm about to do my second Bikram yoga class in Anchorage, Alaska. It's the only way to stay warm. I've got to get into shape. I've been eating nothing but fish and chips.","I'm such a diva on set.","I've got guns now. It's kind of gross.","I'm on a health kick! I'm drawn to cheeseburgers, so I've got to just try and keep it on an even keel.","I don't really watch that much TV, to be honest.","I almost broke my coccyx on 'The Wolf Man', and I banged my head once. I had to fall really hard.","I would love to be on Broadway!","I think I'm drawn to characters with complexity or who are under duress in some way and have some conflict going on.","If you're very open to watching the world go by, with people's different tics, you absorb it all without realizing it and find ways to put something into your character. I'm not sure I'm always aware I'm mimicking someone.","I can understand there are things like shadows they need to fix after a shoot, but it's unfair to represent an image of yourself if it's not true. They're gonna see what you look like on film anyway, so why try to cover all your wobbly bits in a photo?","It's a big chip on my shoulder that I have not been to any of his parties - P. Diddy, Diddy Puff. But he was super nice to me. And he does look sharp, that guy. Doesn't ever go wrong with a suit."],"Emily Bronte":["I have dreamed in my life, dreams that have stayed with me ever after, and changed my ideas; they have gone through and through me, like wine through water, and altered the color of my mind.","Love is like the wild rose-briar; Friendship like the holly-tree. The holly is dark when the rose-briar blooms, but which will bloom most constantly?","I'll walk where my own nature would be leading: It vexes me to choose another guide.","I see heaven's glories shine and faith shines equal.","Any relic of the dead is precious, if they were valued living.","Having leveled my palace, don't erect a hovel and complacently admire your own charity in giving me that for a home.","Whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same.","A good heart will help you to a bonny face, my lad and a bad one will turn the bonniest into something worse than ugly.","A person who has not done one half his day's work by ten o clock, runs a chance of leaving the other half undone.","I am now quite cured of seeking pleasure in society, be it country or town. A sensible man ought to find sufficient company in himself.","The tyrant grinds down his slaves and they don't turn against him, they crush those beneath them.","Honest people don't hide their deeds.","Proud people breed sad sorrows for themselves.","I cannot express it: but surely you and everybody have a notion that there is, or should be, an existence of yours beyond you.","Terror made me cruel."],"Emily Browning":["For me, I see filmmaking as art.","With my boyfriend, we can make sexist jokes to each other because we know it's absolutely not true. If I get home from a long day and he says: 'Go on, get in the kitchen,' it's funny because we know it's not our lives.","I've actually got turned down for a lot of roles because I'm not bubbly enough. People have told me to be more 'up', but I can't, really. I find it hard to be smiley and giggly all the time.","With young people, there's often that carelessness, allowing yourself to get into danger - recklessness, I suppose.","I was lucky - the first eight productions I auditioned for, I got cast.","I need to push myself. I'm not saying that I just want to do anything that's shocking, but when you have that combination of a script that's really beautiful and extremely shocking, it's exciting for me.","I tend to over-analyse things. I'm not the type of person to flip a coin and let things happen.","I'm a massive daydreamer. I'm constantly lost within my own fantasies and my own thoughts personally, and I think maybe that is sort of represented in what we do for a living, the fact that we make believe everything and we escape into these other characters for a living.","In my everyday life I'm a little bit nervous and not particularly brave. I feel like if I can be completely brave in my work then I'm doing something right.","I know a lot of parents of kid actors I've worked with have pressured them into acting, but my parents are different. I'm really lucky to have them because they let me make my own decisions.","After Hollywood, you know if people are interested in you or in the fact that you've been in a movie. You know who your real friends are.","I'd rather make an interesting film that gets people talking, that maybe some people hate, than make the kind of 'entertaining' film that everyone feels ambivalent about.","I can cry at the drop of a hat. I've always found that easier than laughing in films.","I have to just worry about my own opinion and the opinions of the people I'm working with and people who are close to me.","Being from Australia, I've never even touched a gun. It's so not a part of our culture.","I usually hate going around and doing press. It sort of stresses me out.","I'm into video games, but only real specific lame video games.","The thing is, I actually feel a lot more comfortable at school just bumming around with my friends than I do at Hollywood parties. But then, I guess you're just never happy with what you have.","For me it would be unhealthy to be a method actor; I'm not mentally stable enough for that - I need to separate my two worlds.","When you act, you really have to give all of yourself, and if you're doing that purely for money, it's not healthy.","I prefer to make a film that people have a really intense reaction to than have a film that people feel ambivalent about.","If people love what I do, that's fantastic. And there's always going to be people who don't, and if I focus on that, then it'll destroy me. I have to just worry about my own opinion and the opinions of the people I'm working with and people who are close to me. Otherwise, it'll drive me crazy.","What we're supposed to do as actors is be able to portray real human beings and emotions. And if you grow up in this bubble of showbiz and you only know people who make movies, you don't really have an understanding of the world outside.","'Sailor Moon' was my favorite cartoon of all time, and I'm still kind of obsessed with it. I own all the DVDs to watch it at home.","The only problem I have with American money is that it's all kind of the same color, so I'm always having to look. Whereas with Australian money, you have purple, blue, yellow... We keep it nice and simple.","I've been acting since I was a kid, so I just feel confident in the fact that I can do it to some degree. I've never thought I was amazing; I've just thought, 'I know this, I can do it.'","What we do to ourselves to look a certain way is crazy.","A strange thing happens to me that I'm sure happens to a lot of actors when the camera starts rolling. I'm not 'me' any more.","There have been a few times when I've read a script and it's really cool but the girl character's just kind of pathetic. It's not going to do me any favours just being 'the girl' in a cool movie.","It is frustrating when in an interview people say: 'Give us your make-up tips' and 'How do you stay skinny?' I think: 'Do you ask a guy that?'","I'm a very private person. I find it very daunting to have to give private parts of myself away to people, you know?","Often, people who want to make interesting films simply don't have the money to do it."],"Emily Calandrelli":["Because of technologies from space exploration, we can begin to understand our world's origins, and our lives are improving. These are the reasons why dedicating a life to the sciences and space exploration is so meaningful and rewarding.","Representation is so important because it's hard for kids to want to be what they can't see. Little girls and boys need to know that it's natural for girls to love science and tech.","Planet Earth is far more resilient than humans and will certainly outlive us.","Because of engineering, I have been able to experience things I never thought I would be able to do as an undergraduate.","I've always been in love with the stars and view the cosmos as the ultimate adventure.","Girls need to see somebody that looks like them talking about science and technology.","Being interested in science and engineering is not a male quality.","The West Virginia NASA Space Grant took me under their wing and taught me everything about applying for internships, scholarships, and performing research at the undergraduate level.","Sometimes, when you are one of only a couple of girls in an engineering class, you feel like you are representing women in general. That is a large burden to bear.","One big part of Movember is raising awareness for men's health. A lot of people gotten involved found out members of their extended families had had prostate cancer.","Cutting NASA education funds would most severely affect students from low- to middle-income families and students from non-Ivy League-level schools.","I tell students that I believe STEM majors have the most exciting opportunities than any other majors in college.","I want to make everyone believe that they can understand math and science.","I wish that I was one of those kids who grew up saying I always wanted to be an astronaut and was really good at science and math. But that wasn't really the case. I always liked it, but I never believed I was one of the smart kids.","In high school, I didn't realize that science or engineering were male-dominated fields. When I got to college, and I was one of two girls in a 50-person class, that's when I realized that this was a unique decision I had made as a girl to go into engineering.","I did two master's degrees - aeronautics and astronautics, and the second one was technology and policy. That taught me how to think about issues in science and technology as they relate to the general public.","When I got to college, I discovered how many incredible opportunities NASA offered students pursuing a career in the space industry.","When I got to MIT, I discovered a really interesting Master's program called the Science and Technology and Policy Program - it taught people with a background in STEM how to think about science and tech from a policy perspective. It was a great way to understand how to communicate science to a policymaker or a layperson.","'The Daily Show' took a topic - politics - which many people considered to be boring, confusing, or even annoying to learn about, and found a way to make it interesting, digestible, and fun. I believe 'Bill Nye Saves the World' can do the same for science.","Nobody likes feeling like an outsider, so it's intimidating for young girls to give STEM a try when they look into STEM clubs/classes and see a room full of boys.","In the grand scheme of things, polar bears are the least of our problems when it comes to climate change.","It's impossible to put a video online without hoards of anonymous men picking apart your appearance or saying especially cruel things. It works to silence women who shouldn't be scared of sharing their opinions with others.","I am very inspired by the exploration of space via private means."],"Emily Carr":["It is wonderful to feel the grandness of Canada in the raw.","Oh, Spring! I want to go out and feel you and get inspiration. My old things seem dead. I want fresh contacts, more vital searching.","There is something bigger than fact: the underlying spirit, all it stands for, the mood, the vastness, the wildness.","I sat staring, staring, staring - half lost, learning a new language or rather the same language in a different dialect. So still were the big woods where I sat, sound might not yet have been born.","You come into the world alone and you go out of the world alone yet it seems to me you are more alone while living than even going and coming.","You always feel when you look it straight in the eye that you could have put more into it, could have let yourself go and dug harder.","Perfectly ordered disorder designed with a helter-skelter magnificence.","Trees love to toss and sway; they make such happy noises.","I think that one's art is a growth inside one. I do not think one can explain growth. It is silent and subtle. One does not keep digging up a plant to see how it grows.","You must be absolutely honest and true in the depicting of a totem for meaning is attached to every line. You must be most particular about detail and proportion.","Be careful that you do not write or paint anything that is not your own, that you don't know in your own soul.","The artist himself may not think he is religious, but if he is sincere his sincerity in itself is religion.","The men resent a woman getting any honour in what they consider is essentially their field. Men painters mostly despise women painters. So I have decided to stop squirming, to throw any honour in with Canada and women.","You will have to experiment and try things out for yourself and you will not be sure of what you are doing. That's all right, you are feeling your way into the thing.","Twenty can't be expected to tolerate sixty in all things, and sixty gets bored stiff with twenty's eternal love affairs."],"Emily Chang":["Great companies are built in the office, with hard work put in by a team.","If you want to do this job, you have to really want it because it's hard. It's a long road to get here. I moved all over the world, but it's worth it. I love what I do.","The basketball great Kobe Bryant started his own venture-capital firm. LeBron James has rebranded himself as not just an athlete but also an investor and entrepreneur.","In college, I got an internship at my local station in Honolulu one summer, and I just fell in love with broadcast news, reporting, and storytelling. After college, I started out at NBC, and I worked behind the scenes at 'Today' and 'Dateline.'","I love what I do. I love getting to talk with these people, and I feel like I'm learning something every day. You also have to be a really good listener, which I think is an underestimated skill.","When you're in the middle of an interview, it's so easy to stop listening and think about the next question you're going to ask. You can miss that golden moment which might take you in a different direction or a direction you didn't expect.","It's not easy, but I truly that think being a good listener is an important part of being a good journalist.","Managing directors at top-tier investment banks may pocket a million a year and be worth tens of millions after a long career. Early employees at tech firms like Uber, Airbnb, and Snapchat can make many times that amount of money in a matter of years.","There is an often-told story that Silicon Valley is filled with women looking to cash in by marrying wealthy tech moguls. Whether there really is a significant number of such women is debatable.","Every time I sit down with a powerful working mom, I wrestle with whether to ask the 'mom question.' I don't want to be part of perpetuating a double standard by asking women in business a question that men are not asked.","When I first met YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki, I was moderating a panel she was on for Harvard alums. We were both wrapping up our maternity leaves. She had just had her fifth child; I'd just had my second. We traded tips on maternity clothes, and I peppered her with questions about how she finds her balance.","At the 'Vanity Fair' New Establishment Summit, I asked Alibaba CEO Mike Evans - who has nine kids! - how he does it, as well as Didi President Jean Liu, a mother of three. Evans said he couldn't do work well without the support of his family and vice versa.","Vinod Khosla is best known for shunning convention and taking massive risks on companies he calls 'black swans' -companies with a near-complete chance of failure. But, if they succeed, the world will be forever changed.","Padmasree Warrior has been on all the lists. The most powerful women in tech. The most powerful women in the world.","In December 2014, Uber held its annual holiday party on an unfurnished floor at its swank, mood-lit headquarters in San Francisco. Employees and investors attended in flamboyant attire from the Roaring '20s and drank at an open bar into the early morning hours.","Like Hollywood, Washington, and New York City, Silicon Valley is in a moral crisis after a litany of revelations about predatory behavior by powerful men.","Venture capitalists Justin Caldbeck of Binary Capital, Steve Jurvetson of DFJ, and Dave McClure of 500 Startups all left their firms following accusations of misconduct.","Pishevar, co-founder and managing director of Sherpa Capital, is a powerful figure in the Valley and a bridge to establishment figures on both coasts. He cultivated a relationship with Uber co-founder Travis Kalanick and publicly came to his defense when he was ousted as chief executive officer and sued by another investor.","I still ask myself the same questions every woman asks. Was it my fault? Did I say or do something to make him feel like such an advance was welcome? And like most women, I never told anyone. Instead, I just quit.","The #metoo campaign picked up speed after the actress Alyssa Milano suggested that if every woman simply typed 'me too' on their platform of choice, they might give the world a true sense of the magnitude of the problem. The hope is that safety in numbers might minimize the shame many women feel in admitting that this has happened to them.","The #metoo campaign opened a particular window into the gender dynamics in technology, with many prominent women speaking out.","Will #metoo translate into #webelieveyou? #Wecanonlyhope."],"Emily Deschanel":["Everything I know about makeup, I've learned from my sister.","I really like being pregnant. Not that there aren't things I don't love, but when I think about what my body is doing - creating a child - it just blows my mind. I'm in awe of the process and science.","I'm definitely a people person. I love socializing and being around people and having a good conversation.","It makes a big difference to recycle. It makes a big difference to use recycled products. It makes a big difference to reuse things, to not use the paper cup - and each time you do, that's a victory.","I'm a vegan, but you can be really unhealthy as a vegan, too.","I was a hostess in a restaurant in New York when I was 21, and I was too good of an employee. I was putting most of my energy into that instead of acting. But my father told my sister and me to look at whatever needed to be done and do that job well, no matter what it was.","The United Nations did a study just over two years ago, and that blew my mind. I started thinking that if people are vegetarian for one day a week, that makes a huge difference!","I've been a vegan for about 15 years.","I have a treadmill, and I work out with my trainer, Julie Diamond, as often as possible. She's so positive.","For me, it always has to be about health. That's why I'm a vegan. Well, I don't even do that for my health entirely, I do it for animals.","I've been vegan for 15 years, and it turns out it makes a very big impact on the environment to eat fewer animal products, which cause more greenhouse gases than all of transportation combined.","I think it's important to remember that to exercise you don't have to run a sprint.","My whole family is very sarcastic and constantly making jokes.","The real challenge for a vegan is getting vitamin B and omega-3s, but you can get those in a vegetarian supplement.","My mom breastfed me for more than a year, and I can't imagine doing it any other way. It's cheap and much better for the environment, and you don't have to lug all that stuff around."],"Emily Dickinson":["Morning without you is a dwindled dawn.","Saying nothing... sometimes says the most.","Behavior is what a man does, not what he thinks, feels, or believes.","I dwell in possibility.","Unable are the loved to die, for love is immortality.","The soul should always stand ajar, ready to welcome the ecstatic experience.","Hope is the thing with feathers that perches in the soul - and sings the tunes without the words - and never stops at all.","Dogs are better than human beings because they know but do not tell.","If I can stop one heart from breaking, I shall not live in vain.","Luck is not chance, it's toil; fortune's expensive smile is earned.","A wounded deer leaps the highest.","Truth is so rare that it is delightful to tell it.","That it will never come again is what makes life sweet.","Fortune befriends the bold.","Find ecstasy in life; the mere sense of living is joy enough.","Not knowing when the dawn will come I open every door.","To make a prairie it takes a clover and one bee, One clover, and a bee, And revery. The revery alone will do, If bees are few.","If fame belonged to me, I could not escape her; if she did not, the longest day would pass me on the chase, and the approbation of my dog would forsake me then. My barefoot rank is better.","Old age comes on suddenly, and not gradually as is thought.","A word is dead when it is said, some say. I say it just begins to live that day.","My friends are my estate.","Whenever a thing is done for the first time, it releases a little demon.","Because I could not stop for death, He kindly stopped for me; The carriage held but just ourselves and immortality.","In such a porcelain life, one likes to be sure that all is well lest one stumble upon one's hopes in a pile of broken crockery.","Forever is composed of nows.","I hope you love birds too. It is economical. It saves going to heaven.","Love is anterior to life, posterior to death, initial of creation, and the exponent of breath.","The brain is wider than the sky.","They might not need me; but they might. I'll let my head be just in sight; a smile as small as mine might be precisely their necessity.","People need hard times and oppression to develop psychic muscles.","Parting is all we know of heaven, and all we need of hell.","I'm nobody, who are you?","How strange that nature does not knock, and yet does not intrude!","It is better to be the hammer than the anvil.","I have a brother and sister; my mother does not care for thought, and father, too busy with his briefs to notice what we do. He buys me many books, but begs me not to read them, because he fears they joggle the mind.","We were never intimate mother and children while she was our mother - but... when she became our child, the affection came.","I never had a mother. I suppose a mother is one to whom you hurry when you are troubled.","Nature is our eldest mother; she will do no harm.","He ate and drank the precious Words, his Spirit grew robust; He knew no more that he was poor, nor that his frame was Dust.","I argue thee that love is life. And life hath immortality.","Where thou art, that is home.","Finite to fail, but infinite to venture.","Success is counted sweetest by those who never succeed.","After great pain, a formal feeling comes. The Nerves sit ceremonious, like tombs.","There is no Frigate like a book to take us lands away nor any coursers like a page of prancing Poetry.","Fame is a fickle food upon a shifting plate.","If I read a book and it makes my whole body so cold no fire can ever warm me, I know that is poetry.","To love is so startling it leaves little time for anything else.","Dying is a wild night and a new road.","They say that God is everywhere, and yet we always think of Him as somewhat of a recluse.","Beauty is not caused. It is.","To live is so startling it leaves little time for anything else.","Tell the truth, but tell it slant.","I am growing handsome very fast indeed! I expect I shall be the belle of Amherst when I reach my 17th year. I don't doubt that I shall have perfect crowds of admirers at that age. Then how I shall delight to make them await my bidding, and with what delight shall I witness their suspense while I make my final decision.","I had no portrait, now, but am small, like the wren; and my hair is bold, like the chestnut bur; and my eyes, like the sherry in the glass, that the guest leaves.","I do not like the man who squanders life for fame; give me the man who living makes a name.","If I feel physically as if the top of my head were taken off, I know that is poetry.","God is not so wary as we, else He would give us no friends, lest we forget Him! The charms of the heaven in the bush are superseded, I fear, by the heaven in the hand, occasionally.","Sisters are brittle things. God was penurious with me, which makes me shrewd with Him. One is a dainty sum! One bird, one cage, one flight; one song in those far woods, as yet suspected by faith only!","Celebrity is the chastisement of merit and the punishment of talent."],"Emily Giffin":["Often I feel that projects overwhelm us when we look at how many hours are involved until completion. But just getting started is usually not that difficult.","Everyone wants to belong, or be a part of something bigger than themselves, but it's important to follow your heart and be true to yourself in the process.","Life is about the gray areas. Things are seldom black and white, even when we wish they were and think they should be, and I like exploring this nuanced terrain.","I like to match what I wear to my book jacket - it's a little bit cheesy, but it's my thing.","A theme in a lot of my books - and in my own life - is making choices that you feel you should make, or what society wants you to make, as opposed to what is truly right for you.","I've always been intrigued by the power of secrets. When is it justifiable to keep them from the ones we love? And does keeping them irrevocably change who we are?","It's a funny thing - when I'm crazed with work, spending time with my children relaxes me. Yet, at the end of a long weekend with them, the very thing I need to relax is a little work and time away from them!","Inevitably I draw on my own relationships when I write, so if I'm writing about a fight between a husband and his wife, of course I'm going to think about a recent fight with my husband. Or if I'm writing about sisters, of course I'm going to think about my sister.","Well, shoes, bags and clutches are usually my big weaknesses - my husband always laughs when I call them 'investment pieces.'","I try to write about real women, real people - in other words flawed characters.","I try to recognize that there is no such thing as having it all - and it's impossible to be perfect. You just have to let certain things go.","I have always been drawn to coming-of-age stories and books and movies featuring compelling young characters.","I really try to focus on my books and readers.","For true downtime, I enjoy going for light runs, having drinks with friends and going to the movies with my husband.","I think it's important to try to be present with whatever it is you're doing. And if you can't be present, take a break.","Guilt is a supreme waste of time and energy.","Writing a teen character is something I wanted to try again for a long time!","I don't really know why I went to law school."],"Emily Greene Balch":["Technology gives us the facilities that lessen the barriers of time and distance - the telegraph and cable, the telephone, radio, and the rest.","The future will be determined in part by happenings that it is impossible to foresee; it will also be influenced by trends that are now existent and observable.","We have lived through the flood time of fascism and of the nazism which ran its meteoric course at a cost to mankind in suffering and waste beyond all computation.","Industrialization based on machinery, already referred to as a characteristic of our age, is but one aspect of the revolution that is being wrought by technology.","These wars appear also to have given its death blow to colonialism and to imperialism in its colonial form, under which weaker peoples were treated as possessions to be economically exploited. At least we hope that such colonialism is on the way out.","As to judging our own time, and thereby gaining some basis for a judgment of future possibilities, we are doubtless not only too close to it to appraise it but too much formed by it and enclosed within it to do so.","There is a great interest in comparative religion and a desire to understand faiths other than our own and even to experiment with exotic cults.","The question whether the long effort to put an end to war can succeed without another major convulsion challenges not only our minds but our sense of responsibility.","Probably people always feel that they are living in a time of transition, but we can hardly be mistaken perhaps in thinking that this is an era of particularly momentous change, rapid and proceeding at an ever quickening rate.","It is natural to try to understand one's own time and to seek to analyse the forces that move it.","A dark and terrible side of this sense of community of interests is the fear of a horrible common destiny which in these days of atomic weapons darkens men's minds all around the globe.","A third ideal that has made its way in the modern world is reliance on reason, especially reason disciplined and enriched by modern science. An eternal basis of human intercommunication is reason.","In listing these tendencies making for a new world, we must not forget developments in the religious or spiritual thinking and feeling of mankind, where also we feel a strong unifying trend.","The First World War, and especially the latest one, largely swept away what was left in Europe of feudalism and of feudal landlords, especially in Poland, Hungary, and the South East generally.","The desire for liberty has also made itself felt as struggle against domestic tyranny or arbitrary rule.","The role of Italy and of Austria has diminished as has that of France and Britain; Germany and Japan have suffered catastrophically.","Without a common loyalty to either a state or a church they have nevertheless a vast deal in common.","A major one which no one can overlook is technological and based on inventions and discoveries which have altered the whole basis of production and deeply affected social relations.","A second characteristic of our time is the prevalence of nationalism. This is still spreading, affecting new communities, more peripheral regions and so-called backward peoples.","Men who are scandalized at the lack of freedom in Russia do not ask themselves how real is liberty among the poor, the weak, and the ignorant in capitalist society.","Those who are rooted in the depths that are eternal and unchangeable and who rely on unshakeable principles, face change full of courage, courage based on faith.","We speculate as to what is in store for us. But we not only undergo events, we in part cause them or at least influence their course. We have not only to study them but to act.","Another cause of change, one less noticeable but fundamental, is the modern growth of population closely connected with scientific and medical discoveries. It is interesting that the United Nations has set up a special Commission to study this question."],"Emily Kinney":["When I was little, we moved around a lot, actually. In second grade, I think I went to three different schools. We were in Nevada and Oregon and as well as a few different places in Nebraska. I did go to high school in the same town.","Acting is so much about waiting... waiting for an audition, waiting for the right part to come along. It's nice to write your own thing, write about what you're feeling and then go out and perform them. It's a nice thing to have and not get bored.","It's definitely one of those things when you decide to be an actor that it would be really cool to be in a Broadway show or a series regular on a hit show.","I would rather do a project that I've invested so much time to, rather than try to get a part on another show.","Sometimes when you're starting out with acting, you have to take what you can get to get experience and meet people."],"Emily Kuroda":["My mother came from Japan, and I really didn't understand her often. Now that I'm older, I do.","I think by embracing your heritage and your history, it just serves you so much more, and you become a deeper and more powerful person by embracing them.","Seriously, how many times do you see Asian-American characters that have an actual family, feelings? You don't see them love and be sad and have all the human emotions. I think that 'Gilmore Girls' is one of the very, very few where we were offered a chance to explore these characters multidimensionally.","I probably didn't talk in public until eighth grade, and then in high school, I started doing oral interpretation - kind of like monologues. Through theater and plays, I started coming out of my shell.","I was in one of the first sitcoms that had a lot of Asians in it. It was called 'Gung Ho' on ABC.","The thought of me wanting to act was not an option when I was growing up, so I was getting my teaching credential.","When I moved to L.A. and joined East West Players, I started acting professionally.","In grammar school, I didn't talk. Everybody said I was the invisible one. I'm still very shy.","Although I would like the negative balanced with the positive, what really bothers me is if it's not real. You can add humanity to what might look like a negative role."],"Emily Levine":["I was taught to do math and read at the same time. So you're six years old, you're reading 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs' and it becomes rapidly obvious that there are only two kinds of men in the world: dwarves and Prince Charmings. And the odds are seven is to one against your finding the prince. That's why little girls don't do math.","When you're surrounded by people who share the same set of assumptions as you, you start to think that's reality.","I am a recovering narcissist. I thought narcissism was about self-love till someone told me there is a flip side to it. It is actually drearier than self-love; it is unrequited self-love.","Old age is the only thing that lives up to its reputation.","Here's how I see obesity: as a symptom. The larger problem is over-consumption. In a society that identifies consumption with patriotism, valorizes 'growth' above all else and assigns status according to how much you consume, we compete with each other to see who can consume the most.","Objectivity is the subject subjugating the object. That is how you assert yourself. You make yourself the active voice and the object is the passive no-voice."],"Emily Martin":["Clearly, products for women are not as well scrutinized as products for men. It appears they never tested the implants in breast tissue and that they received decades of complaints from women. It's the kind of stuff that makes you want to scream!","Menstruation not only carries with it the connotation of a productive system that has failed to produce; it also carries the idea of production gone awry, making products of no use, not to specification, unsalable, wasted, scrap.","When we anthropomorphize the egg and sperm, when we turn them into a miniature bride and groom complete with personalities, what effect does this have on abortion legislation?","The condition of sleep is profoundly contradictory. It is a precious good... but it is a good like none other, because to obtain it, one must seemingly give up the imperative to have it."],"Emily Meade":["I always have a very complex personal life as far as romance goes. Sometimes I have a little too much time to get into too much trouble... and drama. It's either I'm working, or I have nothing to do but focus on my personal life. It's a little hectic.","You grow up loving movies, and your first instinct is you want to be an actor, because those are the people you see in the movies. But when you actually become an actor, you're like, 'Oh, wait, this is actually only a small portion of the storytelling. If I want to really tell a story, I'd want to be a director.'","I was like little-miss wannabe punk-rocker; I would go home and secretly listen to Pink, and dance around, like, 'Ugh, she understands me so well!'","Most of my good friends are my friends from high school or childhood, and they're not actors - they have 9-to-5 jobs. But I've obviously, over time, developed friendships with actors. It's two completely different worlds.","I don't want fame as far as the tweeting or the image of it. But, the idea of being famous is actually exciting to me, just because then you can have a choice in what you do. I would like to be at a point where I'm not asking for parts anymore, and I'm actually just choosing between a part that I want to do.","I was traumatized by the cartoon version of 'The Hobbit.' It's not supposed to be scary, I don't think, but literally I think that's the most scared I've ever been.","I get a little nauseous and disoriented watching 3D, but as a kid I loved it and I was really into it, so if a movie can be in 3D, then why not?","Sometimes I get really down on myself for not having the exact career I want, but it's ok as long as you know what you want and you're going towards that. Accept it's going to be a different path than you thought in the first place.","The funniest thing is I never understood why actors were so shady about who they're dating. Then I realized the things you say get printed and the people you're involved with read them. That's what's tricky. Nothing goes unnoticed. I don't want to get myself in trouble!","I am very harsh on myself. I can point out a list. My nose is very strange. I have a very round face. I sound so ungrateful. Obviously I'm being hard on myself. Whether it's body dysmorphia, or whatever it is, I can always find something wrong.","I've been crazy lucky that I've never had a day job. I get really close to having no money, then I always wind up getting some kind of great job."],"Emily Mortimer":["Los Angeles is like a beauty parlor at the end of the universe.","I am a good mother and I feel proud about it.","Normal people, who can be good people but do bad things, are very interesting to me, and people that never get a parking ticket or never do a bad thing in their lives can be really dangerous.","I went to dinner with my mother-in-law and I just realized I was talking in sound bites to her and expecting her to laugh every time I said anything or be jotting something down in a notebook. So you have to kind of really have a talk with yourself after you've done a press tour and say, 'Chill out!'","The odd thing is if you asked me to do the accent now I would find it very difficult unless I was also playing that part, because I associate it so much with entering into the role and stepping into someone else's shoes.","I was terribly shy when I was growing up, I really wasn't confident with other people and I think I was always afraid of up or not being this very cool, amazing person that I wanted to be.","So what I do now is to pre-empt that by making the up into a virtue, and telling funny stories about how crap I am before people have a chance to notice it for themselves and think maybe I haven't realised.","But I have to grow out of it, because it's very boring, really. Even when you're telling people how crap you are, you're still banging on about yourself.","I never felt I was quite the ticket academically. I always felt I had to put in an enormous amount of effort not to be disappointing. So I worked really hard, but at the time it suited me, because I didn't do very much else.","I did my homework and didn't go out much, and had a very highly developed kitsch fantasy life where I dreamed of being a dancing girl.","I had friends at school, but I was never part of a gang and I dreamed of that sense of belonging to a group. You know, where people would call me 'Em' and shout across the bar, 'Em, what are you drinking?' after the show.","My dad had this philosophy that if you tell children they're beautiful and wonderful then they believe it, and they will be. So I never thought I was unattractive. But I was never one of the girls at school who had lots of boyfriends.","I think we probably will end up in America because he would be giving up much more to come and live here. If you want to work in film, that's really where you have to be. But I'm not sure that being an ex-pat is very good for one's sense of self.","So far I haven't really been prominent enough to get critical attention focused on me. So, of course, I fully expect bad reviews, but I will be wracked with misery as a result.","51st State was one that I loved doing because the character was so out there, and in a way I was sad to leave the character behind. I'm afraid I could never be that cool in real life!","It's a hard thing to do, to be given a script, and know that you've got to turn up on the first day of the shoot - generally without having had any rehearsal - and present a character. It's really baffling; it's incredibly hard to know how to begin, to approach it, other than just thinking about it.","To get art nowadays, in cinema or books or anything, that grapples with the possibility of a meaningless universe... it just doesn't happen any more. In even the most indie of the indie films, everything has to come to some kind of neat conclusion.","I'm trying to avoid, you know, guilt, even though before the child is born, you're already thinking you're doing things wrong... Why do I think that will probably carry over until the day you die?","Accents are very tangible, blessedly, and if you have to do one, it's a way of getting into character. I can read it through a few times and pretend I know what I'm doing!","I think that you can get more passionate about somebody the longer you're with them and the more you know them and the more you go through together. Being married is definitely better than it's cracked up to be I think.","Doing press is like eating at McDonald's: while it's going on it's vaguely enjoyable - you're seduced by your own vanity and taking yourself rather seriously - but immediately afterwards you feel sick.","I want any excuse to come home. My dad is not a spring chicken any more. If anyone says, 'Go buy a postage stamp in London,' I'll go and do it.","I already feel a bit annoyed at myself for writing screenplays. It's a bit, I don't know, model-singer-dancer-actress that went to a posh school. There's something too weirdly predictable about it.","I want to discover more things about acting.","I've only half-admitted I'm a professional. I know I am, I've paid my dues, but one of the things I could do better when I'm acting is to really be rigorous and to think I know how to do it. To use my brain.","I think half the time I just assume I don't really know what I'm doing - you have to do that to a certain extent, but you don't have to think you're an idiot savant.","I wake up early. At 6:30 A.M., I'm at my most optimistic.","Breakfast is my favorite meal. I cook a big one for everyone - bacon and eggs. I own a lot of eggcups.","When I'm panicked about my love handles, I go to the YMCA and get obsessed with Kid Rock videos as I'm on the running machine.","Some people come alive at night. I'm hopeless by 9 p.m. Coffee and Cadbury buy me an extra half hour. Often I can't get my clothes off I'm so far gone.","I guess secrets are part of the fabric of everybody's lives. I mean everybody's lives, and guilt is part of the fabric of everybody's lives.","It is brilliant going to the theatre and being forced to sit and listen and think about life. It can be almost a near-religious experience.","I must have been a really pretentious little girl.","I was determined not to become an American citizen but I did it for completely cynical reasons: to avoid paying inheritance tax in the U.S.","I'm a dual citizen, as are my husband and children. We have got eight passports between us; we're weighed down by them whenever we go anywhere.","In my first few years as an actor, I took one terrible TV job after another. But even as I laughed off my awful roles and made fun of myself to friends, my work made me cringe - I dreaded anyone's seeing it. I was crushed that I wasn't doing anything I was proud of.","I decided to give acting a serious, committed try, and soon after, I read the script for 'Lovely and Amazing.' The story was beautiful and honest, and the characters struggled with the same insecurities many women - including me - face. I didn't think I had a chance in hell of being in the film, but I knew I had to go for it.","I'd been shy since childhood, constantly full of self-doubt. And as an actor, I'd been so scared of failing that I made my career - and myself - a big joke.","I'm still shy - I'm no good at my children's parent-teacher conferences, and I'm slowly learning how to ask for what I want. But I now know that I have a reserve of courage to draw upon when I really need it. There's nothing that I'm too scared to have a go at.","You are exposing yourself all the time as an actor. There's the risk of being thought of as bad or boring or unattractive.","I'm physically completely mal-coordinated. My best friend used to make me run for the bus just to give herself a quick, cheap laugh because I definitely don't have that sophisticated cool thing down.","It's dangerous talking about yourself too much because you find yourself talking in sound bites.","I like to mix it up, yeah. I don't sort of think, 'Oh, I need to do a comedy, I've done three dramas this year.' I don't think of it like that, but I definitely from project to project I feel like I want to just do something different all of the time and stop, I don't want to bore myself or anyone else.","I'm always drawn to the thing I think I can't possibly do, because I tend to be better when I think I can't possibly do something than I am when I'm pretty sure I can do something.","I'm an optimist by nature, myself, I think.","I'm always sort of anticipating life being difficult, but on a basic level, that's sort of on the surface, on a basic level, I'm optimistic in the sense that I think it's all going to be alright in the end.","New York is great, but I miss L.A. - I feel like there was something exotic about L.A. that I kind of underestimated at the time. It was very unfamiliar to me.","Lots of people there seemed to be in denial, in absolute denial, of death - everybody's pretending that death doesn't happen in L.A.; if you do enough exercise and take enough wheatgrass and have your pill every day, you might not die.","The thing I miss about L.A. is time. I feel like I had much more time there, partly because no one is ever really doing anything.","I borrowed my friend's car the other day in an attempt to persuade my husband that we needed a car and literally this is true, in the first day of borrowing the car, I got three tickets and I rear-ended it.","I'm just happy to be a film where for once I don't have to worry about my hair, because my managers are always complaining about my hair looking depressing in my movies. Which is true. I mean, it's true."],"Emily Murphy":["This is courtship all the world over - the man all tongue; the woman all ears.","It is claimed, but with what truth we cannot say, that there is a well-defined propaganda among the aliens of colour to bring about the degeneration of the white race."],"Emily Osment":["I don't get embarrassed easily, and I do silly things all the time!","Disney Channel is celebrities coated in sugar. Everything is really happy; everything is really bright.","Balancing school, acting, and a social life can be difficult.","I'm not so great at keeping secrets; maybe that's why no one ever tells me things.","I love Audrey Hepburn. I thought she was very classy.","Actors pull from their own experiences to bring reality to the characters. I wouldn't want to play someone who's a lot like me. There would be no turning it on or off.","I love to play the guitar. I also love photography and fashion.","Everyone needs to be able to have their own space in which to be themselves."],"Emily Oster":["The key to good decision making is evaluating the available information - the data - and combining it with your own estimates of pluses and minuses. As an economist, I do this every day.","All's fair in love and purchasing.","The greatest moments are those when you see the result pop up in a graph or in your statistics analysis - that moment you realise you know something no one else does and you get the pleasure of thinking about how to tell them.","Being pregnant was a lot like being a child again. There was always someone telling you what to do.","No one likes doing chores. In happiness surveys, housework is ranked down there with commuting as activities that people enjoy the least. Maybe that's why figuring out who does which chores usually prompts, at best, tense discussion in a household and, at worst, outright fighting.","I think women - relative to men - tend to feel that they have to do the household chores on top of everything else. This becomes even worse once you have kids. It's enough to have a full time job; a full time job plus a family is even more.","If everyone is good at something different, assigning chores is easy. If your partner is great at grocery shopping and you are great at the laundry, you're set. But this isn't always - or even usually - the case.","The basic idea that incentives can be used to motivate behavior is a powerful one. It works for employees, and it has a clear place in parenting, as anyone who has tried to potty-train a recalcitrant toddler with sticker rewards knows.","Economists typically think that your happiness goes up as you get more money, but the more you have, the less each additional dollar matters. This means that you value money most in times when you have less income and more expenses.","I am extremely devoted to Amazon Prime - which offers speedier free deliveries, free movie streaming and other benefits for an annual fee - but I don't think it is great for groceries.","How much is an hour of your time worth? It's worth whatever wage you would get if you spent that hour working. If you work for an hourly rate, this is an easy calculation. Even if you work for a salary and a fixed number of hours, the principle is the same: It's whatever your salary works out to per hour.","Lovingly crafted and super-creative cupcakes are not exactly on tap in my household after a full day at work, and I do not blame my mother for a second that they were not on tap in hers, either.","Young women who live in areas with high maternal mortality change their behavior less in response to HIV than young women who live in areas with low maternal mortality.","The value of having numbers - data - is that they aren't subject to someone else's interpretation. They are just the numbers. You can decide what they mean for you.","Economics works great for planning your life when you don't have a work passion, since we tend to assume that your job delivers only money and you trade off job hours with leisure hours. If you think your job will just be a job, pick one that pays well per hour and leaves you some time off, even if the activity of the job is boring.","Almost every woman I have spoken to about pregnancy has a story about her doctor giving her a hard time about her weight. Later in my pregnancy it felt like all of my time with my doctor was focused on how fat I was getting - so fat!","The main concern with a very large baby is difficulty in delivery.","Nausea is a normal but unpleasant effect of pregnancy and a really good sign that it is going well. Women who experience nausea in early pregnancy are less likely to miscarry.","I think we've moved to thinking of parenting and pregnancy as something in which you should lose yourself.","To put it mildly, I'm not crazy about the implication that pregnant women are incapable of deciding for themselves.","Because economics is all about optimising, doing the best you can with what you have - it's usually the first place you should look for answers if you want to maximise your happiness.","I travel a fair amount, read on the plane, and I read fast.","I had always been told that you shouldn't clean the litter box when you're pregnant, because of your cat. And I think that is overblown - unless you have, like, three kittens in your house that are living outside and eating raw meat, this shouldn't really be a significant source of concern.","For many women - myself included - pregnancy brings on tremendous anxiety and confusion, along with the joy.","Much of what I do in my job is think about whether relationships we see in data are causal, as opposed to just reflecting correlations. It's exactly these issues which come up in evaluating studies in public health.","Even if you are planning a birth with an epidural, the evidence suggests that a doula can help make things go much more smoothly.","There is some risk to increase birth defects if you do a lot of outdoor gardening when you are pregnant. That can increase rates of toxoplasmosis.","I think that there's a real sense in which pregnancy should be something that you do with your doctor, but I think that for a lot of women the time you have with your doctors is limited and it can be difficult to get all of the answers to your questions.","If you have a traditional view of economics, you're probably thinking of Ben Bernanke making Fed policy, or the guys creating financial derivatives at Goldman Sachs.","The claim that SpongeBob makes your child dumber is a causal claim. If you do X, Y will happen. To prove that, you'd have to show that if you forced the children in the no-TV households to watch SpongeBob and changed nothing else about their lives, they would do worse in school.","I've always loved doing research. I remember doing a research project on the Babylonian numeral system in the eighth grade and thinking, 'This is pretty awesome - is this really a job you can have?' This led me toward a career as an academic, although it took me until college to realise that economics was the right field.","My first summer in college I worked in a fruit fly lab where I had two jobs: dissect the fruit fly larvae brains and incinerate the old tubes of flies.","You work hard for your income, and that hard work is what fuels the economy.","As people do a task, they improve at it.","Economists actually disagree about whether there are significant economic returns from attending an elite college versus a less-selective one.","Good household decision-making often relies on thinking about your household like a firm.","Prenatal testing is a complicated decision for many women, forcing us to confront concerns about a disabled child and risks of miscarriage.","Talking to women about birth can be polarizing.","The biggest food-related risk in pregnancy is listeria. It's a dangerous bacteria, to which pregnant women are especially susceptible, that can lead to miscarriage or stillbirth.","If you asked me which gives me more joy, my work or my family, there is no question that it's my family. Hands down. If I had to give one up, it wouldn't even be a contest.","The enjoyment of work - to the extent that you have any - is likely highest in the first hours of the day when you are fresh, not tired, working on the most important things.","In short, humans are programmed to get bored.","I tell my micro students everything I teach them is important, but the truth is that some things are more useful than others, and opportunity cost is near the top.","Every time you have a carrot instead of a cookie, every time you go to the gym instead of going to the movies, that's a costly investment in your health. But how much you want to invest is going to depend on how much longer you expect to live in the future, even if you don't make those investments.","Even though it is the case that poverty is linked to AIDS, in the sense that Africa is poor and they have a lot of AIDS, it's not necessarily the case that improving poverty - at least in the short run, that improving exports and improving development - it's not necessarily the case that that's going to lead to a decline in HIV prevalence.","Feminists of my mother's generation argued that both mom and dad should work a little less and each do some of the household chores. My parents, for example, split everything 50/50. Even though my father is a terrible cook, he still made dinner exactly half the time.","When I meet people on airplanes and they find out I'm an economist, they usually ask about stock tips.","Adhering to budgeting rules shouldn't trump good decision-making.","One of the big take-aways from a lot of economic theory is that people should engage in consumption smoothing."],"Emily Perkins":["I'd love to do comedy. And I think I have pretty good sense of comic timing, so I'd really like to try that.","One of my favourite actresses is Kate Winslet. She plays strong female characters and seems like she has a strong political awareness. I really like Naomi Watts and Juliette Lewis.","I'm a big fan of 'Woody Allen' movies, so I like all the actresses in his movies like 'Diane Keaton' and Mia Farrow.","My fans have been so great. I'll go on fansites and read messages they put, and they all seem like really nice people.","I have a huge passion for literature.","I love contemporary North American fiction and short fiction. My favorite writer is Jonathan Franzen, and my favorite writers of short fiction are George Saunders and Alice Munro."],"Emily Post":["Manners are a sensitive awareness of the feelings of others. If you have that awareness, you have good manners, no matter what fork you use.","Nothing is less important than which fork you use. Etiquette is the science of living. It embraces everything. It is ethics. It is honor.","To do exactly as your neighbors do is the only sensible rule.","Ideal conversation must be an exchange of thought, and not, as many of those who worry most about their shortcomings believe, an eloquent exhibition of wit or oratory.","To the old saying that man built the house but woman made of it a 'home' might be added the modern supplement that woman accepted cooking as a chore but man has made of it a recreation."],"Emily Procter":["I squirrel away sealed greeting cards that people give me so I can open them later when I'm having a bad day.","180 episodes of 'CSI: Miami' and never the same lipstick twice!","If you live in a small space, you should do the things that make it feel luxurious.","It's not a bad idea to be single, so I can concentrate on my job.","It's funny, because I did all of these interviews as soon as I had the baby, and they were asking questions, and I really didn't have an idea of anything, because I was so blurry.","It's amazing what sleep does for your looks.","I never wear pants in my life. I never thought I'd say this, but I miss wearing pants. For the first time in my life, I miss my pants.","I'm never going to be a modern gal. I love colonial. I love early American. I love a big rectangular piece of brown furniture on a hardwood floor.","What I know from my friends who are cops is they keep their houses very clean, because they say you never know if you're coming back or not.","It's a very weird thing. When you see your house naked, you feel very protective of it and of the people who lived here before.","It's so nice after 10 years as a blond actress in Hollywood to have people let you do smart things.","We weren't allowed to watch TV as kids.","I'm very self-conscious having my picture taken, so I clown around. My driver's license photo looks like a blonde Elvis.","To say that I am organized is an understatement, but my car tells a different story.","I don't email.","I feel like 'CSI: Miami' was just a license to do all sorts of horrible things that I'd always wanted to do.","I felt like the news business was a little rough for me and a little sleazy. So I glided right over into acting.","I've found that I've settled into myself a little bit more in last year and started wearing things that I feel comfortable with and my own style and... I decided to just embrace the person that I am and the look I like, and what I think is pretty.","My house is very serious. It's a lot of antiques, and the way I decided to liven it up is, I paired it very vibrant colors and - bugs... I think that they're pretty. And I think that they're fascinating and they're natural.","I decided about a year ago, and I just feel like I want to see more personal style in people, and I feel like if I'm going to be out there in the public eye, they should see who I am and how I dress, and I feel like it, also.","I think that we could be more careful about what we're saying to young women in terms of their expectations. It's unrealistic to expect people to always be in designer clothes. Girls growing up deserve more freedom in how they look and how they feel about how they look.","There are actually times when there are crimes out there in the world and I find myself trying to figure it out and I ask myself, what am I doing?","I am hoping this is my year to have children. I understand that I am possibly more European in my views of marriage. I am not going to say I'm not going to get married, but it's not my priority.","Before you're a mom you don't know what gear is going to be relevant.","Having a crying baby is inspiration to get the job done quickly.","It's a reality that in this business there's an expectation of being thin. But having a baby is a reality too, and it's more important for me to make milk than to fit into those tiny pants. So that's just going to have to wait.","I've always known I was adopted.","As comfortable as I was with my adoption, the nature-versus-nurture question has been a big one for me. I adore my parents, but I always wondered if I would feel a different kind of love-not more or less, just different-for someone who was biologically related.","I couldn't wait to look at someone who shared my genes. I thought my baby was going to provide a decoder key to my past. But then I looked at Pippa and realized, no, she's actually the key to my future.","Getting pregnant wasn't easy, and I found that devastating. I really beat myself up for waiting so long when I'd always wanted children and family had been the basis of my happiness my whole life.","Your child's not looking at you and going, 'Mmm, I love a clavicle. Let me nestle into that.'","I'm going to let myself off the hook, because if there's one thing that is not my focus at the moment, it's how much I weigh.","I started crying the other day just thinking that the baby is going to leave me soon! You have this relationship with this person in your belly and it's really amazing.","It's really fun at night, because I can see the baby kicking. I can feel the knee or the foot. The baby is starting to get heavy, and it's a really incredible feeling. I'm so grateful I get to experience this.","I would love to tell you that I don't worry about losing the weight after the baby is born, but I do try to think before I eat. The first cookie? Definitely! But I try to think about if I really want to do the extra sit-ups before I eat the second one.","I always felt my emancipation into truly being a grown-up was when I had to figure out how to fold up a king-size fitted bottom sheet on my own.","In college, I was a weather anchor for the local news. I would 'borrow' my forecast from The Weather Channel.","I always wear high heels.","When I was 8, my favorite toy was a stapler. My brother was afraid of me."],"Emily Ratajkowski":["I always say, 'Do you have a body? Then you're swimsuit ready.' That's all you need to worry about.","Your body is your body; it's natural. Learn to love yourself for it.","I basically stay in jewelry all the time. I have the same couple of necklaces, earrings, and rings, and they usually don't come off my body.","Nudity isn't something people should take offense to.","If you don't feel good in the bathing suit, you're not going to look good.","I have great childhood memories cow-tipping, going off and getting lost in the bog for hours, and coming home covered in dirt.","Your bikini should compliment your dress, and they should work together to frame your body. It's just like layering a T-shirt under a blazer. Just keep your proportions in mind.","I actually don't wear fragrance. I always feel like I smell cheap. I guess I just haven't found one that's not overpowering or too sweet. Even when I try one of the super masculine scents, I just think, 'I don't want to smell like a man.' Besides, I like my own scent.","I remember the first time I pulled out of my driveway in my grandparents' Nissan Ultimate or Centra. I just remember getting in a car that smells like my grandparents, with both my parents standing on the lawn, so petrified. That was my car up until I was 18.","A selfie is a sort of interesting way to reclaim the gaze, right? You're looking at yourself and taking a photo while looking at everyone. But also, who cares?","To me, 'sexy' is a kind of beauty, a kind of self-expression, one that is to be celebrated.","I started modeling when I was - not older, but not 12. I have a mom who's a feminist - she's an English professor, an intellectual. She really gave me the equipment to understand that you can celebrate yourself without putting yourself down or needing to apologize for the way you look. I think that attitude is really crucial for a model.","I absolutely love Ireland. It's one of the most beautiful places on Earth, and I have strong ties here. Both my grandmothers are from Ireland, and I have spent every summer in Bantry since my father, who is an artist, had the romantic idea 20 years ago to buy an old farmhouse on the west coast and renovate it.","I grew up in San Diego, California, and I spent a lot of time in the summer basically living in a bathing suit, you know, get in the car and drive straight to the beach and spend the entire day in that thing, so I always approached bathing suits thinking that they are very much like outfits.","When I spend a lot of time in New York, or somewhere when I don't have a car, I miss that mobility and freedom that you have when you have a car. You don't have to rely on anyone else.","It's a weird thing. Rick Springfield wrote 'Jessie's Girl,' and he probably gets sick of talking about 'Jessie's Girl.' The thing is, I didn't write 'Blurred Lines.' I didn't direct the music video. I'm really happy for the success, but it is kind of a funny thing to follow me around.","I love men's butts.","I want to know who is spending $1,000 on a sweater! That makes no sense!","I drive a Nissan Versa and would never spend real money on a car because I destroy things.","I'm completely bathing suit-obsessed, and I love lurking on Instagram looking for the best bikinis.","I wouldn't say I am the type of girl who craves Doritos, but I definitely love a good cupcake sometimes. Or a croissant in the morning.","A woman can be seeking attention and also make a statement.They don't need to be mutually exclusive.","I'm not always going to like the paparazzi photos, but I'm still going to go to lunch with my boyfriend.","The female body is a beautiful thing, and it should be embraced and celebrated.","Hollywood is a boys' club, and that's something I thought was a stereotype - and it's not. That really shocked me. Still shocks me. Everyone's helping their buddies out and pressing their buddies and playing tennis with their buddies and making movies with their buddies, and that grosses me out.","I sleep the best in my own bed, which is too bad because I'm not sleeping in my bed enough.","I don't go out that much - usually it's just dinner.","One thing that I can say is that I think it's important that there's some sort of celebration of beautiful women that isn't just exploitive.","I genuinely hit puberty before everyone.","It sounds really cliched, but just be true to who you are.","I was real into theater, and then I tried soccer, acting and ballet. Both my parents didn't want a child-star model, so I didn't get into modeling until I was 14.","The attention from the fashion world is something that I didn't expect. I've shot with Bruce Weber and met Karl Lagerfeld. Having that kind of attention is really exciting.","When I was a little girl, I loved theater a lot and I was always playing and making my own worlds.","I think everyone has their awkward phases. Growing up isn't easy for everyone. I definitely had my awkward moments.","I think I had really good parents. I got really lucky. They said, 'You're a woman; enjoy yourself and believe that you can do things.'","I'm more of a Smithwick's or Bulmer's girl than a pint of Guinness.","I'm a big fan of the Irish accent. After a couple of drinks, I start to get a bit of an Irish lilt, too.","I'm a complete foodie, but I'm a terrible cook. If a guy can get me in the kitchen and we actually have fun cooking, that's amazing.","I grew up eating street tacos and burritos on the beach, so I like people who can eat and aren't afraid to show it.","The ideal feminist world shouldn't be one where women suppress their human instincts for attention and desire. We shouldn't be weighed down with the responsibility of explaining our every move. We shouldn't have to apologize for wanting attention, either. We don't owe anyone an explanation.","The truth is that both groups want to be noticed. Yet we view a man's desire for attention as a natural instinct; with a woman, we label her a narcissist.","It's absurd to think that desire for attention doesn't drive both women and men. Why are women scrutinized for it more, then?","Wanting attention is genderless. It's human.","People have told me to change it over the years, but my dad is always saying, 'Never change your name!' My middle name is O'Hara, so it's a pretty epic name. Emily O'Hara Ratajkowski.","I enjoy modeling. I feel that acting is more fulfilling for me, and you definitely have a lot more to contribute as an actress than you do as a model, but that being said, when I shoot with a really incredible photographer, it's exciting and inspiring.","I always have sort of been someone who has contradictory parts, and I haven't tried to uncomplicate myself. I've sort of let things seem contradictory, and sometimes it really confuses people. I don't know if it's working all the time, but I'd rather do that than try to sell myself as one thing or another.","I'd rather just be who I am and get the kind of movies that I want or the kind of modeling jobs I want based on who I am, really.","It's rare to meet somebody who's secure with herself, confident in who they are, and doesn't have anything to apologize for.","Don't buy anything online that you'd laugh at buying in real life.","For me personally, I cannot spend a certain amount of money on anything but shoes, a coat, a purse, and that's it. I could never spend more than $1K on a sweater. I'm only going to wear it twice. But you go online, and you see incredibly expensive sweaters selling out constantly.","If you're a sexy actress, it's hard to get serious roles. You get offered the same thing they've seen you in. People are like sheep, and they're like, 'Oh, that's what she does well.'","What's so dumb is that women are 50 per cent of the population, and they want to spend money to see movies where they're portrayed as three-dimensional characters.","Every woman, whether or not they're comfortable with the term 'feminist,' probably wants to be equal to men, and that is fundamentally what feminism is about.","I do my own makeup for events and red carpet stuff.","My hair is very straight - people always think that I've ironed it when I get to set.","I'm a carnivore. I really like to eat meat. I crave iron, so I am definitely not the kind of person who you will find eating a salad.","I like to keep it really balanced to give my body energy and also be healthy.","I want to establish myself as someone who can act and doesn't have to rely on my figure or modelling background.","The world should not be exclusive of the ideal body. It has to include all ideals, all bodies.","Desire is normal. Attention is normal, and that's okay.","I signed with an acting agent first; I wasn't really interested in signing with a modeling agent. But that same day, they said, 'You should go over to Ford.'","I don't know what it is, but French men love me.","Generally, I just think there is a real lacking in men knowing how to hit on women.","I think 'Everything Ravaged, Everything Burned' might be a perfect book.","I like to be asked about the projects I'm working on. I like to be asked about the books I'm reading, the things I'm interested in, what's exciting me right now, or even politics. Sometimes that's fun.","I think always what happens when you ask men questions on the red carpet, it's always based on what projects they're working on, whatever they're about, rather than this, 'Give us little tips for all of us women'... because we're all the same. Questions should just be more individual.","I feel like it's always about how this girl stays thin, or what one girl is doing to another, and it shouldn't be that way.","Female empowerment is always something that I've felt. It's not about just being a model; it's about women in general.","People will say, 'How do I get abs like you?' I don't know. We're all different. If my girlfriend did what I did, hiking and yoga for a workout, it would affect her body in a different way. That's the message that I really want to get out there. I'm trying to counteract that culture.","I cook a lot, so that really helps: You know how much salt and sugar and all of that kind of stuff you are putting in your body.","The thing to know is love yourself and find the bathing suits that make you feel comfortable and just rock it.","My mum bought discounted tickets for shows like 'Cats' and 'Les Miserables'; I became completely enamoured.","I didn't necessarily intend it for myself, but it just happens with Instagram and Twitter; people come up to me and call me Emrata; they don't call me Emily. That's my brand, my identity.","Learning how to drive was a scary thing.","I really like beef jerky. If we go to a gas station, I have to buy beef jerky.","I'm really sick of the 'one percent' that is taking all the money from this country, draining the middle class, making it nonexistent.","For me, I want a president who is more than a symbol, someone who has ideas that I align with.","We're able to choose our candidate not based on gender or sex or anything else other than their ideas.","There's nothing wrong with being comfortable in your own skin. If anything, it can be really beautiful.","I didn't want to act in high school, because I was sick of auditioning for Nickelodeon, Disney mean girls, or the cheerleader.","There is winter in L.A., there is rain in L.A. But there is no rain on 'Entourage.'","There's a reason ISIS exists, which is because we've invaded countries, and they hate the Western world. I'm not forgiving them; I'm just saying there's a reason.","I spent most of my time with adults because although my parents were older when they had me, they're really like teenagers. I sort of became the third musketeer.","When I was eleven years old, I basically looked the same as I do now.","We're animals. A body is a body.","I don't believe in proving myself, ever. I'm in the school of thought where if someone is a curious person, they can find whatever they want.","I did go to UCLA for art, but the other option was going to Sarah Lawrence and doing creative writing all the way. So that is part of the reason I love to read so much.","I don't know that it needs to be a transition from modeling to acting. I think that they can both exist at the same time.","I would really like to take on something that really surprises people and shows that I want to be taken seriously as an actress. Also, creatively speaking, that sounds really fun.","My high school didn't have a football team; we just had like a surf team, because I grew up in Encinitas, California, which is the ultimate place where everyone skated or surfed, so it was a very different culture. It was, like, cool to be the art kid.","I suck at surfing. I can't pull myself up.","I met Patti Smith, which is not Hollywood, but that really blew my mind. I love her. We were at a very small party, too, on a boat, and I totally fanned out. I told her that I loved her, and wasn't cool at all.","I think that the stigmas against model-actresses - and even just, like, entertainer, celebrity chef, and musician - those kinds of walls have been broken down, and you can do multiple things. So while I can, I don't see why I would stop.","When people are like, 'College! Oh my God! Ultimate freedom!' I didn't feel that way. My roommates were loving hitting the town, but I wasn't as psyched about going to the frats.","I've always been full-figured in a not-boyish way.","I really like to hike. L.A. is a great place for that. And doing yoga a couple of times a week is a really big part of my regimen.","Honestly, I am not a huge beauty girl, so I'm pretty low-maintenance, California.","I like going in the ocean and leaving my hair for two days with the saltwater beachy look. I think that is part of the reason I would love to cut my hair short. I just wouldn't ever have to think about it.","I really love Celine. Obviously. Alexander Wang. Givenchy. Those are probably my main favorites. Dolce & Gabbana, too.","I have the same skin-care routine morning and night, although I'm not one of those people who always uses the same products. My skin changes with the weather.","I have really big features, so a little makeup goes a long way. I would hate to look like a clown.","If I have a meeting or need to look more done up, the thing I can always do is a cat eye.","Lunch is usually a salad or a sandwich. If I'm on set, I'll have catering, but I'm well behaved with that stuff. It's easy to go crazy - they know how to feed you.","I never eat at home. Dinner is my time to be social and catch up with people.","I really like to have a moment alone at the house, either in the morning or when I come home from work, when I can just zone out at my computer, relax, stare out the window, get into a 'Game of Thrones' episode, go up on my roof, whatever, then go out to dinner.","There are some people who fit into categories very well. But then there are a lot who don't.","The main criticism that I get is, 'Aren't you just conforming to a patriarchal standard of beauty?' Well, this is just the body I was given. I didn't do anything to it - it's just my body. But even if I had altered it, that would be fine, too.","My friends are not in the industry - they're young artists or knitwear designers or whatever.","For me it's always about trying to consistently maintain a fit and body-conscious eating schedule so three days before I'm not like, 'Oh my God - I have a bathing suit shoot I have to do.'","Pop music is always great for keeping the energy up, but it can get really old, especially after eight hours, just because there aren't that many great pop songs.","I'm not about anything special - I don't use a trainer or anything like that. And really just eating healthy, eating balanced, knowing what is good and, when you push it too far, easing up and getting back on track.","I think that there are a lot of male writers and directors in Hollywood, and a lot of the female characters you do see are really one-dimensional, but I think that's changing more and more as there are more women taking control in Hollywood."],"Emily Rios":["Anything you can do to express yourself is a form of art. That's why I love my craft so much. I always wanted to play other artists. If I can't play an instrument, then I want to play a character that can. There is an artist behind everything, and I think that's beautiful.","In Latino culture, the quinceanera's a big thing - it's when a girl becomes a woman. But I think age is just a number - you become a woman with the responsibilities you take on and the decisions you make. I started realizing that every day is a gift - you have every day to be thankful you're alive.","When I was young, I thought it was normal to go to sleep to the sounds of sirens. People on my block were in the biggest gang in the city. They were my close friends - they showed me the ropes, who to watch out for.","I grew up in a highly Hispanic neighborhood. It was very rare to find any race other than Mexicans. I feel very comfortable around Spanish speakers and people from Mexico and people who don't always feel comfortable living in the U.S. because they are in fear of being deported.","You know, even growing up going to school, I had teachers that were against bilingual teaching. I never understood that. My parents always had me speak Spanish first knowing I was going to speak English in school.","I want to steer away from the stereotypes that Latina women are categorized in. I feel like there are so many more opportunities for us. I like going out for those roles that says 'open ethnicity.'","I don't want to be rude, but I'm not that social. When I say, 'I never go out,' I mean, 'I never go out.'","I would love to have a conversation with you when we're working, and if I'm at a basketball game, I'll probably talk to everyone there. That's different. But on the outside world, if I don't know you and you don't know me, I probably cannot sit there and have a conversation.","I like very dry humor. I don't like things that are over the top. I like subtlety. I like things that are nonchalant. I like characters that are sort of monotone and based in dark comedy.","TV kind of worked out naturally for me. I was fortunate to do a show like 'Breaking Bad' and then go straight into something like 'Friday Night Lights.' It's not something I focus on, but when they're great projects, I can't pass them up.","If I wanted to do TV full-time, 'Breaking Bad' is definitely the type of project I would want to do. But TV is not my favorite thing in the world. I definitely want to focus on film. It's what I grew up loving. It's always been about movies, movies, movies, movies, movies. I really want to make great films."],"Emily Robison":["I just know that I could never spend a winter in Chicago or some place like that. I'm just not a cold weather person.","Some people still believe you should just fall in line with what's going on - and that's scary. It makes a mockery of freedom of speech.","I don't think I set out to have a career in female groups, but it's just kind of happened, and by nature of having worked with my sister - growing up with a sister who also plays, and being in communication with other female musicians.","People put stock in someone being in a 'girl group,' but we don't say that a band is a 'man group.'","It's really hard to write personal songs. I'm not good at writing ditties because as far as writing hit songs that you pitch to the national artist, I just don't write that way.","I want to be playing music, and I want to be a great mom, and I want to do everything.","Constant contact is what people require these days. It's tough on artists.","Being a musician doesn't take away your right as a citizen to speak your mind.","I'm a huge Kelly Clarkson fan. I think she's great.","I think soldiers are not just one homogenous group, just like Americans aren't. They all have different feelings about the war.","I ride horses once in a while, but I'm no expert. I hold on for dear life.","When I was at high school, I thought it'd be nice to go into Air Force Academy and fly jets, but that was a very brief dream. Ha, ha. I'm too lanky to fit in the cockpit.","It is amazing what people feel they have the right to tell you to your face when you're famous.","Especially in the Dixie Chicks, everyone wants you to play a role. Natalie was the feisty one. Martie was the nice one 'cause she smiles all the time onstage, and I was the quiet one."],"Emily Rose":["It's so rare that you actually get to find a really well-written female lead.","The reason you can take the leap of faith with Stephen King, when it comes to the paranormal, or the things that happen in the world that he creates, is because the characters that he writes are accessible.","Art imitates life. It's definitely helpful to feel that way. You feel that way when you're leading a show and you're on a set.","What's so great about playing a female lead, especially in law enforcement, is that these women do exist, and they're really quite interesting. They're fascinating.","I was a huge 'Deadwood' fan because I'm a huge David Milch fan, so I've always wanted to play something like Calamity Jane on 'Deadwood' and just be the biggest Western tomboy girl, ever.","I went to Lunenburg, when we were filming there, and I was like, 'We can't film anywhere else. This place is perfect. It is 'Haven.' It's absolutely beautiful. That town is eye candy.","Every week in a small town is very different. Something is going on.","I want to do a Western so bad because I want to ride horses and act. Those are two of my favorite things in the world to do. I want to do that."],"Emily Saliers":["Whenever anybody gets involved in politics, its always exciting for me because we take for granted our freedoms and our abilities to effect change through political activism.","Artists and celebrities are citizens, and as such you have a responsibility to keep fighting for justice because there are monolithic power structures and systemic oppression out there.","I was never forced to go to church, and there is a lot of beauty in Christianity that I take in my life as a gift, and there is a lot of beauty in other religions. I'm kind of a spiritual mutt.","I was in a church choir early on and that really helped me musically in terms of chops, learning how to sing harmonies.","When I'm home, I cook. I love cooking for people.","I love Decatur. It is diverse, politically progressive, family oriented and I can walk everywhere."],"Emily V. Gordon":["Betrayal can be extremely painful, but it's up to you how much that pain damages you permanently.","Your life story is a gift, and it should be treated as such.","Being completely independent doesn't make you a strong woman - it's being strong enough to trust yourself in other people's hands that takes guts.","I have a pretty intense work ethic. If something's not done, I cannot let go until I get it done.","People all want and need different emotional responses - some people like to be talked down when they're angry; some people want to be left alone.","Cheating is very rarely about the actual act of being with another person.","Things can be tough even when surrounded by nice Pottery Barn stuff.","I remember being a teenager and feeling like I could talk to anyone anywhere about anything.","Often, when cheating happens, we rush to place blame solely on one person - either the person who did the cheating, or more insidiously, if it happened to us, we blame ourselves for not being 'good enough' to keep them around. But putting it all on one person doesn't paint the entire picture.","Holiday food is rich and indulgent. Going-home-to-see-family food is richer and even more indulgent.","Balanced, passionate, grounded people are the ones whose careers are ultimately the most successful.","You didn't have to know anything about show business to appreciate the characters' humor, because at its heart, 'Party Down' was about following dreams, dealing with rejection, and surviving all the lame jobs we've all had to work just to get by in the meantime.","'The Babadook,' written and directed by a woman, is a gorgeously told female-focused story of grief, longing, loneliness, and what mourning can become.","We all have an idea of how we like to be treated that we would like others to adhere to, and somehow we've gotten in our heads that the perfect person for us will just know what this code of behavior is.","Marriage will not change your spouse. It will not make him or her more mature, more loyal to you, or better at housework.","In some cases, newlyweds want so badly for things to be perfect that they ignore warning signs, both in themselves and each other.","Unequivocally, individual human beings who live together will always have different standards of what a 'clean house' looks like.","Without knowing your own history, you are doomed to repeat it.","When I was young and less wise, I thought that being a feminist meant being independent. It meant not sacrificing your needs for anyone else's and not relying on anyone else for even a smidgen of your happiness or well being.","Experiences don't make us damaged goods; it's what we do with those experiences that matters.","Never marry because it seems like what you should do.","I definitely think, when you're a teenager, it's more forgiving to talk to strangers and go up to people at a mall or whatever.","I had a tightly knit group of female friends in elementary school - we called ourselves the Sensational Six.","Women compete, compare, undermine, and undercut one another - at least, that is the prevailing notion of how we interact.","When we each focus on being the dominant force in our own universe rather than invading other universes, we all win.","In high school, I decided that all of my female friends were stupid and traded them for guy friends. I loved horror movies and heavy metal and used these interests to become a 'guys' girl.'","Nothing makes me feel more mushy and full of love for my husband than going back and looking at our flirtation unfolding online. I love reading our old e-mails, texts, and Gchats.","Stays at the in-laws' aren't inherently sexy.","Parents go to sleep early. This is universal.","For so long, TV consisted of a limited number of shows a year, and those shows had to appeal to as many people as possible. The joy of TV now is that shows don't have to be broad anymore - they can be small, weird, and niche.","I grew up in a very small town in North Carolina, weird and pudgy, without too many other kids to play with. I spent a lot of time watching TV. It was my reassurance that the outside world was bigger and more colorful than the one I lived in.","I'd watch shows like 'The Kids in the Hall' or 'Twin Peaks,' and I'd see weird people being celebrated and appreciated without compromising their weirdness. On 'The Facts of Life,' I'd see girls who were pudgy, beautiful, popular, tomboyish - many ways of being female - and I'd feel quietly reassured.","Far from 'rotting my brain,' as I was often told would happen, TV helped me feel less alone at a time when I spent so much time alone.","As any daytime judge show can tell you, spending someone's money or taking their stuff because they hurt your feelings is not justified.","Your wedding day is supposed to be your big day, and yet a lot of engaged couples find that instead of creating an event that will be important to them, they're dodging through a minefield of modern etiquette traps.","No matter how you handle alcohol at your wedding, you will most likely be upsetting someone.","Get married wherever you like, make accommodations for the people you love so they can attend, and forget about the people who can't.","I am fairly convinced that people plan destination weddings because they would actually like to elope but want to have given you the option to attend.","People get married for a wide array of reasons and have all sorts of expectations of how marriage will change the relationship. And while it's true that turning the person you're dating into a legal partner does affect certain things, those who expect marriage to be a cure-all for all your relationship woes are sorely mistaken.","Marriage is not a magical potion that serves to amplify adoration, reduce deep-seated feelings of resentment, erase fears of commitment, or answer questions about whether or not this is the right move. Marriage is a ceremony that cements your current bond to another human being, and while that's a huge thing, that's all it does.","Dealing with wedding stuff is a bit of a double-edged sword - it seems that divorcees are expected to either burn it all on the front lawn, tears silently coursing down their faces, or keep the stuff, shrine-like, concealed somewhere in their homes.","Keeping physical items from the past is important - we keep old toys, grandparents' jewelry, yearbooks, dance recital programs - and we assign meaning to them. Those items become the memories, and that's a very healthy thing to do. The problems occur when we have too many of those sentimental items, and they start weighing us down.","Divorce is one of the most destructive, emotionally traumatic experiences a human being can go through, no matter if you're the instigator or the recipient. It's hard, and it hurts, and it takes a long time to feel normal again.","In my professional and personal life, when I meet people who feel broken after a divorce, they can usually be divided into two categories: those who truly believe there's something wrong with them, and those that are using their status as armor.","Some divorcees turn their pain inward. They brood, and they grieve for a long time, always wondering if they could have done something differently to keep this from happening. They make every problem in their relationship into something they could have prevented.","You're not a victim of your divorce. What you decide to do with yourself and your personal life after your marriage ends is your decision, and completely under your control.","Sacrificing your relationship for your career sounds noble and romantic from the outside, but the reality is that it can create a pattern of self-destruction that will ultimately burn you out on the career you've worked so hard to build. It's a trap and, for some, an easy way out of having to maintain relationships under stress.","It's easy to isolate yourself when you're buried in work, or to rely only on work friends for empathy. And while your work friends will always 'get it' more than your life partner, they don't know how to comfort you like your partner does.","The benefits of a healthy, thriving relationship may not be nearly as exciting as watching your career take off, but both aspects of your life are equally important.","Sometimes new spouses don't fully process the commitment they've made until after the deal is done, and then they panic.","If you've experienced cheating in a new marriage, the real work is not obsessively combing through all the details of what happened, but rather figuring out if your relationship is worth saving.","If you don't simply communicate with your spouse what household tasks you would like them to do, you are setting yourself up to be angry.","As my marriage was slowly dissolving into silent meals and awkward nights of avoiding conversation, I started pondering an unmarried future and wondered if I'd ever be able to hack being single again.","Nothing makes a girl feel as unsexy as divorce.","Burlesque dancing didn't solve all my post-divorce problems, but what it did do was force me to court myself for a little while.","Hindsight is always 20/20, but I imagine a lot of married and divorced people have insights to share about how they felt during their engagement.","A lot of people end up getting married more out of expectation than out of passion for each other, but if your options have ever been, 'We either get married or break up,' be careful. Marriage should be a new addition you add to the house that is your relationship, not the structure you impose on the house once it's already built.","Sometimes we put so much effort into things we're doing, like dating or wedding planning, that we don't stop to think about whether or not we even want the results of that effort.","Marriage, even a happy and successful one, can be extremely stressful, but that stress is worth it if you're marrying the best person for you.","Ghosts of Marriages Past can haunt many aspects of a new relationship - your expectations of what a man should do, how you behave in conflict, your ideas of how commitment should look - they can even make your new man look untrustworthy when he's really behaving normally.","If you've had a marriage that ended because of a betrayal in trust on your spouse's behalf, the idea of trusting another person with your heart can seem completely ridiculous.","Sometimes we are much better at judging people based on how they treat everyone other than ourselves. We make a million excuses for why they treat us how they do.","Post-divorce, the world can feel harsh and full of jagged edges.","The period that directly follows the dissolution of a long term relationship is extremely volatile, with emotions running the gamut from misery to elation to relief to terror.","In Hollywood, it seems that the people least successful at being married are the ones most eager to tie the knot over and over again.","In my experience as a therapist and as a friend, it seems that the majority of the breakup resources available are for women and not men. Women, who tend to be more vocal about their emotional struggles, are the squeaky wheel that gets the grease from friends, from online communities, from books, and from therapeutic approaches.","Women are encouraged to go on an emotional journey of self-care after a divorce, while men are expected to need help learning how to cook and parent on their own.","Men - not all men but a good majority of the ones I have known and worked with - tend to think of difficult situations in their lives as problems that need to be solved.","After my divorce, I took some time off from having a romantic life to begin the tough work of figuring out where I'd gone wrong and what on Earth I could do to understand how to be a whole person in a relationship.","Marriage, or any committed partnership, has become sacred to me, powerful and fragile all at the same time.","I am somewhat grateful to the disintegration of my marriage for teaching me a lot about myself and about relationships, and though I wish it hadn't been such a taxing lesson, I wouldn't change a thing.","Marriage isn't just about two people who fit together well. It's about two people who figure out how to fit together well.","Awkward conversations are painful, but they're way easier than divorce, resentment, and heartbreak.","A lot of new stepparents fall into the trap of letting children disobey household expectations in order to gain favor with them.","Don't sacrifice alone time with your spouse just because the kids seem needy. A united front requires adult time alone, so put it in the calendar and make it a priority. A house cannot stand on a shaky foundation.","Do remember to pick your battles when you start parenting your stepchildren.","Don't expect yourself to immediately love your stepchildren. In fact, you may hate them for a bit.","I haven't always been the best advocate for my own body. I was a too-tall, pudgy child who felt completely out of control of the genetic lottery ticket she'd been given, so in retaliation, I shut down. I ignored my body and hated it for not being tiny and cute like my friends' bodies.","I don't remember being put into the coma, but I do have a lot of weird memories from being under. This may be because I was in a coma via medicine rather than trauma. That time period played out for me as one long rambling dream where I was at a hospital to visit my boyfriend, who I thought was in an accident.","There is no level of professional rejection that can compare to almost dying.","I have multiple tattoos.","I thought of 'The Big Sick' as a placeholder title, to be completely honest. I've grown to love it.","I think it's lovely when people are more involved in local politics.","That's part of what a relationship is: you don't experience things in the same way.","I think it's always good to get into your partner's mindset.","Love is a good thing.","Everybody's got baggage, and not just the classic, 'Oh I have so much baggage,' but everyone comes with so much context, and you're not just dating a person: you're dating all their context, too. Part of relationships is negotiating each other's context.","I always tell people, 'Take a class or volunteer.' It really helps you get out of your own little pocket of people you always see and gets you exposed to a new group of people.","Not deciding is a decision. People don't realize that not making a decision is a decision in itself.","I'm not an actress. I'm a writer.","I grew up in a town where there were no Muslims whatsoever, and there was not a lot of exposure.","I'm a mental-health advocate big time, so I think it's great when depression is a thing that's discussed out in the open, because it's still way too stigmatized.","There's nothing like listening to the drone of QVC's always-bubbly pitchwomen, as they try to move loose-fitting tunics with 'just the right amount of sparkle,' to soothe you into a healing slumber.","I'm tired of hearing about 'Damages,' I don't care how life-changing 'The Wire' is, and I don't want to hear another word about 'Battlestar Galactica' or its super-awesome ending.","If a show is a critical success but a ratings flop, I assume that people are just championing the show because it looks cool to root for an underdog.","If a show is wickedly, hugely popular, like 'Mad Men,' I assume that the masses, in their infinite inferiority to me, don't know what good TV is and that everyone is just brainwashed.","When someone insists that you watch a show that's already been on for a few seasons, they're basically saying, 'Hey, you're not doing anything for the next five weeks, are you? Because have I got a plan for you every single night! It's 'Weeds!''","Sometimes, I hate-watch television.","It's absolutely amazing to me that anyone allowed their children to watch 'The Ren & Stimpy Show' in the '90s; it's dark, gross, nihilistic, and absolutely bizarre."],"Emily VanCamp":["I've thought about going back to school.","I think it's important to be with a guy who has a strong sense of integrity. That's how I was raised, and that's something I look for.","I can be quite serious sometimes so laughing is key.","With family dramas, it's hard to keep those stories alive.","I'm a pretty open book.","I'm a big zombie buff.","I promised myself I wouldn't work again until I found something that excited me.","We live in a time where the media is a very difficult thing to navigate because it's everywhere, and I tend to want to be a lot more private with my life.","It's very important to be able to distinguish the actors from the characters they play.","I'm exhausted almost all the time.","I'm excited by challenging myself physically and mentally every day.","I've had a couple of pinch-me moments.","Oddly enough, I think that everybody can relate to revenge, on some level. Everyone has wanted to exact it, at some point, and everybody has tampered with the idea, even if they didn't actually go through with it.","I'd love to do some theater.","I think people who lack humility are really annoying.","I think women look for that quality in a man of being a good dad whether they're immediately wanting to be a parent or not.","It's important to me that a man is good at taking care of people.","I think people in general think more about their insecurities.","I don't have sociopathic tendencies!","Pilates is my favorite core strengthener. I do it three or four times a week. With all the strengthening and lengthening, it's like ballet. Plus, you get to do it lying down!","Tailoring your clothes makes all the difference.","Women are hard on themselves.","I'm trying to stop focusing on my flaws and appreciate what I love about my body.","My idea of a perfect pet is a really, really big dog! Huge!","I've been dancing my entire life. Jazz, hip hop, ballet. And then there's tap dancing. I love to tap.","I don't dig parties. I rather sit at home with my friends and a good movie.","I've given up looking for a boyfriend. That's not to say I won't be interested if the right guy comes along. But I'm not in a hurry."],"Emily Watson":["I mean, I have done scenes with animals, with owls, with bats, with cats, with special effects, with thespians, in the freezing cold, in the pouring rain, boiling hot; I've done press with every syndication, every country; I've done interviews with people dressed up as cows - there's honestly nothing that's gonna intimidate me!","I was a normal, rather dutiful child. I didn't even rebel as a teenager.","It's a whole different kind of anxiety. But the great thing about doing a theatre job is that once the ball starts rolling you just have to go with it, it's inexorable.","You have to play the logic of a character.","Yeah, a lot of people think I'll be a tortured nutcase when they meet me.","When the time came to make a decision about what do in life, I found myself thinking that acting was the thing I loved to do, so I applied to drama school. And then, I didn't get in - twice.","When I did get home this last time, we had all these plans to go out. And then we hardly stepped outside because the time together seemed too precious.","My husband. He keeps me grounded. If I were in the world on my own, it would all be much more seductive. But I'm in a relationship that has nothing to do with the film world.","My character Lena is somebody who responds to people in a very simple way. I didn't have to take myself off to a darkened room to concentrate, I just had to try and be open. It's an interesting, subtle relationship.","It's an incredible privilege for an actor to look into the camera. It's like looking right into the heart of the film, and you can't take that lightly.","The film Punch - Drunk Love is how you see the world when you're in love. You don't see somebody's psychological baggage necessarily, you see the person walking out of the light.","I've always been creative, I think.","I think so, Silence of the Lambs was a great, suspenseful thriller and I would expect Red Dragon to be similar. And I think it's very character driven.","I grew up without a television. It meant that I read lots of books and entertained myself.","I don't think I will be less good because there's less pressure on me.","I do think you feel a little bit like you are preying on people's lives.","I always think I am going to do my best.","During Breaking The Waves, I was on my own in a hotel room. I think I would have been impossible to live with. When you go home, you have to pretend to be the person you are at home.","As actors, we went where we wanted to, and the camera followed us: it was like having another person in the room. There was no formal structure to the process. It was very liberating.","And it is very sexy as well: somebody says I'm taking you on a surprise date, you don't know where you are going and you can't see and then you put your hand out and there is a tiger. Amazing.","Now, honestly, every movie set that I go on, I walk onto set with the confidence that there is nothing that they can throw at me that's gonna surprise me.","I sometimes feel like it's difficult for people to relate to me, until they spend, like, a day with me, and until they walk around with me in public.","I have to be a lot more calculating because I'm a very private person. I actually really struggle with the attention; I'm generally a pretty shy kind of a person. So it's tough figuring out how to manage it. But there are ways of managing it, and you just have to be smart.","I was a pretentious child. I grew up without a television. I read a lot of books and I loved Shakespeare. Still do.","In my early career I was like a goldfish. Rejection didn't affect me; I'd just forget how bad it was and keep going back for more.","I don't know what makes a marriage work. My husband and I don't have it right at all; it's very tough on him. From the outside it looks like it's all about me - I have a glorious career and he doesn't.","Believing in God is a very intense inner struggle of mine. It's something I worry about a lot, but which I don't have the answer to.","Please, please, please - I would love to do some comedy. Once you have a reputation for one thing - in my case, crying and dying - you are typecast.","I am married to the most amazing, generous and beautiful human being and it has been hard on him because from the outside if you look at it it's just all about me."],"Emily Weiss":["The ideal intern is committed, creative, organized, ambitious, independent, and able to crack a smile, whether meeting a celebrity or folding socks.","In beauty, there's this idea of this perfect picture, and I think, 'How about being present in the now, and a little messy?'","You can make a million excuses for why something didn't go well, but ultimately, just fix it and get on with it. Be a solutions person.","In my humble opinion, having tons of products and furniture and magazines and clothes is not luxurious - living minimally is.","The single guiding principle that I try to follow, assuming blindly that the rest will fall into place, is to operate squarely in the present. I think it's one of the most difficult things for anyone to do.","I approached fundraising as an opportunity to align myself with partners who have more varied experience and diverse backgrounds than I do to help bring Glossier to life.","If you're interested in a 'Teen Vogue' internship, take note: it's not all fun and games! Working at a magazine requires a ton of energy and endurance from its interns and editors alike.","Sunscreen, in the world of beauty, is the ultimate in adulting.","So much of venture capital is pattern recognition.","I just have to stop biting my nails. I've been on and off that bandwagon so many times. I feel like it's going to be a lifelong struggle.","Elin Kling is one of the most stylish women I know.","I've never been one for color theory or color wheels or undertone rules or anything like that. I don't know if my red lipstick 'should' be more blue or more orange.","I have long been of the mindset that aviators are like leather jackets - when they're perfect, they give you 'instant cool.' They're the Alexa Chung of sunglasses.","I like a semi-stressful massage - one where I can really feel something being worked out.","For male and female entrepreneurs alike, having a woman investor can bring credibility when discussing product positioning and expansion opportunities.","Our message has always transcended borders and cultures and is central to who we are as a brand.","I've had some not-great experiences with laser hair removal, probably because I haven't done what they told me.","Freedom and confidence are two different things, in my book. Confidence is overrated - it can be faked, whereas freedom is fearlessness.","My first lip balms were Bonne Bell Lip Smackers, which, correct me if I'm wrong, sometimes had little bracelets attached to the caps-meaning your lip balm could idly dangle from your wrist like a charm bracelet when not in use, not unlike some iPhone accessories.","When you own a pair of haircutting scissors, you cut your own hair constantly.","That power of the individual person - just the girl - is infinite.","I don't even need to know - if you have something to prove to your old boss or your dad or your third grade teacher or yourself, it doesn't matter. You need that hustle and that fire, and I don't care where it comes from.","Your skin is like a plant. You have to water it. Make sure it's hydrated, not just squeaky clean.","I grew up in a conservative New England town and showed up to my middle school orientation dressed like 'Clueless' while everyone else was wearing J. Crew and lacrosse uniforms. I never really fit into that preppy look.","When your lips get dry, is there anything more frantic?","If you look dull, the easiest thing to do is wash your face with water, and immediately you look refreshed.","One of the big things I've learned over the years and I'm excited that Glossier perpetuates is that wherever you're at, in terms of your scope of knowledge around beauty, is totally okay. And not just okay, but actually really valuable.","My wardrobe falls into two camps most of the time: either very monochromatic and tailored or really vintagey, with '30s and '40s-style long floral dresses. I don't buy that much, so every time I invest in something new, it has to elevate what I have hanging in my closet.","I'm surrounded by women whose style I admire. It's natural to be inspired. I'm not a horrible copycat, or if I am, then I admit it and make a joke about it.","When Glossier launched in the U.S. back in 2014, it felt small - but in a good way. We were able to introduce ourselves locally, start a community, and build something special together.","This is hard to admit, but historically, I haven't worn sunscreen. I know - not good.","Throughout your teens and twenties, it's pretty easy to live in a suspended reality - one where you never get old or need to spend much time thinking about 401Ks, mammograms, or renewing your license. You don't need me to tell you: that ends.","Instagram has a faster chance of reaching me than CNN, and if I really want to know what's going on, I refresh my Twitter feed.","We wanted Glossier to have an excellent customer experience and reach as many of you as possible from day one, so we went with venture - the stuff fast-growth, tech-enabled companies like Facebook, Amazon, and Apple are made of.","We'll continue to invest in new technology because we think every woman should have the ability to be connected through her beauty knowledge, opinions, products, and routine.","Where Halloween is concerned, I peaked in 2007.","Into The Gloss is buoyed by the people on it, the people who read it and discuss it, and the people who work on it.","For some, Into The Gloss is just a blog, and that's cool. For us, it's the connective tissue between us and you, and that has paved the way for the creation of a very different kind of beauty brand: Glossier.","Products are a way to connect with - or disconnect from - who you are.","Glossier - our content, our products - it's for all for you; it's ours.","Unlike a celebrity, there's nothing I won't try and nothing I won't talk about when it comes to my hair. If I were to get a tattoo on my inner upper arm, it would read, 'Change thy hair, change thyself.'","What no one tells you - or maybe they did tell me, and I chose not to listen - is that there's really no 'coming back' from bleached platinum hair. You sort of have to cut it all off and start over.","My December is typically one big, sweaty 'wintry mix' blur, not a punch-laden, heartwarming mixer.","Women are truly, truly awesome.","People often ask me, 'How do you go about choosing who to feature on Into The Gloss?' And I've never had a great answer. Ultimately, I think the #1 thing that draws me to someone is their sense of freedom.","My musical inclinations are fine and dandy within the confines of my ears and my earphones but don't sit well with others.","I would rather be 'oily' than 'dry' on pretty much any part of my body.","Nobody said being platinum was easy.","French pharmacies probably feel like CVS to French people, but to me, they feel like a real-life version of 'Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory.'","The guardians of French pharmacies - the lab-coated salespeople - are busy, serious, and probably know more about your face than you do. Therefore, don't interrupt them, and if they ask you if they can help you, for God's sake, let them. They will not steer you wrong.","When I think of baths, I generally think of children, the elderly, couples, and the English. Who takes baths? I mean, seriously - none of my friends take baths.","My brain puts baths in the same category as yoga: it'd be 'nice' to relax for an hour, but I just want a 10-minute, high-impact workout; get in, get out. Showers are my cardio.","Augmenting your appearance so drastically that it elicits a reaction from literally every acquaintance you greet is a sea change.","People talk about body cleanses like there's no tomorrow - what about apartment cleanses?","I am, in fact, a candle salesperson's worst nightmare - or dream come true, depending on the salesperson.","I must admit that self-tanner is one beauty arena I've been hesitant to explore, let alone fully embrace.","Over the years of running Into The Gloss, I began to see a gap in the way beauty companies were creating products and marketing them to women. There wasn't one brand that really spoke to girls like me, who created products for real life. So we set out to create that brand with Glossier.","At Glossier, we're creating an edited collection of the best essential products. These are the ones that you reach for every day and will always have a place on your top shelf.","I am crazy for good branding and really admire companies that get it right.","I love someone with something to prove.","We're trying to create one holistic beauty experience where you can be inspired by other women, both the people we're interviewing and the community contributing to the conversation.","A huge number of women are shopping for beauty products based on recommendations from friends, and we really look to be that friend.","Glossier is really for anyone who wants to embrace the present and live in the now. It's about embracing constant change and who you are at any given moment, and that's often someone who's imperfect - and that's cool.","We want to demystify and present things in real talk. That's why Into the Gloss struck a nerve. Glossier is not much different. We're providing this rich environment around products that help consumers understand their benefit.","I knew that I wanted to intern at 'Teen Vogue' from the moment the first issue hit newsstands. Luckily, the team at Polo Ralph Lauren, where I interned during high school, really believed in me and arranged for an interview with the editors.","The great thing about interning at 'Teen Vogue' is that there is so much room for growth; interns here do incredible things if they work hard enough and think outside the box.","If I want to know how to do a black cat eye, I don't drive to a department store. I'll go on YouTube, cross-check reviews of a product, and then maybe talk about it on Instagram.","We're not telling you that you need a concealer. We're providing a concealer in case you want it. We're trying to give you the tools to be able to make whatever decision you want.","I'm not afraid of being told 'no.'","At 'Vogue,' I was responsible for a lot of production work, and production work is highly detailed, and you have to be very resourceful to fit a square peg into a round hole. I learned to push the envelope when it comes to asking questions or making requests.","I always thought 'Into The Gloss' would be successful, but I didn't really know what my definition of success was.","With 'Into The Gloss' and now Glossier, the reason it was successful was because there were so many like-minded women out there who were also dissatisfied with their beauty experiences.","I think reality television has made the fashion industry and the beauty industry, any industry - frankly, just life - it has made life seem much different than it really is.","I eat out alone a lot.","We incorporate a lot of natural ingredients into our Glossier products, like sweet almond oil, which is great at getting moisture deep into the skin.","I like to get rid of things; I don't collect many things. But I do keep great photography and art books.","I like books that explore identity and youth culture or rites of passage.","I feel like I have time to think when I'm in L.A. There's something about the spaciousness of it.","Glossier is not about throwing out everything you're using. If you want to keep using your retinols, your SPFs, of course you should continue.","Everyone says to hydrate on the plane, but I don't.","It's very important to me to have a female venture capitalist.","I'm on Instagram more than any other social platform.","You don't need most beauty products. They're an emotional purchase. That's why the conversations are really important. What choice do you have but to ask your customer what they want?","Making a bougie, expensive beauty brand wasn't helping the mission or very fun for me. We can all be united by that $12 coconut balm. You don't need to charge an arm and a leg.","We could be like a lot of consumer brands that start blogs after they start their business. But in our case, I think Glossier is still very much a content company. I think about our products themselves as pieces of content.","Ultimately, we're making and selling a consumer good that needs to work and that needs to make customers happy.","I read every single comment that comes in.","In our product development cycle, we ask and listen to our customer about what she wants.","I just grew up loving beauty products. Going to the mall, and the Stila counter in the '90s. I was obsessed with hair dye.","I'm a lover and consumer of beauty.","Beauty is very intimate.","Toronto girls are super interested in skincare, which is actually kind of unique. Because in New York, the girls seem to be mostly interested in makeup.","'Into The Gloss,' what I think it did so well was create a conversation around beauty and make beauty the main event as opposed to the ugly step-sister, which it often is in magazines.","The creation of 'Into The Gloss' took less than a month. Glossier took twelve months and about a million dollars to hire the team, work with the chemists, order the inventory, get an office - you know, the whole thing.","I've had such an inspiring and formative journey in my career.","I like people who work hard.","My desk is more of a place where I set my stuff, and then I move around. If I'm at the office, I'm usually wandering around to different meeting rooms all day or taking people out or making tea. I'm rarely at my desk; it's just a place to hang my hat.","You learn a lot about people when you're sitting on their bathroom floor or on their toilet seat, rifling through their stuff.","I love supporting female-owned companies and women who are awesome.","There's so much pressure on women to have it all together. There's always this 'next, next, next.' I hope Glossier encourages women to be O.K. wherever you are. Just, everyone, relax!"],"Eminem":["The truth is you don't know what is going to happen tomorrow. Life is a crazy ride, and nothing is guaranteed.","Somewhere deep down there's a decent man in me, he just can't be found.","I'm stupid, I'm ugly, I'm dumb, I smell. Did I mention I'm stupid?","Trust is hard to come by. That's why my circle is small and tight. I'm kind of funny about making new friends.","I say what I want to say and do what I want to do. There's no in between. People will either love you for it or hate you for it.","Everybody has goals, aspirations or whatever, and everybody has been at a point in their life where nobody believed in them.","I was a smart kid, but I hated school.","A lot of truth is said in jest.","Dealing with backstabbers, there was one thing I learned. They're only powerful when you got your back turned.","These times are so hard, and they're getting even harder.","Sometimes I feel like rap music is almost the key to stopping racism.","If people take anything from my music, it should be motivation to know that anything is possible as long as you keep working at it and don't back down.","I always wished for this, but it's almost turning into more of a nightmare than a dream.","To the people I forgot, you weren't on my mind for some reason and you probably don't deserve any thanks anyway.","I was going to McDonald's and Taco Bell every day. The kids behind the counter knew me - it wouldn't even faze them. Or I'd sit up at Denny's or Big Boy and just eat by myself. It was sad. I got so heavy that people started to not recognize me.","I am whatever you say I am; if I wasn't, then why would you say I am.","It sometimes feels like a strange movie, you know, it's all so weird that sometimes I wonder if it is really happening.","Anything I've ever said, I certainly was feeling at the time.","I love the attention but I don't like too much of it.","I do say things that I think will shock people. But I don't do things to shock people. I'm not trying to be the next Tupac, but I don't know how long I'm going to be on this planet. So while I'm here, I might as well make the most of it.","People can try to reinvent themselves. I don't think you can really change who you are, though, because who you are is pretty much where you came from and what you've done up to now.","My overall look on things is a lot more mature than it used to be.","Hip-hop saved my life, man. It's the only thing I've ever been even decent at. I don't know how to do anything else.","When Bugs Bunny walks into rehab, people are going to turn and look. People at rehab were stealing my hats and pens and notebooks and asking for autographs. I couldn't concentrate on my problem.","Nobody likes to fail. I want to succeed in everything I do, which isn't much. But the things that I'm really passionate about, if I fail at those, if I'm not successful, what do I have?","I've been running a lot, taking care of myself.","My father? I never knew him. Never even seen a picture of him.","I didn't just invent saying offensive things.","I realized, 'Yo, I can't do anything in moderation. I don't know how.'","I need drama in my life to keep making music.","I am who I am and I say what I think. I'm not putting a face on for the record.","My thing is this; if I'm sick enough to think it, then I'm sick enough to say it.","I need to keep working on myself for a while.","You're not going to say anything about me that I'm not going to say about myself. There's so many things that I think about myself; if someone really wanted to get at me, they could say this and this and this. So I'm going to say it before they can. It's the best policy for me.","Why is it so hard for people to believe that white people are poor?! I wouldn't say I lived in a ghetto; I'd say I lived in the 'hood. The same friends I had back then are the same people on tour with me now.","I was poor white trash, no glitter, no glamour, but I'm not ashamed of anything.","I'm very much a creature of habit.","Now that I understand that I'm an addict, I definitely have compassion for my mother. I get it.","Ultimately, who you choose to be in a relationship with and what you do in your bedroom is your business.","Honestly, I'd love to be remembered as one of the best to ever pick up a mic, but if I'm doing my part to lessen some racial tension I feel good about what I'm doing.","Yeah, I did see where the people dissing me were coming from. But, it's like, anything that happened in the past between black and white, I can't really speak on it, because I wasn't there. I don't feel like me being born the color I am makes me any less of a person.","Nothing on 'Relapse' and very little on 'Recovery' was produced by me.","It'd be stupid for me to sit here and say that there aren't kids who look up to me, but my responsibility is not to them. I'm not a baby sitter.","Being a student of hip-hop in general, you take technical aspects from places. You may take a rhyme pattern or flow from Big Daddy Kane or Kool G Rap.","I think my first album opened a lot of doors for me to push the freedom of speech to the limit.","I don't think I've ever read poetry, ever.","Certainly I'm not going to sit on the Internet all day and read what Sam from Iowa is saying about me. But I'm a sponge. I've always been a sponge.","I don't know if I ever feel totally great about a record when I put it out. With every record that I put out, someone has literally got to come pry it from me because when I listen to my own music, I just hear flaws in it.","I don't think I've ever read poetry, ever. I'm not really book-smart.","Before I was famous, when I was just working in Gilbert's Lodge, everything was moving in slow motion.","Rap was my drug.","I try to treat all the money I'm making like it's the last time I'm going to make it.","Guns are bad, I tell you.","You know, fame is a funny thing, man, especially, you know, actors, musicians, rappers, rock singers, it's kind of a lifestyle and it's easy to get caught up in it - you go to bars, you go to clubs, everyone's doing a certain thing... It's tough.","I might talk about killing people, but that doesn't mean I do it.","The emotions in a song - the anger, aggression - have got to be legitimate.","Throughout my career, I fed off the fuel of people not being able to understand me.","When you're a little kid, you don't see color, and the fact that my friends were black never crossed my mind. It never became an issue until I was a teenager and started trying to rap.","I don't think I ever thought of myself as Superman. But there were people who thought of me that way, and maybe I believed them a little.","I don't hate women - they just sometimes make me mad.","A lot of my rhymes are just to get chuckles out of people. Anybody with half a brain is going to be able to tell when I'm joking and when I'm serious.","I come from Detroit where it's rough and I'm not a smooth talker.","There was certainly, like, a rebellious, like, youthful rage in me. And there was also the fact of no getting away from fact that I am white, and you know, this is predominantly black music, you know.","A lot of the problems I had with fame I was bringing on myself. A lot of self-loathing, a lot of woe-is-me. Now I'm learning to see the positive side of things, instead of, like, 'I can't go to Kmart. I can't take my kids to the haunted house.'","Fame hit me like a ton of bricks.","It feels good to have your work respected again.","Hip-hop is ever changing but you'll always have the pack. And you'll always have those people who are separated from the pack.","If there's not drama and negativity in my life, all my songs will be really wack and boring or something.","Well, I'm working all the time to stay out of trouble!","I didn't have nothin' going for me... school, home... until I found something I loved, which was music, and that changed everything.","It's just hard to meet new people, in my position.","I don't even know how to speak up for myself, because I don't really have a father who would give me the confidence or advice. And if you're always the new kid, you never get a chance to adapt, so your confidence is just zilch.","Personally, I just think rap music is the best thing out there, period. If you look at my deck in my car radio, you're always going to find a hip-hop tape; that's all I buy, that's all I live, that's all I listen to, that's all I love.","The kids are old enough now - I just want to let them be kids. I don't want to comment on them too much. They're at an age where I just want to let them be kids.","Anybody with a sense of humor is going to put on my album and laugh from beginning to end.","I'd go to, like, six different schools in one year. We were on welfare, and my mom never ever worked.","I feel like a spoilt rapper. I get to pick and choose everything.","I have a slight bit of OCD, I think. I'm not walking around flipping light switches. But when I say I'm going to do something, I have to do it.","Music is so therapeutic for me that if I can't get it out, I start feeling bad about myself - a lot of self-loathing.","I want to solidify as an artist and show that as I grow as a person and make mistakes and learn from them, I'm going to grow artistically.","Sporadic thoughts will pop into my head and I'll have to go write something down, and the next thing you know I've written a whole song in an hour.","You know, not to sound corny or nuthin', but I felt like a fighter comin' up, man. I felt like, you know, I'm being attacked for this reason or that reason, and I gotta fight my way through this.","It creeps me out sometimes to think of the person I was. I was a terrible person. I was mean to people.","Honestly, I never really put the mic down.","Say there's a white kid who lives in a nice home, goes to an all-white school, and is pretty much having everything handed to him on a platter - for him to pick up a rap tape is incredible to me, because what that's saying is that he's living a fantasy life of rebellion.","There was a while when I was feeling like, 'Damn, if I'd just been born black, I would not have to go through all this'.","I felt like I had a really bad case of writer's block... Music is so therapeutic for me that if I can't get it out, I start feeling bad about myself - a lot of self-loathing.","I'm not really book-smart.","The details surrounding both my marriage and subsequent filing for divorce are private, and I had hoped to keep them that way for the sake of my family.","The album requires a certain focus of mine that I can't really explain - let's just say it's all I can really do while I'm doing it.","The writing process, the way I go about it is I do whatever the beat feels like, whatever the beat is telling me to do. Usually when the beat comes on, I think of a hook or the subject I want to rap about almost instantly. Within four, eight bars of it playing I'm just like, 'Oh, OK. This is what I wanna do'.","I always felt that if I was going to do a movie, I wanted it to be authentic.","My family has never been there for me. They expect things because we're blood.","I always try to be smart. I try to treat all the money I'm making like it's the last time I'm going to make it.","As for my stuff, I'm just doing guest verses for other people's records. I try to stay recording, because if I don't, I get rusty.","It's kind of like a challenge to myself to be able to hear somebody else's hook and kind of interpret the words. Because my own hooks, I already know what I mean when I write them.","I always say this about my music, and music in general: Music is like a time capsule. Each album reflects what I'm going through or what's going on in my life at that moment.","My only scheme was to be a rapper.","I want to keep making records as long as I can, but I don't know how long you can be taken seriously in rap.","Touring is hard on the body.","I don't even know how to speak up for myself, because I don't really have a father who would give me the confidence or advice.","Hip hop has always been braggin' and boasting and 'I'm better at you than this' and 'I'm better at you than that.'","If you're the parent, be a parent. You know what I mean? I'm a parent. I have daughters.","I've accomplished enough with the music that I haven't had to go out there and do other things to over-saturate.","I stopped watching TV because of 'The Wire.' Like, 'The Wire' ruined everything for me because I don't even want to watch anything else now.","When 'Paul's Boutique' came out, I was one of the fans that didn't get it.","Five or six songs leaked from the original version of 'Encore.' So I had to go in and make new songs to replace them."],"Emir Kusturica":["I never wanted an independent Bosnia. I wanted Yugoslavia. That is my country.","The advantage of the gypsy language, even though I don't understand it that much, the language is perfect melody. So if you propose the movie the way I do, then the language is just one part of the melody. Orchestrating all inside, and the language is following the meaning of what they say, and it's never the same as written.","You know, in each segment of ex-Yugoslavia, multi-ethnic life is lost, except I think we somehow still have this in Serbia.","Making movies is a dangerous job. Because you are always the one who stands at the center of the universe when making movies.","Yugoslavia was a kind of superpower. Great movies. Beautiful novels. Great rock-and-roll. We became a superpower in basketball. The problem is that people needed to identify more strongly with it after Tito and his awful, tricky way of leading the country.","That is a Medieval way of drawing history, in which they do not respect the law and want the rest of the world to respect the law. That's not possible.","I will not cut my film because, because, because, because of the Wonderful Wizard of Oz.","I put my ideas into practice. That may be the reason people hate me.","I've been around some very famous people, but no one has the effect Maradona has; people tremble in his presence.","Just because I believe in the identity and integrity of my country doesn't make a xenophobe or a nationalist.","Every time I'm shooting a movie I want to kill myself. Because I don't see the light in the end of the tunnel.","In Serbia a lot of people hate me because they want to westernize, not understanding that the western world is bipolar, with very good things and very bad things.","What you have now is a Hollywood that is pure poison. Hollywood was a central place in the history of art in the 20th century: it was human idealism preserved. And then, like any great place, it collapsed, and it collapsed into the most awful machinery in the world.","My purpose is to make a movie to make you warm. To give you some heat. Now, this rational world has become a place where only what is cool is good. Do you cut the movie on the basis of the beat of modernity or the basis of the beat of your own heart?","I am finished with cities. I spent four years in New York, ten in Paris, and I was in Belgrade for a while. To me now they are just airports.","I'm fed up with democracy. In a democracy, people vote for the mayors. I wanted to build a city where I will choose the citizens.","Every movie that I do, if you analyze the stories, you can notice that in each story, that within the movie after the first 15 minutes, it could fall apart. Or every 10 minutes it has the chance that you lose the thread. On the other hand, if you succeed in putting them together, then the movie looks spontaneous and more like cinema.","The most difficult part of making movies is to keep making them. Maybe, you could make the biggest hit in the world, but then the big problem is what to do next and how to maintain devoted to a certain instinct that I have about films.","I am a living illustration of Bosnian mixing and converting. My grandparents lived in eastern Herzegovina. Very poor. The Turks came and brought Islam. There were three brothers in the family. One was Orthodox Christian. The other two took Islam to survive.","I was a big fighter when I was younger. In bars I was ready to explode and fight.","I've reached the 50th year of my life, and now every question related with life also includes thinking about death. When I leave, I want to leave to my offspring a clear idea about identity."],"Emm Gryner":["I'm interested in astrology and astronomy.","After touring with David Bowie last year, I was inspired to look at what I wanted to do as an artist, and I realized I wanted to go back to the music I fell in love with when I was eight years old.","Writing has become such an outlet for me that when I don't have it, I just get pent up.","I traveled nonstop in 2009, so when my son popped out and my passport expired for a while, I felt more than happy just to be at home here in Canada.","If I never saw another airport again, I'd be happy!","My heart has been resuscitated as a result of becoming a mom.","I want to be honest, and even if that's scary, I know it's worth it."],"Emma Anderson":["I think some people found the production took away from the actual songs, which I can understand.","The worst thing is always thinking of titles for records, with some reason behind them, and she just came out with the word, which she thought was a good word, a hard word, and since then we've sort of attached loads of meaning to it.","No, my degree was history, not the practice of art! I can't draw to save my life you know.","We had so much press, and then they get bored... I think we've done well to keep going."],"Emma Bell":["I love just how beautiful Vancouver is. I mean, everywhere you look it's just mountains and ocean.","I've worked with some of the most inspiring and genuinely nice people.","I feel like we're attracted to paths in life that force us to look at our weaknesses or deficiencies as human beings. Not to get all deep on you, but that's how I feel.","If I weren't acting, I would own my own chocolate shop in Paris. I would be a nice, overweight person that makes chocolate all day long.","I love really, really deep, dark-as-Russia storylines. I love supernatural aspects. I grew up with ghost stories.","I live in L.A. - I love L.A., first off - but I didn't realize how much better the air quality was in Vancouver until I went back to L.A. for a weekend and I literally felt like I was breathing fire."],"Emma Bonino":["I was very restless, but finally I found my way.","My mother's studies stopped with the third year of primary school, my father with the first. They taught me a deep sense of duty. But nobody was involved in politics in my family.","I thought there had to be something I could do because it seemed crazy that, in addition to the psychological tragedy each woman has to face, came also all the rest.","My family had liberal positions.","My mother was a regular church-goer and was very tolerant.","Women movements would form among the factory workers, a great mobilisation that destroyed the old models.","I met the Radicals and we liked each other reciprocally.","I was on leave from local and regional politics, as long as I was a Minister.","I felt that what is personal is political.","The two great cultural and political currents of Italy have always only been concerned with the masses.","The individual couldn't find any attention in Italy.","I was thrown into the Parliament right away. From 1976 to 1978 I was concerned with the abortion issue, later on with that of divorce.","I should have worried about taking responsibilities for which I was not ready.","The knowledge of languages was very useful. I have a university degree in foreign languages and literature.","I mean to defend the rights of individuals in a liberal prospect.","I am positive that flexibility is a feminine characteristic.","Women are clear-headed, they are more creative and for this reason, sometimes, also more fragile.","I am now concerned with women's issues in a different way: women from Afghanistan, from Cambodia.","I think nowadays economic liberties are an explosive issue.","A woman must combine the role of mother, wife and politician.","Men don't have as many difficulties and are more supported to combine the different aspects of their life.","The fact remains; chauvinism is prevailing.","We are aware of the strategic location of Kuwait, besides the stable region.","I support the recommendations made by the International Crisis Group. The primary responsibility is for Kosovo Albanians to demonstrate that their treatment of minorities is adequate.","The EU should have consolidated its different presences and purposes in Kosovo earlier.","The speed of movement towards independence will depend on Kosovo demonstrating that it is capable of treating minorities well. We have not always seen that.","Kosovo's destiny is clearly to join the European Union at some point.","Albania has to demonstrate that it is willing to be a reliable partner in the international community.","Macedonia's handling of ethnic relations and other issues is encouraging.","Drafting a constitution is only the first step. The constitution has to be granted legitimacy by open discussion and a fair, representative referendum."],"Emma Bull":["Coincidence is the word we use when we can't see the levers and pulleys.","They don't know how the world is shaped. And so they give it a shape, and try to make everything fit it. They separate the right from the left, the man from the woman, the plant from the animal, the sun from the moon. They only want to count to two."],"Emma Bunton":["I don't think I will ever get tired of wearing pink.","Be sweet, be good, and honest always.","I've got a Range Rover and a little Mercedes. I normally drive my Range Rover because I feel like a monster in it. Nobody messes with me.","I think the way to keep a friendship is to respect that everybody is different.","Be yourself, take control of your life.","We're all doing different things and some of the girls are mums, so priorities have changed. But I would love to do something with the Spice Girls again. I know we would have an amazing time.","I'm not a pop star.","I'm not a big sports fan, but I love it when they 'slam dunk.' That's sexy.","I love shopping, especially food shopping.","I do have panic attacks every time I go on stage so I'm really not sure why I put myself through this.","Be sweet and honest always, but for God's sake don't eat my doughnuts!","My family brought me up to be very respectful of people.","I do believe in fate.","I've become saucy.","I love watching reality shows - I'm up to date with 'America's Next Top Model' and I love 'Project Runway.' But the shows where they're just sitting in a house aren't as fun to me!","Please ignore rumors! I've had them for years and you have to just let them go over your head. Don't take them personally.","I think people recognize me if I am going out to dinner or if I am staying in a hotel. They are not quite sure at first because I have grown up a lot.","Just being at home, growing up naturally, and being here now with my video and my music, I think people realize that I was in the Spice Girls 8 years ago.","I am a huge fan of Gwen Stefani.","I do love a man who can cook."],"Emma Caulfield":["Sunday is my favorite day.","I think talking about one's love life is always... It's a Pandora's box, best kept in journals.","I don't get a chance to do many of my own stunts on 'Buffy' - none of us do. We have amazing stunt people who make us all look really believable and really good.","The best advice is to take it easy, respect speed limits and do not try to make up time lost in the tailbacks on the open road.","I think my strongest suit is comedy. I certainly have limits in other areas.","I'm a huge science fiction fan.","There's no adventure in knowing the outcome of who you're supposed to be with.","We're far more defined by our mistakes than the things that we succeed at.","I had no interest in being your basic vanilla girl. I've been lucky enough that I haven't had to play that.","I definitely gravitate towards quality genre projects and genre of any kind whether it's science fiction, horror or really anything. I'm just drawn to quality. I don't think 'Darkness Falls' is horror; there isn't any gore by any stretch of the imagination.","I'm a big fan of being scared I like being scared. I like being involved in a film that will make audiences scared, that intrigues me.","I've never considered stand-up. Luckily I'm given great lines to say. I'm not sure how great my timing would be if I actually had to come up with my own jokes.","I think my worst nightmare is standing up in front of a group of people.","For a while now I've had this feeling that there's something that I'm supposed to be doing or something that I'm supposed to contribute. I don't know what that is yet, but it's been plaguing me - like I've missed my calling somehow.","I'm very passionate about animals.","No matter how successful you get in Hollywood, you cannot rest. Your new movie doesn't open well; they're looking for the next person to replace you; it's always something. You never have true peace.","Bandwagon and all that it is is such a huge passion of mine. We're already bouncing around ideas for season three, what we would call our golden ticket, in terms of a celebrity we would pair up with. We have a few in mind, and a few topics.","I don't really care if people get upset. I think I'm doing my job if people get upset; I want them to think! We all want them to think, hopefully.","I'm a huge fan of 'Community'; it's, I think, one of the most brilliant comedy on television and has been for a long time.","We love having the freedom that we have with the web; I mean, we don't have to answer to anybody. We have complete creative control; we don't have to worry about FCC regulations.","I find that when I'm ready for something to end, I transition quickly. But when something ends before its time, I find it hard to move on."],"Emma Donoghue":["I tend to be so lost in the work that I don't notice the weather. My partner will come home and say, 'Beautiful day, wasn't it?' and I'll say, 'Was it?' as I won't have noticed the real world at all.","The way to my heart is through Belgian milk chocolate.","One thing I like about historical fiction is that I'm not constantly focusing on me, or people like me; you're obliged to concentrate on lives that are completely other than your own.","I think the only difference between me and other people is that when I hear of an interesting historical incident, I immediately write it down and Google it.","Some writers can produce marvelous plots without planning it out, but I can't. In particular I need to know the structure of a novel: what's going to happen in each chapter and each scene.","I think it would be a shame for any writer to let their publishers in any way corral them into a single genre.","I've always been religiously inclined, but it doesn't come up in most of my books.","Kids delight in 'magical thinking', whether in the form of the Tooth Fairy or the saints: whether you see these as comforting lies or eternal verities, they are part of how we help kids make sense of the world.","Before I had kids, I thought you should never lie to a kid. But now I've had them, I realize you almost lie to them by definition, because if you're trying to summarize something for your 1-year-old, you put it in very simple terms. You only gradually complicate the explanation as they get older.","I'm a huge planner, more and more so as the years go by.","I'm constantly saying, 'I read a fascinating article in 'The New Yorker'... ' I say it so often that sometimes I think I have nothing interesting to say myself, I merely regurgitate 'The New Yorker.'","Ah yes, the paradox of publicity is that even as we do it, we know it's killing off the chance of another reader happening across our book in the ideal state of innocence.","I'm finding that success is way more time-consuming than failure ever was.","I come out of an academic background, and I'm aware that what I'm doing is simultaneously research and fiction. I want to meet both those obligations.","You're meant to have an unhappy childhood to be a writer, but there's a lot to be said for a very happy one that just lets you get on with it.","You cannot predict literary success; the only way you can possibly aim for it is to do your thing and do it well.","I've been writing full-time since I was 23.","For all that being a parent is normal statistically, it's not normal psychologically. It produces some of the most extreme emotions you'll ever have.","Every parent has those moments where they look at their child and think, 'There's a demon in those eyes and no one can see it but me!'","Writers should be applauded for their ability to make things up.","There's no neutral language about travel. Either travel is described in ways that make it sound kind of shallow or just glossy or silly or a way for rich people to spend their time; or else travel is often described in quite derogatory ways, you know, like immigrants swarming across borders, for instance.","A memoir is always the most authentic telling of a situation, but a novel gets to different places.","You know the way there are two kinds of actors - the De Niro kind who's always De Niro, and then somebody like Daniel Day-Lewis, who transforms himself eerily? Well, I aim to be the Daniel Day-Lewis kind of writer. I don't have a house style.","I remember a period where my publisher said to me, 'Look, your historical work is selling much better than your contemporary work, so please give us more historicals.'","I would say I have sort of a natural gift for character, and following one person's point of view at a time, and dialogue, but I'm not naturally good at strong plot.","I'm named after Jane Austen's Emma, and I've always been able to relate to her. She's strong, confident but quite tactless.","It's painful to consider anything but writing.","I'm not at all snobby about book prizes and how they pollute the world of literature. Just like with the Olympics, a little bit of competition gets people truly engrossed in the business of literature.","Any parent knows how to be the ideal parent.","You know, plenty of people headed off to Canada or America on the basis of government information, propaganda campaigns. Often you'd go off with a brochure in hand and you'd turn up and it wouldn't be like that at all.","The great thing about a short story is that it doesn't have to trawl through someone's whole life; it can come in glancingly from the side.","I'm really not one of these procrastinators who cleans the house in order to put off writing, but life gets in the way.","I am clumsy, a late and nervous driver, and despise all sports except a little gentle dancing or yoga.","I have never been depressed or thrown a plate, which I attribute to the cathartic effects of writing books about people whose lives are more grueling than mine.","I hate desks; they make me feel like a child doing homework.","I read three books a week.","I got in the habit of giving away a book as soon as I've finished it because I lived in a housing co-op at Cambridge and had no space to keep books.","I love it when novels contain a broad cast of characters, including queer ones.","Identity politics are wearisome; you don't want to go on speaking for any one group as a writer."],"Emma Dumont":["I was on a TV show about dancers for two and a half seasons called 'Bunheads' on ABC Family, and that was really fun for me because I'm a dancer in a real life.","I did an episode of a show called 'Mind Games,' which is no longer on the air, and it was an intellectual comedy-drama. It was just really smart TV.","I definitely am the sort of person that likes to be constantly learning things."],"Emma Forrest":["The problem with writing a book about bulimia is that whenever you go to the washroom, people think you're throwing up.","The truth is I have had, for whatever reason, several movie-star boyfriends.","When I was old enough to know better, I ate a bar of soap in the shape of the Muppets' Fozzie Bear, because I loved him so much I wanted to consume him, even if doing so made me ill. I didn't yet know the word 'foreshadowing.' Fozzie was the only first of many pop-culture icons I feel shaped by.","New York is the first place I have ever felt safe.","I used to devour biographies of people like Natalie Wood and Marilyn.","I'm not rich, though everybody thinks I am.","There's so much guilt there attached to having a perfectly good life."],"Emma Goldman":["I'd rather have roses on my table than diamonds on my neck.","If voting changed anything, they'd make it illegal.","The most violent element in society is ignorance.","If I can't dance, I don't want to be part of your revolution.","If love does not know how to give and take without restrictions, it is not love, but a transaction that never fails to lay stress on a plus and a minus.","The higher mental development of woman, the less possible it is for her to meet a congenial male who will see in her, not only sex, but also the human being, the friend, the comrade and strong individuality, who cannot and ought not lose a single trait of her character.","The demand for equal rights in every vocation of life is just and fair; but, after all, the most vital right is the right to love and be loved.","No one has yet realized the wealth of sympathy, the kindness and generosity hidden in the soul of a child. The effort of every true education should be to unlock that treasure.","Before we can forgive one another, we have to understand one another.","The motto should not be: Forgive one another; rather understand one another.","No real social change has ever been brought about without a revolution... revolution is but thought carried into action.","The ultimate end of all revolutionary social change is to establish the sanctity of human life, the dignity of man, the right of every human being to liberty and well-being.","No great idea in its beginning can ever be within the law. How can it be within the law? The law is stationary. The law is fixed. The law is a chariot wheel which binds us all regardless of conditions or place or time.","Idealists foolish enough to throw caution to the winds have advanced mankind and have enriched the world.","The history of progress is written in the blood of men and women who have dared to espouse an unpopular cause, as, for instance, the black man's right to his body, or woman's right to her soul.","Free love? as if love is anything but free. Man has bought brains, but all the millions in the world have failed to buy love.","The political arena leaves one no alternative, one must either be a dunce or a rogue.","To the indefinite, uncertain mind of the American radical the most contradictory ideas and methods are possible. The result is a sad chaos in the radical movement, a sort of intellectual hash, which has neither taste nor character.","Merely external emancipation has made of the modern woman an artificial being. Now, woman is confronted with the necessity of emancipating herself from emancipation, if she really desires to be free.","When we can't dream any longer we die.","Heaven must be an awfully dull place if the poor in spirit live there.","Morality and its victim, the mother - what a terrible picture! Is there indeed anything more terrible, more criminal, than our glorified sacred function of motherhood?","Anarchism is the great liberator of man from the phantoms that have held him captive; it is the arbiter and pacifier of the two forces for individual and social harmony.","Every daring attempt to make a great change in existing conditions, every lofty vision of new possibilities for the human race, has been labeled Utopian.","The State is the altar of political freedom and, like the religious altar, it is maintained for the purpose of human sacrifice.","Prostitution, although hounded, imprisoned, and chained, is nevertheless the greatest triumph of Puritanism.","On rare occasions one does hear of a miraculous case of a married couple falling in love after marriage, but on close examination it will be found that it is a mere adjustment to the inevitable.","Only when human sorrows are turned into a toy with glaring colors will baby people become interested - for a while at least. The people are a very fickle baby that must have new toys every day.","Someone has said that it requires less mental effort to condemn than to think.","The most unpardonable sin in society is independence of thought.","Crime is naught but misdirected energy.","Since every effort in our educational life seems to be directed toward making of the child a being foreign to itself, it must of necessity produce individuals foreign to one another, and in everlasting antagonism with each other.","Women need not always keep their mouths shut and their wombs open.","One cannot be too extreme in dealing with social ills; the extreme thing is generally the true thing.","There is no hope even that woman, with her right to vote, will ever purify politics.","Direct action is the logical, consistent method of Anarchism.","Idealists are foolish enough to throw caution to the winds. They have advanced mankind and have enriched the world.","Politics is the reflex of the business and industrial world.","In the true sense one's native land, with its background of tradition, early impressions, reminiscences and other things dear to one, is not enough to make sensitive human beings feel at home.","It is essential that we realize once and for all that man is much more of a sex creature than a moral creature. The former is inherent, the other is grafted on.","Woman, essentially a purist, is naturally bigoted and relentless in her effort to make others as good as she thinks they ought to be.","To the moralist prostitution does not consist so much in the fact that the woman sells her body, but rather that she sells it out of wedlock.","All claims of education notwithstanding, the pupil will accept only that which his mind craves.","Puritanism, in whatever expression, is a poisonous germ. On the surface everything may look strong and vigorous; yet the poison works its way persistently, until the entire fabric is doomed.","The individual whose vision encompasses the whole world often feels nowhere so hedged in and out of touch with his surroundings as in his native land."],"Emma Holly":["I did have a nice career in print, but traditional publishers don't always have the resources to create individualized marketing for their authors. Mine never figured out how to package books as hot as mine so that they found their full audience. Finally, I got frustrated enough over my lack of traction to walk away.","Even though I wasn't sure I could make it as an indie, almost immediately I felt as if a weight had been lifted off me. To be as independent as I am and to be able to support myself is incredibly satisfying. Everything I want to do myself, I can.","Alpha heroes, even uberalpha heroes, still win readers' hearts. I like a masterful hero myself, but I also enjoy the idea that sometimes the heroine can be in charge.","I have two much-beloved stovetop espresso pots at home, plus a couple French presses I couldn't resist buying because they were so pretty. If I had to imbibe at Starbucks, I'd want a mocha with an extra shot."],"Emma Ishta":["My computer background is a black and white picture I took of the Niteroi Contemporary Art Museum in Brazil.","All I can say is thank God my stepdaughter's favourite band in the whole wide world is The Beatles. We do have dance parties to 'Wannabe' though.","My last name is actually my middle name. Gotcha!","I'm such a huge advocate for strong, intelligent representation of women in the media.","There's nothing wrong with being a little unusual.","To be honest, the piece of clothing from a man's wardrobe I wear most often, to bed and around the house, is my boyfriend's underwear. I think it's infinitely unfair that women are compelled to wear underwear with a comfort factor of zero whilst men stroll around in essentially the most comfortable item of clothing ever made.","I like men who style themselves so that I can tell they give a damn about how they present themselves, but not too much as to say that's probably what they care about most.","Spare me the carefully thought out accessorising that is supposed to look casually thrown on, while in actuality, hours have been spent on the picking and choosing of said jewellery, scarves, etc. Unless you are Keith Richards and can absolutely pull it off, less is more.","I used to have a hat obsession, but unfortunately for me, I have a tiny head, which means most hats don't fit very well. I do love them, though.","I absolutely love working in Australia. Overseas is a lot tougher - it's really hard to break into campaigns over there."],"Emma Lazarus":["I am perfectly conscious that this contempt and hatred underlies the general tone of the community towards us, and yet when I even remotely hint at the fact that we are not a favorite people I am accused of stirring up strife and setting barriers between the two sects.","Until we are all free, we are none of us free.","Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.","My own curiosity and interest are insatiable.","Jews are the intensive form of any nationality whose language and customs they adopt.","The particular article ought in my opinion to be treated with absolute contempt. It is too vile to touch.","I am never going to write for the sake of writing."],"Emma McLaughlin":["For a blink of an eye, there was so much media glare. It was unexpected, and I don't think we realized the magnitude of the message we were imparting with 'The Nanny Diaries.' There was also this added challenge that some of the media power players whose publications were doing stories on us perceived us to be sniping at their lifestyles.","The more Mommy blogs going nuclear over playground etiquette I read and birthday parties of glazed adults munching cupcakes like demoralized zombies I attend, I realize this is what my friends who conceived before me meant by, 'You just won't care.'","Between finishing emails, loading the fridge, unloading the dishwasher, getting our son to eat his chicken nuggets and my dog to swallow her pill, it takes approximately 32 days for my husband and I to complete a discussion and 46 to wrap up a fight.","A Hallmark card with paragraphs about my beauty written by a stranger is vaguely depressing.","Valentine's Day: Rubbing singles' noses in their lack of a mate and the noses of couples in their lack of time.","Studios will tell you that they can't turn a profit on female-driven entertainment. Which is like the Gap saying no one is buying clothes anymore. No. No one is buying your clothes.","We 'chicks' have munched our popcorn while romantic comedies became just comedies, and then each female protagonist got recast for Matthew McConaughey or Seth Rogan.","My writing partner, Nicki, and I became obsessed with a monologist who performs unscripted shows equipped with nothing more than scribbled bullet points and a glass of water. We wrote him a fan letter and found ourselves sharing lunch and eventually a friendship.","As a rule, I try to steer clear of opinions pertaining to your parenting. I assume you're doing the best you can, and God bless.","I think something that really shocked me as a nanny were parents who sort of assumed the worst from the get-go. People who didn't accept the benefit of the doubt.","I think just because you're a mom, it doesn't negate - if anything, you're probably more enhanced - that you're a woman trying to find your place in the world.","If I could give a shout-out to anything in the childhood world, I have to say 'Daniel Tiger.' I want to write a love letter to everyone on that staff. It is so perfectly, thoughtfully, lovingly done. And as a parent, it is the one thing out of everything that we dip in to that really helps.","We really set out in all our books to say something. Every one is an effort to bring the reader over and show them our theory as to why what we're talking about needs to be talked about.","It's funny, we started writing chick-lit when it was just becoming a crowded marketplace, and now the same thing is happening with YA. It really used to just be one shelf at the library - Nancy Drew and Judy Blume.","Read at a time when everything feels intense, seminal, and like you're the first person to discover it, freshman year of college, Carol Gilligan's 'In a Different Voice' made my hair stand on end with awe.","Before novels written by women were relegated to their own 'genre,' I was introduced to Jane Smiley by a dear professor who raised my awareness of what female authors were bringing to the table of contemporary fiction.","Cameron Crowe can write dialogue and shoot it with warmth and humor like nobody else.","I can't listen to anything when I write, not even the TV. I do have to listen to music when I drive, though."],"Emma Orczy":["A surging, seething, murmuring crowd of beings that are human only in name, for to the eye and ear they seem naught but savage creatures, animated by vile passions and by the lust of vengeance and of hate.","We seek him here, we seek him there, Those Frenchies seek him everywhere. Is he in heaven? - Is he in hell? That damned, elusive Pimpernel?"],"Emma Rigby":["I love gritty drama. I'm passionate about films and drama that make you think - hard-hitting, gravelly characters.","When you're in a soap, it's fantastic, and I'm really grateful for the fans who watch you and support you. For me, it was the best experience because I was able to act every day and work with so many different directors and get some great storylines and learn on-screen.","I've been on 'Hollyoaks' since I was 15, and I've grown up on the show. I'm so very fortunate to be given the opportunity to learn my craft in such a fantastic environment.","I did really well at school, and I would have loved to have gone to Oxford or Cambridge. I would have read English, and I'm really interested in politics.","I've always been a performer. I love doing impressions of people and being the clown.","My mum took me to the ballet at three, and that was the only time I sat still, with jaw open, mesmerised. She brought me home, and I wouldn't stop dancing."],"Emma Roberts":["I'm surrounded by great friends and family. I don't know what I would do without them.","I love dressing up. It's the best part of being a girl, I think.","I want to constantly be surprising people with different roles.","I'm obsessed with sushi.","If there wasn't mystery, people wouldn't have anything to ponder. If you already knew everything, you wouldn't have anything to think about and life would just be really boring.","If I'm having a really bad day, I always have a girlfriend - or even a guy friend - who I can call. They'll listen to me wallow for a minute and then be like, 'Okay, let's stop. Everything's great. Let's figure out how to fix whatever's bothering you.'","I grew up with just my mom. She and I were like best friends. She's a very independent woman and I admire that about her. In my life, I've tried to be like that. To be okay with being on my own and being independent.","I just never have really been the kind of person that's out in public being inappropriate, I guess. I like to have fun as much as the next person but I tend to do it in private and just hang out with close friends. If I'm going to go out, I'll just do it with my really good friends.","Well, there's nothing more touching than putting a smile on a kid's face when you can.","I love to just work with new people in general. It's always really fun.","You don't realize how hard it is to live on your own. But there's no mom to do your laundry, and make you dinner and to do things for you, and you don't think about little things like buying paper towels and salt.","I'm my own person, and am trying to carve out a career on my own.","I'm very outgoing and social.","I don't think I'd be a very good talk show host. I mean, I'm very talkative but I don't know if I could do that all the time.","When I was homeschooled, I fell so behind - months behind at school - because I'm not good at keeping up. And so I had to sit down for literally three weeks to a month and just do all of it. And it was not fun, and I didn't want to do it, but I had to.","I think once you're in the friend zone, I'm not sure how you get out. Well, actually, I do know how you get out. You act like the friend back. That's how you get out.","You can't trust actors.","I'm scared of scary movies.","I've only been to high school on TV and in movies. I've never actually been to high school.","I think it's important to have as many experiences as possible in life because one day you won't be able to do it anymore.","I love dark chocolate. I love it.","I love summer, but my legs are so pale I can never wear shorts or a bikini.","I'm really inspired by British style, like Kate Moss and Sienna Miller.","I think as you get older, you tend to think of teenagers as really young.","I read a book a week. I try to keep my mind working.","Jennifer Aniston is a genius.","I'm obsessed with Nicholas Sparks. I've literally read every single book, because every time I travel, at the airport, I always buy a new Nicholas Sparks book.","I'm a really picky eater.","I don't like vegetables and most fruit.","I only like food without color, like potatoes, bread, and pasta.","For me, when I read a book, I'm very much about detail.","I loved being on set when I was younger.","I've always wanted to get into acting, ever since I was younger. I'd put on shows for my family and run around play dress-up all the time. I think I was 4 when I told them I wanted to do movies.","It's always great when a director is just supportive of what you're doing. They're not so much critiquing you but giving you more ideas, giving you tons of things to work with, making you question your character and making you think about it... and making it seem like everything is limitless. That usually helps a lot.","I'd love to maybe try writing. I don't know if I'd publish anything, but as a hobby, it's really nice. I bought a typewriter, and I really like to write on the typewriter sometimes. It's a fun little hobby.","It's funny, having the same name as someone. Me, Emma Watson and Emma Stone, the amount of times I've been called Emma Watson or Emma Stone is so funny. It's just 'cause we're all named Emma. None of us look alike.","I'd love to do a comedy like 'Bridesmaids;' I think that would be so fun. I would play the Kristen Wiig character.","I'm obsessed with heels.","I love vintage shopping, I think it's really fun. And I love the feeling of finding the most amazing piece for less.","Because I'm very petite, I try not to wear things that have a heavy pattern because I feel like they overtake you.","I think it's important to not always wear pants and not always wear dresses. You should and mix that up.","New York is a fun place to shoot, but it's definitely hectic.","Sometimes when I'm going to sleep, I think, 'Oh God, my future husband is out there somewhere and I might know him, or I might not, and I wonder what he's doing and I wonder if he knows me.' I just always think that's so fascinating, that even when you were two years old, your future husband was out there somewhere.","I like to go to parties if I know who's going to be there, and if it's people I want to be with. I don't just go to go. And I always drive myself, because I hate being stuck places - there's nothing worse that going out and then being stuck!","I never ask boys' opinions on clothes, ever. I really think, unless you think the guy has style, don't ask. So I only ask my girl friends. I don't trust guys' opinions on style!","I'm impatient.","I read all the books for 'Twilight.'","I don't really have a type of guy I like. It's just like nice guys, cute boys I mean, ones that are funny.","I just feel like with independent movies... they're really free to do whatever they want. They're not afraid to make a statement about anything, and there's not a huge studio behind them making sure that everything is wholesome and politically correct and all that.","I really like Gwyneth Paltrow a lot, as far as her career, because I think she's done a lot of small movies but she's also done great, big movies, and she's a really great actress.","What is Twitter?! I don't know what Twitter is! Everyone keeps inviting me to Twitter and everyone's going on about twittering and tweeting and this whole thing, and I just don't understand it.","Studio films are really fun. You have months and months to shoot. With the smaller films you get to be on a much more intimate set and have to get things done quickly.","I love doing kind of more kiddish-oriented movies, but I also love doing adult things. And I think it's fun to do a mix.","I just don't like talking about my relationships or anything like that, in any reference.","I think I'm relatable.","I am definitely not like the hottest young actress, the most beautiful or whatever. I have my own thing going.","I would like to be recognized for my style, because I love clothes.","There's not a lot of original ways to get attention in the press.","Being in the business and growing up in L.A., I think I turned out pretty OK.","When I'm not working, I don't do lots of glamorous things.","My favorite book is 'The Perks of Being a Wallflower' by Stephen Chbosky.","I have really crooked teeth - they give me character!","We Robertses have too many teeth for our mouths.","I would love to study photography.","I'm 5 foot 2. I wish I were 5' 6. Everyone who meets me says, 'Oh my God. You look so much taller in person.'","London is my favorite place in the world. I love London. I think it has the best of L.A. and New York in one, and I have a really great friend there.","I'm a huge Wes Anderson fan; I would faint if I met him, let alone got to work with him.","Stuffing is my favorite food in the world! I actually have been known to go buy stuffing and make it in the middle of summer.","I'd love to work with Rachel McAdams, because she's a great actress.","I would die if Woody Allen ever called and said, 'Emma, I have a role for you.'"],"Emma Stone":["Just because I don't have a college degree doesn't mean I am not smart!","I just live my life how I live as a person. I certainly am not, like, a saint or an angel by any means. I'm not anything like that. But I live just how I live. I mean, I have a little paranoia, but that's about it.","So anyway, I've learned a lot about myself just in terms of acting but just work ethic and interesting things like full-page monologues or talking straight into camera, which I had never gotten to do before.","The end of 'City Lights' makes me cry every time I see it - when Charlie Chaplin walks by the shop window and the once-blind girl brings him a flower and pins it to his lapel.","You know how sports teach kids teamwork and how to be strong and brave and confident? Improv was my sport. I learned how to not waffle and how to hold a conversation, how to take risks and actually be excited to fail.","I think the number one thing that I find important is the importance of honesty with your friends and your parents, if you can be. But I think that telling people how you really feel, being who you truly are, being safe and taking care of yourself is the most important thing.","I was a good-looking kid. I never felt, like, dorky. I was just like, 'Yup, these are my braces. I've had them forever.'","I really like grammar. And spelling. I was a spelling-bee kid. I'm hard-core about grammar.","When I look back, I don't have regrets. In the moment I am really, really hard on myself, I'm definitely my own worst critic and can be my own worst enemy, and I'm trying very hard not to be that.","I think women should wear whatever makeup they want for themselves. Makeup should be fun.","I had massive anxiety as a child. I was in therapy. From 8 to 10, I was borderline agora-phobic. I could not leave my mom's side. I don't really have panic attacks anymore, but I had really bad anxiety.","My favorite thing about movies is the ending, and so all my favorite movies have really great endings.","My parents are both very funny but they're also relatively soft-spoken, normal human beings while I'm just a lunatic. I don't know where this loud, ballsy, hammy ridiculousness came from. I'm just glad I followed my goals and my parents did too. It's not like we even had a plan when I dragged my mom to Los Angeles.","Comedy was my sport. It taught me how to roll with the punches. Failure is the exact same as success when it comes to comedy because it just keeps coming. It never stops.","Drama is hard for me. Crying is much harder for me than laughter.","I think there are plenty of soulmates out there. That's what I choose to believe.","So one day, in a fit of trying to do something different, I just dyed my hair dark brown and got my first role a week later, after which I thought: 'People are closed-minded, man! Like a different hair colour changes everything!'","When I was 14 -years-old, I made this PowerPoint presentation, and I invited my parents into my room and gave them popcorn. It was called 'Project Hollywood 2004' and it worked. I moved to L.A. in January of 2004.","I love improv. 'Crazy, Stupid, Love,' the script was really great, but the directors were open to letting you try different things. And that felt like a muscle I hadn't exercised in a really long time.","I was just a ham since about the age of five. If I was performing at Medieval Times or something, I'd be the court jester. That was always my defense mechanism. I was never all that funny; I was just obnoxious and loud.","I always loved acting and improv and sketch comedy and theater, which I did at a local youth theater.","I'm a huge music fan. I usually say that if I had been born with a musical inclination, it would've been great. The Beatles changed everything for me, and I wanted to be a journalist for 'Rolling Stone.' I'm a big music fan in a Cameron Crowe way, kind of in a spectator way.","I mean, I haven't been around very long. I can't expect everyone to have seen 'The House Bunny'. Oh God. I am having such waves of internal embarrassment, which now I'm admitting on a tape recorder. This is so one of the things I should keep in my head.","I like to look like a person. It drives me crazy when you see women in movies playing teachers, and they have biceps. It totally takes me out of the movie. I start thinking, Wow, that actress playing this part really looks great!","I used to do Facebook but you get a little too wrapped up in that stuff. Its more distracting than anything so I don't any more. I left it behind. I detoxed!","I'm actually the last person to ask about school. I kinda ducked out at 12, before all that stuff might have happened. I left school after sixth grade and was basically home-schooled after that.","I think 'Saturday Night Live', starting in the 1970s, really gave women an outlet to be funny. A lot of those women went on to have film careers, from Kristen Wiig now to Tina Fey and Gilda Radner.","He's my favorite! He wrote and produced, and starred in and cast all of his movies! Can you imagine? I get really excited when I talk about Charlie Chaplin.","It's definitely a shock to go from being 15 in high school to working. There's no real cushion there. There's no preparation at all. You learn by doing.","Arizona is the worst place to spend the summer - it's like 125 degrees - so my mom, my brother and I would go to the beach for two months to escape the heat.","A lot of times, I feel like people come up to me because they think I'm like my character in 'Easy A', or because they've seen me in interviews, but really what they're a fan of is a movie or a character.","In general, I get nervous when I do print interviews because I know that whatever I say is going to be shown through the lens of whomever I'm talking to.","I've read a lot of different versions of myself - and all of them are true because it's all opinion, and they're as accurate as it can ever be. But I don't think that I've been deft at hiding parts of my personality.","I'm not one of those shoppers where I go to a store and I'm like, trying it on, I'm not sure, 'Oh, can you put this on hold?' No. It's either love it or hate it. And it's the same way with scripts. I usually know within the first 10 pages. If I don't latch into it by then, then it's not going to happen.","I've never played someone where I felt it was beneficial to build from the outside in.","I have a friend who says that roles choose you at the time that you need them most, and you have to believe, as an actor, if you didn't get a part that you really, really wanted, and it went to someone else, it was because it was theirs to begin with.","The roles that have come into my life have taught me - and in that time period maybe I didn't even know it, but whatever came up or whatever it is that you have to express at that time, has benefitted me in a particular way.","My stylist has really great taste - Petra Flannery has really great taste. I mean, I am opinionated, and as time goes on, as I've gotten to see more dresses or more clothes, it's easier to say, 'I like that' or 'I don't like that,' but it's nothing I would ever, you know, design.","My life is PG-13 sometimes, and I really want Josh Grogan to propose to me, and he just won't do it.","I'm not very computer savvy.","If I feel strongly about anything, I get overwhelmed with emotion.","I was very lucky with the parents I was blessed with. I don't think it could have worked out any better. They've always been so understanding of me and understanding of what I want to do.","I'd like to produce. I'd like to come up with ideas and collaborate with people and directors and writers that I like, be a part of movies that have the same idea that the movies that impacted me have. I'd like to be able to do that for people.","I just like to keep working and being able to pay my bills.","There's so much I'm interested in that I didn't discover in high school. For 'The Amazing Spider-Man', because Gwen is a scientist, we went to a lab in San Diego, and we were learning about biology. And I'm fascinated! Because I never went to biology class in high school.","Often, joking for me is a way of diffusing the awkwardness of a situation, so it's kind of exhilarating to be a part of projects where there's nothing funny or lighthearted.","At first, when you go to premieres and award shows, you're thinking, 'How the hell am I here? All these people I've never met are here, and it's so cool!' And then, as time goes on, it's a little bit like, 'Ah... it's more like work.'","Comedy's my first love. I love that so much. You play comedy in drama, too. The difference between genres doesn't really change the method of acting.","The only movie I can watch on a loop, over and over, is 'Help', the Beatles movie. It's so funny and irreverent and great.","I used to spray tan a lot when I was a teenager. The last time I got spray-tanned was for the Golden Globes. And I was like, 'I love spray-tanning so much.' I still really like it. But it definitely makes me look like I have leprosy, after a point.","You won't hear me saying I have no body issues because I wouldn't be human if I didn't.","Running is bad for your knees, and I like to do things I actually enjoy, like going for a swim.","Yes, you should be healthy and take care of yourself, but growing up, I've seen people who have horrible issues with food.","I had a trainer during 'Spiderman,' and I discovered I have deep-seated rage when I'm holding heavy weights over my head. Whatever dormant anger I have in me, that's where it comes out. That's not the kind of working out I want to do.","I'm shockingly terrible at action movies.","I was raised in Arizona, and I went to public school, and the extent of my knowledge of the civil-rights movement was the story of Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King, Jr. I wonder how much my generation knows.","The last thing in the world my parents would want to do is get on a stage or do a movie. They would probably rather die. But they let me be who I was, and they supported me."],"Emma Tennant":["Because I am really interested in gardening, I do really interesting plants, not even always flowers. And because I have grown them, I really know them like friends. I paint everything from exotic orchids to rosehips growing wild in a hedge. They just have to speak to me.","I didn't go to university; I hardly went to school, but I grew up among people well versed in Henry James and Proust, and just felt this endless, total inadequacy.","When my father died in Greece, leaving my mother strapped, a cheque arrived next day from my Greek publishers who'd just bought two of my books for pounds 500.","The fascination of somebody with original creative gifts is something that's always drawn me. I get attached to them, but I can't call it being in love, because the words are so debased.","My life has really been about writing, though some think it's all about once having been in a ball dress and having an odd life and marrying all the time. But it's the writing that's always been the point.","Like all women, I've had a pretty awful time in many ways, but it's always possible to either make a joke or find someone else.","Quite a lot of people wanted me to write about my family, I suppose for fairly obvious reasons, and there was always something that would stop me, I thought they were asking me for the wrong motives.","I cannot remember a time when I was not interested in both gardening and painting. I must have been born with a trowel in one hand and a paintbrush in the other."],"Emma Thomas":["The great thing about a trilogy is that it feels like you've got a beginning, a middle, and an end.","Twitter wasn't a big thing even on 'Inception;' it certainly wasn't on 'The Dark Knight.'","We've spent almost ten years of our lives making 'Batman' films."],"Emma Thompson":["You can't imagine what satisfaction can be gotten from throwing a pie into someone's face.","This morning, I went to wipe my hands on a tea towel, and while I was using it, it seemed like it felt a bit light. I unfolded it and realized my daughter had cut little bits out of it to make frocks for her dolls!","I don't mean being famous is a perk, because one knows that it's not necessarily a perk, but there are certain perks to being well-known and respected in one's field. Public perks. Like, I don't know, general friendliness and willingness to please, just to point out two.","It's not my fault that there is this gap between rich and poor, it is the fault of governments. I want a different world. One where I don't wake up thinking I'm so lucky to be able to feed my daughter.","If you don't want women to do whatever they need to do then you must provide them with food, you must provide them with shelter and their basic human rights.","Any problem, big or small, within a family, always seems to start with bad communication. Someone isn't listening.","Its unfortunate and I really wish I wouldn't have to say this, but I really like human beings who have suffered. They're kinder.","I do think that despite my best efforts to resist it, I am now a grown-up. It's due to lots of very difficult decisions that you make over a long period of time - about motherhood, wifehood, and work, and all the things that one has to make decisions about.","I don't think people understand that being poor means you have to work from dawn until dusk just to survive through the day. I think there's some notion that poor people lie about all day not doing anything.","A lot of very beautiful women can be a pain because all they're thinking about is how they look.","My appearance has changed a lot over the years, but it has far more to do with how I feel about being a woman.","Maybe I don't take myself so seriously any more. And I don't care how I'm judged. I'm past all that.","If you've got to my age, you've probably had your heart broken many times. So it's not that difficult to unpack a bit of grief from some little corner of your heart and cry over it.","I have a nervous breakdown in the film and in one scene I get to stand at the top of the stairs waving an empty sherry bottle which is, of course, a typical scene from my daily life, so isn't much of a stretch.","Sometimes you'll have some things, and sometimes you'll have other things. And you do not need it all at once; it's not good for you.","My worst quality is impatience.","I've a problem with the word charity because I think that NGOs, as I prefer calling them, really do take the work of moral and social responsibilities that ought to be taken on by governments.","We need men and women to sit down and talk to each other about sex honestly and openly. That would help us fight Aids so immediately. But our lack of communication is hugely problematic.","There is that thing about not working with animals and children - I don't think that's true. Although you should never work with donkeys.","A lot of people in my world - in the acting world - have either lost friends to Aids or live with HIV because its origin in our culture, in New York for instance, was in the gay community.","And it's absolutely true that male sexual behaviour and female responses to male demands change a lot when they start communicating - and the levels of the communication that I've seen on the ground in very, very poor areas are so high and I think why don't we have that here?","But when I lose my temper, I find it difficult to forgive myself. I feel I've failed. I can be calm in a crisis, in the face of death or things that hurt badly. I don't get hysterical, which may be masochistic of me.","Children are the most wonderful audiences. What's struck me most is that that they watch it so silently, until the end when they shriek and shout and clap.","Children don't need much advice but they really do need to be listened to and not just with half an ear.","I don't have technique because I never learnt any.","I hate the way market forces try to separate us out in to the appropriate demographic - basically in order to sell us things. We need to find stories that we can enjoy together, not separately.","I have had lots of friends who've been affected by Aids and a very good friend of mine, Oscar Moore, died of Aids and I was with him in his last year quite a bit. And of course he was a man living in a very rich culture with a wealthy family who was able to afford health care.","I think that my work is my attempt, I suppose, is to try and become a piece of connective tissue. I'm trying to communicate with people here and in America - in rich countries - about what I see on the ground in badly affected areas.","I think the point about ActionAid is what it's asking people to do is engage with poor people in developing countries and understand what their lives are like and understand how the way we live our lives impacts on theirs.","Indeed - judicious, consistent parenting is a dream of mine. No judgements, learning space and listening carefully are my goals.","It is remarkable how many misconceptions there are here about life in the developing world and I think that that knowledge gap has done a lot to contribute to the imbalance quite frankly.","Tell him I mind having to look pretty, that's what I mind, because it is so much more of an effort.","The fact is that young people are going to have sex whether you like it or not.","The trouble is it's very difficult to pin-point the most important thing because Aids affects everyone in different levels of society, differently and you have to respond to it differently.","We belabour, I think, under a very heavy crust of consumerism really.","What was important was trying to create something that families could watch together and enjoy together.","I was brought up by very witty people who were dealing with quite difficult things: disease and death... I was brought up by people who tended to giggle at funerals.","Sometimes I get to put on posh frocks and be Madam Glamour, the vendor of my wares. My lovely friend Kath, a stylist, puts me into things I'd never dream of. But my real life is very different. It's very, very home-based - an intense domestic life, that's the core of everything.","London has always been a haven for victims of cruelty, and been improved by them. Yet I can see it changing now. Outsiders are demonised, there are little bits of legislation, people are scared.","I understand what it's like to come with your family, and to uproot yourself and come to another culture. You need a lot of support. People say, 'She's got her daughter; she's got her husband.' Yeah, but she hasn't got anyone else.","One is a child when one has a child. No one says, 'You will never be the same again.' Which is the truth! And we're all supposed to be happy all the time. What is that about?","When husbands and fathers leave, their wives and daughters tend to value themselves less as a result.","My mother has never approved of high heels. As a result, I have never been able to walk in high heels - and they were all I ever wanted. So of course, my daughter has two pairs.","The thing that influenced me most in relation to 'Nanny McPhee' were the Westerns I watched with my father. All the Spaghetti Westerns; all the Virginians; all the High Chaparrals. Because if you think about the form, it's a stranger from out of town.","I have to write for everyone. What really fascinates me is how you make films or make stories that can genuinely be shared by different groups.","If you're actually allowing your creative part to control your writing rather than a more commercial instinct or motive, then you'll find that all sorts of interesting things will bubble up to the surface.","During an election, it's like they're doing my job: they're going around banging the drum for their party and selling their movie. You know, it's the same thing.","We've got people looking at our seamy side and our sad side a lot of the time because that's easier. It's much more difficult to make a film about happiness with lots of jokes in it.","Film is so much to do with perfection and how differently you can feel about someone at the beginning of the film and the end of the film.","British aren't really known for their physical loveliness but firemen, generally speaking, are gorgeous.","You can't be a great mum and work the whole time necessarily; those two things aren't ideal. We have an awful lot to work on and to debate about in relation to our working lives, because it isn't working for a lot of people, particularly for a lot of women.","The only way you can have it all is by delegating all the running of the home to other people - which I don't ever want to do... So you do it yourself, and it takes time and energy and effort. And if you give it the time, it's profoundly enjoyable."],"Emma Watson":["I don't want other people to decide who I am. I want to decide that for myself.","My idea of sexy is that less is more. The less you reveal the more people can wonder.","Ignoring fame was my rebellion, in a funny way. I was insistent on being normal and doing normal things. It probably wasn't advisable to go to college in America and room with a complete stranger. And it probably wasn't wise to share a bathroom with eight other people in a coed dorm. Looking back, that was crazy.","When I started dating I had this kind of Romeo and Juliet, fateful romantic idea about love which was almost that you were a victim and there was a lot of pain involved and that was how it should be.","It sounds like a cliche but I also learnt that you're not going to fall for the right person until you really love yourself and feel good about how you are.","I don't want the fear of failure to stop me from doing what I really care about.","All I can do is follow my instincts, because I'll never please everyone.","It's quite stressful knowing that every time you walk out the door, someone is going to be giving you a very good look up and down, judging everything you wear.","I'm going to do what I want to do. I'm going to be who I really am. I'm going to figure out what that is.","I have to really enjoy the good things because it makes the bad things OK.","I don't have makeup on all the time, but when I want, I have fun with my friends choosing clothes and putting nail polish on.","I guess what really forms you as a person is what you do within your family to receive love or attention. In my family, what you had to do to receive attention was to have good conversation at the dinner table or for me to do well at school, and those were really my focuses because that was what was valued the most.","Acting never was about the money for me... Maybe in 10 years, I'll be able to appreciate the fact that I am financially stable and independent and I don't have to make bad choices. I can be very picky.","It's almost like the better I do, the more my feeling of inadequacy actually increases, because I'm just going, 'Any moment, someone's going to find out I'm a total fraud, and that I don't deserve any of what I've achieved. I can't possibly live up to what everyone thinks I am and what everyone's expectations of me are.'","It sounds so geeky, but I really do like studying and reading, and if I'm not working on 'Harry Potter,' then my greatest relaxation is to sit with a book.","Being an actress, I find myself people-watching and I can be quite shy.","I've always been like that; I give 100 percent. I can't do it any other way.","Make-up is actually something I've always really loved.","When I haven't been working I've tried to travel a lot.","I find the whole concept of being 'sexy' embarrassing and confusing. If I do a photo-shoot, people desperately want to change me - dye my hair blonder, pluck my eyebrows, give me a fringe. Then there's the choice of clothes. I know everyone wants a picture of me in a mini-skirt. But that's not me.","I could be 100 years old and in my rocker, but I'll still be very proud that I was part of the 'Harry Potter' films.","The difficulty for me is that I'm interested in so many different things. I could never really imagine myself doing one thing, and I'm pretty sure that I'll end up doing four or five different things.","But sometimes I've felt a little constrained by that idea of who I'm meant to be.","I like books that aren't just lovely but that have memories in themselves. Just like playing a song, picking up a book again that has memories can take you back to another place or another time.","I mean, I have done scenes with animals, with owls, with bats, with cats, with special effects, with thespians, in the freezing cold, in the pouring rain, boiling hot; I've done press with every syndication, every country; I've done interviews with people dressed up as cows - there's honestly nothing that's gonna intimidate me!","I don't want other people to decide who I am. I want to decide that for myself. I want to avoid becoming too styled and too 'done' and too generic. You see people as they go through their career, and they just become more and more like everyone else.","I'm not going to school just for the academics - I wanted to share ideas, to be around people who are passionate about learning.","I want to be a Renaissance woman. I want to paint, and I want to write, and I want to act, and I want to just do everything.","I could never really imagine myself doing one thing, and I'm pretty sure that I'll end up doing four or five different things. I want to be a Renaissance woman. I want to paint, and I want to write, and I want to act, and I want to just do everything.","But it's a journey and the sad thing is you only learn from experience, so as much as someone can tell you things, you have to go out there and make your own mistakes in order to learn.","I'm a feminist, but I think that romance has been taken away a bit for my generation. I think what people connect with in novels is this idea of an overpowering, encompassing love - and it being more important and special than anything and everything else.","I have had no control over my life. I have lived in a complete bubble. They found me and picked me for the part. And now I'm desperately trying to find my way through it.","I don't have perfect teeth, I'm not stick thin. I want to be the person who feels great in her body and can say that she loves it and doesn't want to change anything.","If I could wear any label forever it would be Burberry. It covers a huge span of stuff. You can't go wrong with a classic trench and a pair of jeans.","I've probably earned the right to screw up a few times. I don't want the fear of failure to stop me from doing what I really care about.","To be honest, I've always had far too much freedom. I had a job when I was 10. I started living on my own when I was 17 or 18. I've earned my own money; I've traveled the world. What would I rebel against?","I paint and I draw and I write and I do other things too, and recently some people at school were asking if I'd ever publish any of my work. But I almost feel like I would have to publish it under another name because there's a definition of me out there that feels kind of stuck in the moment when it was formed.","Hermione uses all these big long tongue twister words. I don't know what she's going on about half the time!","I feel like a voodoo doll. It's grim. It's gross.","I wasn't one of those girls who always dreamed of being an actress. I went to a normal school and then these film auditioners turned up when I was nine. Then I just fell into this whirlwind.","I was very keen. I was super-eager to please and be good. And I was always kind of bossy.","I just loved performing. It just made me feel alive. It's scary, but that's part of it. I think it's important to have that extra adrenaline. It gives you that extra zing.","Let's be honest, I have enough money to never have to work again.","I just feel like if I start opening the door to talking about my university experience, then people just kind of... own everything. There was a lot of stuff a couple of years ago saying that I was bullied at Brown and awful things like that, none of which were true.","Hermione is so close to who I am as a person that I've never really had to research a role. I'm literally rediscovering what it means to be an actress.","I want to be normal. I really want anonymity.","I just try and surround myself, for the biggest proportion of time that I can, with people who make me feel normal, because constantly feeling abnormal is quite difficult.","I really want to write a novel. I also want to learn to play the mandolin.","It's very hard to describe your own style. And I'm young, so I'm still experimenting. But I think it's quite British and very much about individuality.","I think the actresses who are really successful are the ones who are comfortable in their own skins and still look human.","I love fashion. I think it's so important, because it's how you show yourself to the world.","I used to look back at pictures and cringe but actually I'm quite proud that I've had fun with fashion and don't always look perfect. The only regret I have is when I look at something I wore when I was very young and it obviously looks like it belonged to someone else.","I've always been fascinated by Elizabeth Taylor, and I had read that her first kiss happened on a film set, which actually made me a little sad. You need to have normal experiences of your own.","If I went to somewhere busy, I wouldn't last very long. I can't go to a museum - I'll last 10 or 15 minutes in a museum. The problem is that when one person asks for a photograph, then someone sees a flash goes off, then everyone else sort of... it's sort of like a domino effect.","Yes, I will put it out there - I will work for anyone for free if they're prepared to make their clothing Fair Trade and organic. It's really hard to get people interested in it.","I stole a piece of the chess set on the first film. I took a piece of the treasure out of Bellatrix's vault on this film. And I've taken my wand and I've got my cloak.","I love painting and have a need to do it.","I'm a perfectionist, so my bossiness definitely comes out.","I was working on 'Harry Potter' while I was growing up, and the attention it brought me made me feel quite isolated.","Now, honestly, every movie set that I go on, I walk onto set with the confidence that there is nothing that they can throw at me that's gonna surprise me.","And I always keep cards people send me. I have a whole wall covered with them.","I'm a multidimensional person and that's the freedom of fashion: that you're able to reinvent yourself through how you dress and how you cut your hair or whatever.","I like men with quick wit, good conversation and a great sense of humour. I love banter. I want a man to like me for me - I want him to be authentic.","I do worry about the expectation to look a certain way.","I'm very crafty! One time I made a television set out of a cardboard box - Everybody thought it was a lark! This was the beginning of a love affair with the arts.","As a child, I loved being onstage. I loved singing, I loved the lights, I loved the adrenaline. I even loved learning lines. I was completely obsessive.","I genuinely haven't really had a rebellious phase. I think it's just because of the way I was brought up. I think it's because I left home when I was ten years old.","I'm a very heady person; I'm in my head a lot.","I had a job when I was 10. I started living on my own when I was 17 or 18. I've earned my own money; I've traveled the world. What would I rebel against?","I am literally obsessed with Lena Dunham. She's, like, my favorite person in the world. I follow her on Twitter; I read her every day.","The entertainment industry is pretty nuts, and having had that experience outside of it and going to university has really made a big difference. It's important to me to feel like I have my own life.","I don't consider myself to be a celebrity. I don't fit that mould.","Field hockey is my strongest sport, and if I lose a game, I take a long, hot bath and moan about it.","I've never understood having crushes on people who you don't know in real life.","I think when you take away all, like, the premieres and press stuff and all the special effects, then you just come down to the fact that it's all about acting, and I think that has been the best bit for me.","I really love animals and enjoy working with them.","If anyone else played Hermione, it would actually kill me.","My friends are all really nice about my fame, they're just curious really, they ask lots of questions."],"Emma Willard":["His daughter returned from her boarding school, improved in fashionable airs and expert in manufacturing fashionable toys; but, in her conversation, he sought in vain for that refined and fertile mind which he had fondly expected.","Aware that his disappointment has its source in a defective education, he looks with anxiety on his other daughters, whose minds, like lovely buds, are beginning to open. Where shall he find a genial soil in which he may place them to expand?","In inquiring concerning the benefits of the plan proposed, I shall proceed upon the supposition that female seminaries will be patronized throughout our country."],"Emmanuel Jal":["I am proof that one person can rise above any challenge, and if I can, then so will others if they are given the chance.","Rap music is amazing, it's beautiful. But the problem is the lyrics. The person who writes the lyrics - that's the problem.","Only a coward will use a gun to protect and get respect for themselves.","I'm still a soldier, fighting with my pen and paper for peace till the day I cease.","War destroys people's souls. Most people focus on physical injuries, but the invisible injuries can take a lifetime to heal and affects the lives of generations to come.","In times of war, starvation, hunger and injustice, such tragedy can only be put aside if you allow yourself to be uplifted through music, film and dance.","Sometimes words are not needed, and the simplicity of expressing yourself through an art form is one of the best ways of communication.","I'm constantly seen as a 'foreigner,' and I need my passport to prove my identity, to keep moving and to carry on my work.","Any child soldier has to go through a lot of love, care and understanding to become normal.","Violence in Darfur is cataclysmic.","In Africa, you know, if you're poor, at least you can go to the forest and share some mangoes with the gorillas and monkey.","Music - it's the only thing that can enter your system, your mind, your heart, without your permission.","I would advise dancers, musicians and others in the entertainment industry to take up yoga, as it clears the mind and creates a sense of balance and stillness which is important for any performing artist.","When I first went to school, I was fighting all the time. The soldier mentality was still in me. I kept getting expelled. I found it hard to take instructions from anyone who wasn't a military commander.","We lack role models who can inspire our young people to make change.","Knife crime and gun crime is poverty-driven, and poverty leads to insecurity.","The wealthiest Sudanese don't know what war is. Their children are safe in school.","I don't take modern hip-hop as real. It's entertaining, it's fake, like James Bond.","What music does to me, it helps me balance my inner pressure so that I can deal with the forces outside that are trying to pressure me.","I still have nightmares of dead comrades, a long time ago, talking to me. 'Emmanuel, don't forget about us, don't give up, keep telling our story.'","If I sleep for more than half an hour, I get horrible dreams in which I'm firing a gun and helicopters are coming down.","I lost my childhood. I didn't play football or video games. Or have birthdays or the love of a family.","There's no pride in having been a child soldier.","I'm rapping in English but in an African way. I'm not trying to sound like an American.","When you see a Sudanese walking on the street, there is a story.","As a child, I didn't know what they mean by 'to die.' So I grew up in a place where people used to die all the time, but a child is not allowed to see a dead body. When you ask, 'Where is so-and so?' you're told, 'He's gone to another world where we all go to live in the future.'","Young people are so brave when they go to fight.","For many Sudanese, it's for strength they choose to be Christian rather than Muslim. My mum was a Muslim but she became a Christian later.","The only foreign policy advice I heard from China was when they said to Sudan, 'Don't go back to war.' That's all they said. They didn't push anything else.","I don't know anywhere where the people are hungrier for education than South Sudan.","Music moves my emotions because music loosens me up.","In Africa, music is for everything, Music was originally used for community. That was what music was for.","I grew up in poverty. For 25 years I was fed on aid.","What I always wanted to do when I was a kid was to speak out and help people which I continue to do afterwards.","The first time I experienced war, I thought the world was ending.","When people know you've been a soldier, they judge you: you are a thief, a lost boy.","A cold heart is my protection mechanism. I don't really feel anything for anyone.","When I listen to hip-hop, it's like no big difference how people sing in my village, 'cause bling would be their cow.","I was shocked when I came to New Orleans. I never knew there were beggars on the streets here. I didn't know that there were poor people. I thought this was Heaven, you know?","When I was in south Sudan, people used to rap in my village. But the rapping was more in the mother tongue, Nuer.","Education is the only solution for peace.","I'm kind of weird - I don't get excited. Sometimes I fake that I'm excited just to make people happy.","A lot of child soldiers lose their minds.","When you don't educate the people, you're crippling them. You are, you're not giving them ways to survive.","If you really kill, you don't want to talk about it."],"Emmanuel Lewis":["I know what kind of person he is so they can say whatever they want.","Michael is not only my friend, he's my family.","We said, OK. We'll - as long as you take good care of us. And so it was a lot of fun. There was a lot of ups and downs throughout the whole period of time. And it's a very unique experience.","The only place I can go where I'm not mobbed is my house.","People thought I was this doll that came to life, so I would have different people just treating me very strangely as far as I was concerned. They wanted to see if I was real.","I want to direct, produce, and write, learning as I go.","I do what I believe.","Since I know how crazy this business is, I do the opposite of what I see other people doing.","Sometimes kids used to give me a hard time. But they're on my side.","I'm perfectly healthy.","I like projects in which I can really act and not be me all the time."],"Emmanuel Lubezki":["I think the audience doesn't know a movie's lit, but they feel it. Because you've walked in a forest many times, or in a park, so you know how it looks. When you start lighting, subconsciously you know there is something that is absolutely wrong.","When you're shooting with long lenses, even if you're shooting a close-up, you feel the air, the distance between the camera and the subject.","For each movie that I do, I like to find a specific language to tell the specific story.","The more tools we have directors and cinematographers will be able to express more and create different worlds and feelings. It's like having more instruments in an orchestra.","The language of film is further and further away from the language of theater and is closer to music. It's abstract but still narrative.","A normal day of working in Burbank is 14 hours, sometimes more. On 'The Revenant' sometimes it was eight hours, but we were shooting only five. So they were short days, but they were very strenuous because of the weather. And it was very dark.","I have two daughters, and they grew up and wanted to get into Instagram, and I didn't know anything about social media. I started it to learn about what they were starting to do and how they communicate with their friends. I opened an account. Very fast, in a few hours, I realized that I actually liked it.","I have a very healthy dream life. I dream a lot many, many, many nights a week. When I'm shooting, it's even more - I don't know if it has to do with stress or with creation.","'Little Princess' was the first big movie that I did in America with big stages where we had kind of a different schedule to work. We had a great production designer, Bo Welch, and we had time to think about the movie in pre-production.","I was able to shoot a movie like 'Tree of Life' because I had done 'Y Tu Mama Tambien.' The camera needed to capture that sense of freedom and joy and life you have when you're young.","On 'Y Tu Mama Tambien,' we started exploring shots that are longer, where the camera is moving around the actors, and there are no cuts, and you feel like you're there.","The dynamic range of the digital camera is pretty crappy compared to film, but now film is not great because the labs have closed. It's going to hurt a lot of the movies that we did in this gap because I think they are going to look very old very soon.","The most important thing in imaging for me is the dynamic range. The dynamic range means the tones that you can capture from highlights to dark and the bits, the depth of color that you can capture.","I would love if film doesn't disappear, if we can have film forever so we would have all these brushes, all these possibilities available.","I'm very attracted to directors who want to experiment. The thing that attracts me the most are people who are trying find a language that is correct for their film, for that specific film.","I can tell you that going to the Oscars is not as exciting as people think, at least for me.","I did sound for a number of years, so I know the pain of the sound mixer on a set where everybody was talking.","I don't miss film projecting. I always hated it."],"Emmanuel Macron":["When politics is no longer a mission but a profession, politicians become more self-serving than public servants.","We have the force, the energy, and the determination, and we will not give in to fear.","Globalization can be a great opportunity.","Modernity is disruptive, and I endorse that.","We need people who dream impossible things, who maybe fail, sometimes succeed, but in any case who have that ambition.","The refugee crisis shows we can't be isolated from the world's geopolitical troubles.","To avoid the trap of Europe fragmenting on the economy, security, and identity, we have to return to the original promises of the European project: peace, prosperity and freedom. We should have a real, adult, democratic debate about the Europe we want.","As to the euro zone avant-garde, it must go towards more solidarity and integration: a common budget, a common borrowing capability, and fiscal convergence.","I think when people have pudding and jobs, they vote for you.","A romantic or classical view of the French approach would have been to say, 'It's a French company; let no one attack it. Let's block any merger. But the reality is Alcatel-Lucent is not a French company; it's a global company. Its main markets are China and the U.S. Its ownership is foreign; most of its managers aren't French.","Really, creation and innovation are part of the French DNA.","We are a continent of refugees, and if you say we can't integrate refugees, that's not consistent with our values, even if borders cannot be wide open.","Europe and the world are waiting for us to defend the spirit of Enlightenment, threatened in so many places.","We have a huge responsibility to make sure that Europe remains a prosperous and peaceful continent.","We're not isolated from the world. The world knocks on our door.","The status quo leads to self-destruction.","To create greater convergence, we need more intergration.","Believe in individual initiatives, in courage, in risk.","We have to breathe new life into Europe.","I touched the limits of our political system, which pushes one to last-minute compromises. Explanations are rarely given. It plays to people's fears because it hasn't built an ideological consensus. It produces flawed solutions and too often ignores reality.","I am not just a liberal movement. I come from the progressive Left. I am trying to refresh and counter the system.","What we need is much more flexibility for the labour markets.","I want to help with Muslim integration. If you follow the line of Marine Le Pen, you create a civil war.","I am from the Left, but I am happy to work with people from the Right.","Brexit is the other face of the refugee crisis - tensions that lead to stasis, external risks that lead to asymmetric shocks.","Popularity isn't my compass. Unless it can help one to act, to be understood... that's what counts.","I have a vision of my country, and I cannot sit and watch things pass by.","I am proud of my immaturity and political inexperience.","Sovereignty is not just at the national level; that's the mistake of Brexit that other people make.","Our language, history, and civilization shine out across every continent.","I want to unite our people and our country. I will serve you with humility and force in the name of liberte, egalite, fraternite.","I will fight with all my power against the divisions that undermine us and which are tearing us apart.","The doctors, whether based in Brussels or Paris, draw the same conclusions and write the same prescriptions.","Consolidation means less equipment, less networks, and less jobs.","My priority is my economy minister mandate and to create momentum.","We have no choice but to reform this country.","The best way to afford a suit is to work.","I'm not a movie star, and I don't want to become a movie star.","It's about our ability precisely to integrate a people and offer jobs, and that, for me, is one of the key rationales of the reforms I'm pushing, and I'm a strong believer in that when you lift barriers, when you deregulate a lot of stuff, basically you improve the equality of opportunities.","I learned the life of business, commerce - it's an art.","If approval was a criterion in this country, nothing would ever get done.","We need to go faster on structural reforms in France.","What matters to me is to find rational solutions for those that are facing difficulties so that France preserves jobs and its ability to innovate.","We have to be extremely strict on the implementation of Brexit so there is a common approach between member states. We must avoid a sector-by-sector or country-by-country approach, and ask the U.K. to be clear.","We back Hinkley Point project. It's very important for France; it's very important for the nuclear sector and EDF.","We should not replicate the situation where one country is in a situation to hijack the rest of Europe because they organize a referendum.","You need a debate and a vote on the principles: Do you want more Europe or less Europe? Do you believe we are more efficient with defense and security with Europe, or not? Do you believe we are more efficient for our companies with or without Europe? Those are the questions we have to discuss and push our people to vote on it.","I don't have luxurious tastes or great needs, but my independence is worth a lot to me.","We have a lack of growth in Europe, in eurozone, and in France, and we are struggling hard to recover and restore this growth.","When you discuss your steel industry with China you are credible because you are part of the E.U., not because you are just U.K. You will be completely killed otherwise. You will never be in the situation to negotiate face to face with the Chinese because your domestic market is not relevant for the Chinese in comparison with their domestic market.","We have to accept the idea that Europe will be made on a two-speed basis, with a union based on solidarity and differentiation.","We have to reconcile Europeans with Europe.","Through work, education, and culture, I will give hope to our country.","Our interests lie in attracting added value and talent to France as a result of Brexit, but also in having a balanced relationship with Great Britain. We must not sacrifice the short term for our bilateral relationship.","You can block a marriage, but you cannot force a marriage.","A Left that does nothing achieves nothing.","Leaving the E.U. would mean the 'Guernseyfication' of the U.K., which would then be a little country on the world scale. It would isolate itself and become a trading post and arbitration place at Europe's border.","If I was British, I would vote resolutely 'remain' because it's in the U.K.'s interest.","If the U.K. wants a commercial access treaty to the European market, the British must contribute to the European budget like the Norwegians and the Swiss do. If London doesn't want that, then it must be a total exit.","Without investment, you cannot have jobs.","Historically speaking, the French economy was largely driven by the demand side.","France has to reform, to recover, and get more competitiveness.","France has to accelerate in terms of reform.","The refugee crisis is a challenge for the whole of Europe, and Europe - it's a very fair point to say it's not just a security issue. It's also an economic issue.","If people do not believe in Europe and in the euro area, it must be dismantled.","I am not a socialist.","I don't want a tailor-made approach where the British have the best of two worlds. That will be too big an incentive for others to leave and kill the European idea, which is based on shared responsibilities.","I am attached to a strict approach to Brexit: I respect the British vote, but the worst thing would be a sort of weak E.U. vis-a-vis the British.","We need to restore democracy and sovereignty in Europe.","Honesty compels me to say that I am not a socialist. But so what?","The functioning of our society is in a certain way sclerotic.","I am a newcomer. I want to remain a newcomer. That is my DNA.","De facto, you have a multi-speed Europe. You look at the Schengen, you look at the euro zone, all this kind of cooperations, you have a multi-speed Europe.","You need basically some accountability rules, which means democratic checks and balances at the euro zone level, and definitely, you have to increase convergence in terms of taxes, in terms of social affairs and so on.","What we need is a common goal for more Europe.","France is back.","Europe's younger generation has only experienced austerity.","The state has an offensive and defensive role to play as promoter of industrial policies, as regulator and as shareholder.","I want France to become the European hub for R&D.","The financial passport is part of full access to the E.U. market, and a precondition for that is the contribution to the E.U. budget. That has been the case in Norway and in Switzerland. That is clear.","We have the eurozone. Could we accept to be cleared, regulated, and de facto have inflows and outflows from a country that has decided to leave the E.U.? For me, definitely not.","I kept trying, proposing, pushing... If you want to succeed, you cannot leave work half done, and unfortunately, many things were left half done. The choice was made not to launch a second wave of economic reforms that I was proposing.","I push reforms. I tell the truth to people, even when it's tough for the country.","Popularity isn't an objective in itself. I'm not in this game.","We need young Frenchmen who want to become billionaires.","We've created rigidities at the entrance point in artisanal occupations.","You can suddenly have a series of countries waking up and saying, 'I want the same status as the Brits,' which will be, de facto, the dismantling of the rest of Europe.","Even if the Brits decide to remain, we will have to avoid a contagion on other countries.","I come all wreathed in a reputation the press has made for me. Judge me on my actions. That's all that counts.","We are implementing an in-depth reform on labor market, not to reduce rights for workers but to provide more visibility and more efficiency to investors and employers because it's the key for job creation.","E.U. is the first global domestic market.","To think that our political organisation is immutable is the best way to hand the country over to the extremes.","In a common project, we can bring together well-meaning people from the Left and the Right.","We will open a new bunch of reforms regarding the labor market to make it simpler and adaptable, more flexible.","Under the French system, you have to take into consideration that every five years, the president is directly elected by the people. He's the one that has the legitimacy.","When the president and the prime minister decide to implement reforms, they have all the measures they need to pass them and enforce them.","We ask our companies to restructure; we ask employees to work more for less money because there is overproduction, but then we're unable to defend them from cheaper Chinese imports. We are insane.","The only way governments or would-be governments respond to ills these days is by seeking to lower the temperature... and that tends to mean public spending.","We can't fix the real problems if we only cauterize and don't treat the roots of evil.","We have to provide more visibility, more certainty to the investors and reduce the cost of failure.","My key message is be innovative, be ambitious; think global and big on day one.","France is a strong, wealthy country.","I don't believe that killing the French model in order to become the U.K. or the United States overnight is the solution. You have a big debate on inequality there, and for our society, a lot of inequality would not be bearable.","We have to shift the social model from a lot of formal protections toward loosening bottlenecks in the economy.","I have decided to create a new political movement.","I'm in a left-wing government, unashamedly... but I also want to work with people from the Right who commit to the same values.","We can't have our industry progressively destroyed by cheap Chinese imports.","I don't want to create a too-big-to-fail player.","If I were to reason like those who roll out red carpets, I would say we might have some repatriations from the City of London.","I realised how much the system did not want to change.","I've taken my time. I've thought about it; I've consulted, and I've decided that we are going to create a new political movement, one that will be neither on the Right or the Left.","The 28-member Europe must be simpler, clearer, more efficient, and continue to advance on digital and energy issues.","I am not shy. I am for an open society. I am for a progressive world. I do not propose to reform France; I propose to transform it at its deepest level.","There are two projects facing each other. There's Marine Le Pen's project of a fractured, closed France. On the other hand, you have my project which is a republican, patriotic project aiming at... reconciling France.","Democratic states must have access to content exchanged between terrorists on social media and instant messaging.","Don't leave criticism of the E.U. to those who hate it.","Political experience is political inefficacy.","I'm a child of provincial France.","I make no concessions to conformism.","People find it difficult to accept something that is sincere and unique.","You have to learn to fight for things, to bear the burden and have a life which does not in any way correspond to other peoples' lives.","I bring the spirit of French conquest.","France has always succeeded because it is part of the world.","France will be on the front line in the fight against terrorism.","We have a great history; we have a great humanist face to put forward to the world.","I want to be the president of all the people of France, for the patriots facing the threat of nationalism.","The challenge is to open a new page in our political life and to take action so that everyone is able to find his or her place in France and in Europe.","I know the divisions in our nation that led some to extreme votes. I respect them.","I will lead a fight against Islamist terrorism at every level.","The French are consistent.","Europe and the world are waiting for us to defend the spirit of the enlightenment everywhere.","Long live the Republic, long live France.","No matter who you voted for, I do not hold anything against you.","We need to deal with the economy and the moral weakness of the country.","Never boo or hiss at my rallies. That is for people with no hope.","The strategy we must follow is to defend the special relationship between Great Britain and Europe and, more specifically, between Europe and France.","I want to become the president of all the people of France - the president of the patriots in the face of the threat from the nationalists.","There is no access to the market without budgetary contributions... and without respect for the four freedoms of the E.U.","I will defend Europe; it is our civilisation which is at stake... I will work to rebuild ties between Europe and its citizens.","I will do everything to make sure you never have reason again to vote for extremes.","My responsibility will be to unite all the women and men ready to take on the tremendous challenges which are waiting for us, and to act.","France was given up to fire and bloodshed, she experienced famine, she experienced the worst of things, she was nearly chopped up in pieces forever because of the decision... to exclude, to brand one party as guilty and annihilate them.","Our mission... it will be difficult, it will take time, it will be demanding for all men and women... will be to act in such a way that French people of the Muslim faith are always more proud of being French than of being Muslim.","I will protect and defend France's vital interests. I will protect and defend Europe."],"Emmanuel Teney":["Murder is not the crime of criminals, but that of law-abiding citizens.","As your faith is strengthened you will find that there is no longer the need to have a sense of control, that things will flow as they will, and that you will flow with them, to your great delight and benefit.","There are no guarantees. From the viewpoint of fear, none are strong enough. From the viewpoint of love, none are necessary."],"Emmanuelle Beart":["Beauty is not something you can count on. Usually, when people say you are beautiful, it is when there is a harmony between the inside and the outside.","Sometimes you feel more naked when you're totally dressed than the other way around.","My looks mean nothing to me. If anything, they are a hindrance.","There is a phrase in French, which means 'to miss.' To pass by. To not be able to stop. You love someone and someone loves you, but it just can't work for different reasons.","Often, when you see yourself on the screen, you feel like a sweater that's been put through the washing machine. You have the impression of having done something full and luminous, and suddenly, when you see it on the screen, it's turned back into a tiny little thing.","I am a voyager - and the voyage cannot mean that I stay at home.","When you are happy and in love and when you have children, then maybe you are beautiful.","I have never had so much fun as in Montreal. I taught the kids French, I baby-sat, I went to school, I was a receptionist at a hairdresser's, I danced and drank all night. I found that the more you do, the more you have time to do... it's weird, non?","I give everything I have to give on the screen. I feel I don't owe the public anything else.","I just decided that I would not put my professional life on hold to raise children. I know that sounds selfish to a lot of people and I don't know if what I'm doing is the right thing. But that's the way I'm doing it.","The body is an actor's tool, like the face, malleable. I never thought that being naked was immoral or outrageous.","The body, in 'La Belle Noiseuse,' was the source of the artist's creativity.","Once I opened my eyes to the realities of life, I couldn't close them.","We were raised without movies, theater or music. We had only nature, the hills, the trees. When I got on the set of 'Manon,' I wasn't star-struck because I didn't know what a star was.","After 10 years of French torture - psychological torture - it's great to do an American movie.","I stay in France. Better to be the queen of a village than a servant in a kingdom.","I had my mouth done when I was 27. It was a botched job. Obviously, if I had liked my mouth I wouldn't have had it re-done.","If a man or woman has something redone it is because he or she can no longer live with that part of their body, it is no longer bearable. Either they get help and find the strength to fight or they proceed with the act.","Today I would say, 'I am against plastic surgery.' It's a grave act. An act that touches our soul. It was frightening.","I keep reading that I'm cold. But I'm not, I'm shy. And I play a lot of women of fire and sexuality like an animal - so I'm cold on one side and fiery on the other.","My parents sent me to Montreal because I kept getting kicked out of school in France.","When I'm playing a part, I can feel all my body playing it; it's like really making love.","If I have one thing perfect, it's my eyebrows. And my feet. I love my feet. They're like Japanese feet. The rest I would like to hide. Especially my freckles. I feel ridiculous.","In Hollywood there's no real material. They would send me stuff, but I hadn't even seen the director. If I don't see the director's eyes, I'm not going. I'm not even going to pack my bags.","I can't just react on the strength of an email and three pages of synopsis, and say I'm going to take off for three months of my life.","I don't give a damn about Hollywood.","It is not easy to grow old in this business, when you are a woman above all, in the cinema.","It is not easy to age in harmony with one's roles.","I am an actress, I earn money, I am well-known. I don't think it is altruism to become engaged in humanitarian work. It's the least one can do.","I don't always see my movies right away. And there are some I haven't seen at all. Sometimes that bothers the directors, so I'm obliged to see them.","There are moments when you feel that the desire to work is fading, and the only way to bring it back is to get away from it, to put yourself in a state of frustration so you feel the need again.","Very often with an American movie, the end is very happy and you just feel good when you go out. When you go to a French movie, it's kind of like, oh!, and you can't go out; you're stuck in your chair. It goes so deeply inside of the heart.","I was a very bad student. I didn't know what I wanted to do, but I knew I didn't want to go farther in school. I hated school and was always the bad one; I was always insulting the teachers.","You may think of me as an object of desire and I'm going to tell you that I can be in front of you naked and not be erotic.","There are a lot of films where I play characters that are about the windows to the interior person rather than the exterior.","For me, I don't feel it is a success in the career to be the pretty woman; career success comes from being characters who tell us something about the truth.","I dream about singing. I would love to sing and write.","I've just done a film in the United States. It's a thriller called 'A Crime', with Harvey Keitel, we play against each other, and it's so great to play in another language. But I'm definitely not American.","I played football when I was little. I didn't want to be an actress at all, I wanted to be a majorette in an Australian circus. That was my ambition.","I started acting without any vocation. I continued out of love.","My looks haven't prevented me from playing prostitutes or people broken by life. But when they need a token blonde with big breasts, that's OK, too. It's part of the game.","We've all had that fear, that despair of losing someone, or this fierce desire because it's not reciprocated. The less reciprocation there is, the more desire we have.","I wouldn't say I was a rebel as such, but I certainly wasn't right at school.","My body is an instrument for me to use.","I feel better in my body now than when I was 20. Why not?","I'm less desperate now to express what's inside me, that's true - I act these days because it keeps me awake and interested, an eternal student.","The press follow me. I sue them. That's the deal.","I don't see my old films, but I think of the characters I played as friends, like the women I meet in my life who made strong impressions on me. I remember them and they are part of me.","I think my best work has been in France with great men. It's been my great fortune to work with really great men - with Olivier Assayas, Raoul Ruiz, Jacques Rivette. I am tutored by them.","I'm trying my best to keep my private life guarded. It's not easy at all. Non, non, non.","I have no TV, thank God. I haven't heard anything about Tom Cruise, except that he had a baby, I think.","Of course I am political. You 'ave to be don't you? Every day it is about your future, your right to that future. 'Ow can people ignore this? We 'ave to leave a good world for our children, n'est-ce pas?"],"Emmanuelle Charpentier":["I was a typical French student of the 1990s - I imagined that, after a short excursion, I would work the rest of my life at home.","Personally, I don't think it is acceptable to manipulate the human germline for the purpose of changing some genetic traits that will be transmitted over generations."],"Emmanuelle Chriqui":["I look at my father. He is one of my heroes. He is such an incredible, classy man. He was such a great father and such a great husband in so many ways, and we lived through some pretty tough times losing my mom. When I see all that he did, I think, 'Wow, that's a really wonderful man.'","A great day in New York would be to wake up, get a cup of coffee and head up to Central Park for a nice walk. Then I'd go down to the East Village and stroll around. After that, maybe I'd go check out a museum or catch an indie film at the Angelika.","We have this idea of perfection that is so unrealistic. We are our own worst enemy. No one is noticing that little scar.","I appreciate humor so much, but I'm actually not a funny girl.","When you have confidence, that's what becomes attractive to other people and makes them want to work with you and spend time with you.","My career has been successful, but it's been a grind of hard work.","Someone once told me that the most dynamic actors are people who have stories. People who have lived life. People with experiences.","The girl next door isn't necessarily blonde and blue-eyed anymore. So I don't feel like I need to morph into that all-American thing.","Never reveal your insecurities to a man, because nine times out of 10 they have no idea they even exist.","For the record: I wear makeup. All. The. Time. But I do it in a way that looks natural.","I love European films in general. If I were to go to the movie store or something, that's what I like to see.","As a child I was given the freedom to explore my passion for acting, but I also grew up in a home where there were a lot of rules. I didn't have 'yes' parents.","When you're starting out, every line in a show or a commercial is like a huge success.","Acting is not glamorous. It's not. Anybody who wants to get into acting for the glamour is in for a hard time.","I don't know why, but in my career and in my life, I often find myself in situations where I am the only girl among boys.","One tip I like is don't forget your reusable bags when you go to the drug store or to the mall. I think most people think of the bags for the grocery store, but I try to take mine wherever I go.","I tell the most horrible jokes.","I feel like I want to be known first and foremost for my work.","Is it easy to avoid paparazzi? It is, it really is.","I love doing voice-over. It's so fun.","The beauty of voice-over work is that maybe you come in and record once every two weeks for a couple of hours and do a couple episodes a session. It's awesome! You spend an afternoon playing in the booth, and there you have it. It doesn't interfere with much.","I'm this little Canadian Jewish girl, and I'm living my dream.","I always describe my career as something where nothing ever popped overnight.","I love what I do, but I never want to OD on celebrity.","I have a theory that most people in Hollywood are from Texas.","I can celebrate food anytime. I love cheese. When I crave a certain food, I just eat it.","I'm actually very sensitive to energies, and when people are not aligned, I can feel that.","I have to be honest, I am a true jeans and t-shirt girl.","Most actors want to sink their teeth into amazing material.","I had to deal with death at a really young age.","When I look up and see a star, I know my mom is there. She's with me all the time. It's a powerful connection.","Reese Witherspoon is my everywoman. She's managed to have a family and this amazing career. That's the goal.","My elbows are double-jointed, so I can flip them inside out.","My mom was an aesthetician and she went to beauty school back in the '60s. I just remember watching her do her makeup all the time. She always had her nails done, makeup on - her face was ready to go when she went out. I loved it.","Generally for red carpet, I love to relax first. I love to work out. I love to eat well, drink tons of water beforehand, so on the night of the red carpet I feel good and ready to go. I also love to get a good body scrub.","I generally circuit train and do Pilates."],"Emmanuelle Riva":["I love life. I love life to death.","Acting makes you live plenty of lives.","Love is the essence of life; love touches all of our work. Love never leaves us. It clings to us, and we cling to it.","In acting, you draw so much on your private life.","If by chance people would still offer me roles, I'd still like to do them. But if not, that's OK.","I've never wanted to be a star, never.","It is dreadful to see actors reproducing the same image constantly."],"Emmanuelle Seigner":["Everything in life, bad or good, makes you change and grow - happily, because if it didn't, we'd be machines.","I don't really want to find myself face-to-face with 10,000 paparazzi. I just want to be comfortable.","When my husband won the Palme d'Or in 2002, I wore the same dress two days in a row. My daughter said, 'Mom! Did you sleep in your dress?' But I think it's cool to wear the same thing. I have to feel comfortable.","I don't like the idea of fitting into a mould so as to conform. What I like is the danger, the difference - being unpredictable.","I've always been very good at convincing people. For instance, if I arrive in an airport and I'm in economy, I can always convince the guy to put me in first class.","I think age is just something written down on a piece of paper. I mean, you come across 20-year-olds who are like old people sometimes. I've never taken much account of age throughout my life - my own or anyone else's.","I've wanted to be Mick Jagger since I was 18. One of the things I love about music is that you don't have to be dependent on other people like you are in the film business. I hate being dependent on anyone. With my music, I can do whatever I want. I also think it's made me more relaxed as an actress.","I never had the slightest desire to have cosmetic surgery - partly because I don't want to look like an alien and partly because it's nice to age in a way. Also, I think that if your soul is beautiful, then the rest of you stays beautiful.","Sometimes when you do big movies, you can lose sometimes a little bit of soul.","'Venus in Fur' is very Polanski: you have the knife of 'Rosemary's Baby'; you have Thomas disguised as a woman as in 'The Tenant,' when Vanda puts makeup on him, it's like 'Cul de Sac'; the dress of Tess and other details that are very Polanski. He fell in love with the play because it was so much him.","I come from a family of actors. My grandfather was like a Laurence Olivier with the Comedie Francaise. Since I was four I went every week to the Comedie Francaise. My aunt and grandmother were there, but my grandfather was a big star.","My sister Mathilde is an actress, but more like a French Jennifer Aniston. She's famous just in France. She's very commercial and does big comedies. So, acting was part of my family, and that's how I was raised.","I'm sure my children will be artists. I hope they will direct because it is much more interesting. Acting is great, and I love it, but it is very passive, and it depends on other people's desire, and you depend on others all the time.","In France, I guess there's something like a tyranny in mentalities - we accept success badly, beauty, money. People are certainly envious, and this creates negative energy. This is annoying. I suffered a great deal at one time. I had to fight harder than others. Add to that my marriage to Polanski.","There's a lot of good roles for men, always, and for very young girls. But for women, not so many.","When I did 'Frantic,' I didn't have a lot of experience. My English was so bad, and I did an OK job, I think, but I was not amazing.","I did great things in the theater. I did some nice roles, 'The Diving Bell and the Butterfly' or 'La Vie en Rose.' And I love my role in 'Frantic.'","Acting in another language is great, and I've done that. But you can't do it as well as you can do it in your own language.","I grew up around the Luxembourg Gardens, so I guess that is my best memory.","I don't like French food. I like everything but French food."],"Emmanuelle Vaugier":["I like animals, I really do, but some animals are just meant to be eaten.","I love to go hiking. I hike every day for about 1 1/2 to 2 hours in the hills around LA. I go to the gym every day, too.","There's always a high school jerk, isn't there? But I didn't date much in high school, because I went to an all-girls' private school for ten years.","Horror movies have never been my thing. I love psychological thrillers like 'The Exorcist', 'The Shining', even though they scare the living daylights out of me.","When I was modeling in Japan, I could blend in a little because of my hair, but my roommates with blonde hair got harassed. People would touch their hair and grope them in the subway. Actually, a lot of groping happens in the subway in Japan, but that's probably true of subways everywhere.","When I have a little down time, I like to go to the gym and try to bank some hours there. I like to spend time with my dogs, go hiking, do a little traveling.","Would I put my daughter in a private all-girl school? No. Would I put her in a private co-ed school? Yes. Would I put her in the school I went to? No way."],"Emmeline Pankhurst":["You must make women count as much as men; you must have an equal standard of morals; and the only way to enforce that is through giving women political power so that you can get that equal moral standard registered in the laws of the country. It is the only way.","We are here, not because we are law-breakers; we are here in our efforts to become law-makers.","One baby is a patient baby, and waits indefinitely until its mother is ready to feed it. The other baby is an impatient baby and cries lustily, screams and kicks and makes everybody unpleasant until it is fed. Well, we know perfectly well which baby is attended to first. That is the whole history of politics.","When you have warfare, things happen; people suffer; the noncombatants suffer as well as the combatants. And so it happens in civil war.","There is something that Governments care for far more than human life, and that is the security of property, and so it is through property that we shall strike the enemy. Be militant each in your own way. I incite this meeting to rebellion.","My parents, especially my father, discussed the question of my brothers' education as a matter of real importance. My education and that of my sister were scarcely discussed at all.","If it is right for men to fight for their freedom, and God knows what the human race would be like today if men had not, since time began, fought for their freedom, then it is right for women to fight for their freedom and the freedom of the children they bear.","Manchester is a city which has witnessed a great many stirring episodes, especially of a political character. Generally speaking, its citizens have been liberal in their sentiments, defenders of free speech and liberty of opinion.","Justice and judgment lie often a world apart.","I have never advised the destruction of life, but of property, yes.","I suppose I had always been an unconscious suffragist. With my temperament and my surroundings, I could scarcely have been otherwise.","Often I have heard the taunt that suffragists are women who have failed to find any normal outlet for their emotions, and are therefore soured and disappointed beings. This is probably not true of any suffragist, and it is most certainly not true of me. My home life and relations have been as nearly ideal as possible in this imperfect world.","Trust in God - she will provide.","Every principle of liberty enunciated in any civilized country on earth, with very few exceptions, was intended entirely for men, and when women tried to force the putting into practice of these principles, for women, then they discovered they had come into a very, very unpleasant situation indeed.","Not by the forces of civil war can you govern the very weakest woman. You can kill that woman, but she escapes you then; you cannot govern her. No power on earth can govern a human being, however feeble, who withholds his or her consent.","Men make the moral code and they expect women to accept it. They have decided that it is entirely right and proper for men to fight for their liberties and their rights, but that it is not right and proper for women to fight for theirs.","It is perfectly evident to any logical mind that when you have got the vote, by the proper use of the vote in sufficient numbers, by combination, you can get out of any legislature whatever you want, or, if you cannot get it, you can send them about their business and choose other people who will be more attentive to your demands.","One does not expect to be comfortable in prison. As a matter of fact, one's mental suffering is so much greater than any common physical distress that the latter is almost forgotten.","The argument of the broken window pane is the most valuable argument in modern politics.","The whole argument with the anti-suffragists, or even the critical suffragist man, is this: that you can govern human beings without their consent.","My childhood was protected by love and a comfortable home. Yet, while still a very young child, I began instinctively to feel that there was something lacking, even in my own home, some false conception of family relations, some incomplete ideal.","Window-breaking, when Englishmen do it, is regarded as honest expression of political opinion. Window-breaking, when Englishwomen do it, is treated as a crime.","I have made speeches urging women to adopt methods of rebellion such as have been adopted by men in every revolution.","Holloway Prison is a very old place, and it has the disadvantages of old places which have never known enough air and sunshine. It reeks with the odours of generations of bad ventilation, and it contrives to be at once the stuffiest and the draughtiest building I have ever been in.","Solitary confinement is too terrible a punishment to inflict on any human being, no matter what his crime. Hardened criminals in the men's prisons, it is said, often beg for the lash instead.","Those men and women are fortunate who are born at a time when a great struggle for human freedom is in progress. It is an added good fortune to have parents who take a personal part in the great movements of their time. I am glad and thankful that this was my case.","I have not personally suffered from the deprivations, the bitterness and sorrow which bring so many men and women to a realisation of social injustice.","The militancy of men, through all the centuries, has drenched the world with blood. The militancy of women has harmed no human life save the lives of those who fought the battle of righteousness.","The English prison system is altogether mediaeval and outworn. In some of its details, the system has improved since they began to send the Suffragettes to Holloway. I may say that we, by our public denunciation of the system, have forced these slight improvements.","I was fourteen years old when I went to my first suffrage meeting. Returning from school one day, I met my mother just setting out for the meeting, and I begged her to let me go along.","From infancy, I had been accustomed to hear pro and con discussions of slavery and the American Civil War. Although the British government finally decided not to recognise the Confederacy, public opinion in England was sharply divided on the questions both of slavery and of secession."],"Emmerson Mnangagwa":["I was with the former president for over 54 years. I don't regret that; I feel very proud. It was necessary. It is history. Each step where we worked together was a privilege, and in terms of history, that was necessary.","You know the trait of a crocodile, don't you? It never hunts outside water. It always goes into the water to catch its prey. It never goes in the villages or in the bush looking for food. It strikes at the appropriate time. So a good guerrilla leader strikes at the appropriate time.","We work together. No one is more important than the other. We are all Zimbabweans. We want to grow our economy. We want peace in our country.","We should never remain hostages of our past.","The people's voice, as I say, is the voice of God.","Capital goes where it feels comfortable and warm, and if it's cold, it runs to a country which gives it better weather.","Zanu-PF is a sacred party. It will rule and rule. Those barking will continue doing that while Zanu-PF remains in power.","I see myself a humble man, and I tell you I have no ambitions to be president.","I wish to be clear: all foreign investments will be safe in Zimbabwe.","We must allow people to agitate for whatever they want. They must be allowed to campaign for their views.","Government is a collective unity. There is no decision by cabinet which can be attributed to one individual.","It's the duty of any government: where there is disregard of the law, that law and order must be instituted."],"Emmet Fox":["The art of life is to live in the present moment, and to make that moment as perfect as we can by the realization that we are the instruments and expression of God Himself.","You must not under any pretense allow your mind to dwell on any thought that is not positive, constructive, optimistic, kind.","If you could only love enough, you could be the most powerful person in the world.","It makes no difference how deeply seated may be the trouble, how hopeless the outlook how muddled the tangle, how great the mistake. A sufficient realization of love will dissolve it all.","It is the food which you furnish to your mind that determines the whole character of your life.","Supply yourself with a mental equivalent, and the thing must come to you.","As thy days, so shall thy strength be which, in modern language, may be translated as thy thoughts so shall thy life be.","Life is a state of consciousness.","You must not allow yourself to dwell for a single moment on any kind of negative thought."],"Emmett Kelly":["A clown's makeup and character, that's all he has to sell. He loves and believes in that character.","By laughing at me, the audience really laughs at themselves, and realizing they have done this gives them sort of a spiritual second wind for going back into the battles of life.","'Weary Willie' is very real to me. He is a man who has given up. The boat has gone and left him. The cards are stacked against him. He's content to make out with what he's got. He knows he'll go no further.","Incongruity, they say, is one of the main ingredients of humor. Maybe it's because everybody can feel superior to me. I honestly don't know.","I haven't had a stationary home since going with the circus, but since my parents lived in Lafayette about 25 years ago and my sister lives here now, I always claim it as home."],"Emmett Shear":["A goal of Twitch is to be wherever gamers are, whether it's on laptops and handheld devices or integrated into gaming consoles and software.","There's no bigger gaming franchise on the console than 'Call of Duty', and we can't wait to see what the community can create with this new tool.","Our app for Xbox 360 brings Twitch video to the television and into the living room of millions of Xbox Live members for the first time. The app will let every Xbox Live gamer find and watch streams of their favorite games from their couch.","Twitch launched in June of 2011, and our growth ever since has exceeded even my expectations, which were not small. A year and a half later, the community of broadcasters and viewers has multiplied hundreds of percent.","Given the growing popularity of pop culture conventions, many of them are selling out, leaving a lot of fans out in the dark and having to trawl the Internet for bits and pieces of news that relate to these events.","Given the huge number Xbox owners and how many of them love gaming spectatorship, it's a natural fit to bring the Twitch experience to the 360.","I'm always impressed by how compassionate the gaming community can be when they have a cause and appreciate that they leverage our platform to raise money for those in need. We continue to encourage giving in support of important causes, including Extra Life 2012.","The Twitch community loves watching video games, chatting, and broadcasting. The average viewer watches over an hour and a half of video each day. Over two-thirds of our logged-in users chat each day."],"Emmitt Smith":["Vision gets the dreams started. Dreaming employs your God-given imagination to reinforce the vision. Both are part of something I believe is absolutely necessary to building the life of a champion, a winner, a person of high character who is consistently at the top of whatever game he or she is in.","For me, winning isn't something that happens suddenly on the field when the whistle blows and the crowds roar. Winning is something that builds physically and mentally every day that you train and every night that you dream.","We are all born naked into this world, but each of us is fully clothed in potential.","I'm an enigma, an unknown. You can't really figure out what I'm going to do next. I like it like that.","As a former football player who has carried a football more than 4,000 times, trust me, I did not go into ballroom dancing with my body being 100 percent, with no aches or pains or ailments coming with me. When you're dancing, you're doing stuff that your body's not used to, and so you start to aggravate those old injuries.","Dreaming means 'rehearsing' what you see, playing it over and over in your mind until it becomes as real to you as your life right now.","If I didn't have a scholarship to go to the University of Florida or any school, I probably would have considered the military because my family could not afford to send me to college.","Do not compare yourself. Find out what God has placed in your ability.","If you know anything about me, I've never been a trash-talker. That's not even part of my DNA.","Always, through my whole life, I've had a thirst for knowledge.","Consistency is one of the hallmarks of my career. You knew what you were going to get out of E-Smith every game, every year, no matter if I was 22, 21 or 35 years old.","Demand excellence.","I've given everything I can possible to the game, on and off the field.","I used to send Tony Romo texts throughout the season just to encourage him, just to wish him luck and just to tell him to get on his offensive line. I hated watching this young man get sacked as much as he did, especially when it came down to big games.","I was going through a little bit of turbulence in my career. And so, it's funny how turbulence itself will make you hold onto something for security. And so the only thing I knew is trust in the Lord and lean not unto your own heart, in all thy ways acknowledge him and he shall direct thy path.","My father is Emmit and my grandfather is Emmit, but I wanted something extra so I could separate my Emmitt from the rest of them. Even though on my birth certificate it has one T, I just added the extra T for me.","Charles Haley changed the way the Cowboys played football in the 90s. And the reason why I say that is because he was such a dominant force coming off the edge, where it took two and three to block him.","I was actually looking for answers where I kept asking myself - what am I doing?","My mom said, 'Don't get married. You're too young. Go out there and experience what life has to offer.' And I did.","It's been a tremendous ride. My 15 years, my 15 minutes of fame, is up.","If you're not settled spiritually, things can be a little bit more chaotic than normal.","I've learned that football sometimes was an outlet. It was a way for me to release anger, release frustration.","Sixteen games, to me, is a long enough schedule for anybody. We're already concerning ourselves with head injuries and bodily harm to all of the professional athletes. Add to extra games to it, (and) you are just increasing those risks.","One thing I can say about the Dallas Cowboys: They have always had talent around them. They have been one of the most talented football teams in all of football.","I know how important it is to have your quarterback standing upright. Matter of fact, I know how important it is not to allow someone hit on him period because I want him to think that this pocket is completely safe, no one is going to get to me and I got all the time in the world to make whatever decisions I need to make.","I used to imagine what it would be like to do what Jim Brown was doing. I used to imagine what it would be like to be like a Tony Dorsett. I used to imagine what it would be like to be like a Walter Payton. I was imagining Emmitt Smith doing exactly what they were doing.","I have been a Cowboys fan since I was a little bitty boy. And my dream has finally become a reality, of not only just playing a professional, becoming a professional athlete, but playing for the team that I always wanted to play for.","I enjoyed being a teammate of Deion Sanders. He brings different elements to the game that many people would not even realize, and to watch and witness a superior talent like him and watch him prepare and train, and study the game is truly amazing.","I don't have to put on shoulder pads and run out there and let somebody hit on me a little bit.","I don't have to get up in the morning and go beat up my body like I used to. I don't have to be out there in August in 108 degree weather down in Texas.","I have achieved everything that I ever wanted to accomplish in this game and more so, for me, I have been fulfilled.","There's a lot of dancing in football. You can see Victor Cruz doing a little bit of a cha-cha or samba move in the end zone. You can see Terrell Owens getting his popcorn ready. You can see Ochocinco doing the riverdance. But not so much when it comes to ballroom."],"Emmy Rossum":["Being yourself is one of the hardest things because it's scary. You always wonder whether you'll be accepted for who you really are. I decided to call my record 'Inside Out' because that's my motto about life. I don't think you ever succeed at trying to be anyone else but who you truly are.","It's the best feeling when you wake up and it's warm and cozy, and you don't have to go to work.","I can put my legs behind my head and sing 'Happy Birthday.' Because that's something that me and my friends used to do when we were in gymnastics class as kids, and I can still do it. I was doing it since I was 8 and 9. They used to call me Gumby. Very bendy.","There's something safe about playing a character, but then it's like, 'Who am I underneath it all?'","Too many times you come across lyrics that sound like you've heard them before or you can't really relate to them. And I think that I write songs that sound fresh and sensual in kind of a layered, lush way. But I also think that they are real, and that's why I wanted to call the record 'Inside Out.'","I've learned to take jobs as an actress that is meaningful to me because I've never taken a job for the money.","She's lonely and wounded and very vulnerable and it really is a story about people at the heart of it all.","I don't really live my life in the media spotlight. People don't know that much really about me or what I think.","When I was in school, I got there on the first day and everyone had long, blonde, straight hair, and I had short, dark, curly hair. I immediately felt I didn't fit in and started growing my hair. But I've learned that I'm only happy when I am truly me and feel comfortable and confident in myself.","I started working when I was seven and I was working for five dollars a night at the Met.","I know that I am my worst critic. I know that if I can walk away from the set at the end of the day and feel that I did the best job I could and feel proud, that's what will satisfy me.","I started singing at the Met when I was seven, and the competition was so fierce that it really prepared me.","I try to keep myself as sane and as grounded as possible by surrounding myself with normal people, such as all the friends that I've had from when I was little.","I've been in the studio experimenting on making a CD of my own. I'm trying out different producers, styles, sounds. With music, as opposed to acting, you are not playing a character. You are showing people who you are. I really want to have my spirit in it.","Here we spent so much time together - eight months of our lives almost - and it was so great because we all got so close and that really made us not afraid to improve with each other.","It is very grand and sumptuous and awesome to look at but it was really about the characters for me.","I feel like I've come out of this grown up, maybe because I live through the character vicariously and she grows up so much during the course of this story.","It wasn't my intention in going after this part but I suppose now I do. The adult roles are a lot meatier - you're not always just the daughter or the girlfriend or whatever.","Everyone messes up in relationships and has peaks and valleys in their personal lives. When I realized it wasn't the end of the world and I would keep on standing, I knew it was going to be OK.","Guys usually like a very natural look. I think it's bad idea to wear a strong lip on a first date - or for the first few dates. I'm always too nervous he'll kiss it off - if I'm lucky enough to get a kiss! I also think soft, sexy hair is important.","I've never had my brows done - I tweeze them myself. I used to watch my mom pluck her brows, that's how I learned.","I had classical training but I don't consider myself an opera singer though.","If I can't find a project that I'm really interested in, I'll just go back to college where I've been studying art history and French. I'm also going to study English and philosophy - the whole curriculum!","Music is also a part of who I am so I'm thinking about recording an album.","I'd say that my musical influences are anywhere from pop-rock electronica, new age and classical. But I think that specifically, bands - I love Jem, I love Sigur Ross, I love David Gray, I love Elliot Smith... a lot of different people. But I don't find lyrical inspiration from anybody.","I never walk into the studio and say, I'm going to write a song called... 'X' or called 'Slow Me Down.' I write a ton of lyrics, often the title is somewhere in those 10 pages of... I call it brain vomit. It's kind of like whatever comes out of my head and I'm unabashedly just writing it down.","I hope that I'm sexy in a different kind of way than I think that a lot of girls are right now. I think a lot of girls in the public eye, especially musical artists, are just kind of objectified a little bit and wearing super-skimpy outfits and leaving nothing to the imagination.","I think we're all a lot more like our parents than we want to admit.","I've never had siblings, I didn't grow up in a big family; it was just me and my single mom. And hectic family dysfunction was actually something that I craved.","People who take risks like Amy Winehouse and Norah Jones take a second to catch on, but eventually they do because they're different and honest in a musical landscape that's not always like that."],"Emmylou Harris":["Somehow, when you think about yourself in old age, you think you're going to be this completely different person that you don't even recognize - because you can't imagine it, you know?","In 1974 I was trying to get my first little band together. That year marked kind of a traumatic point in my life, but I had a lot of support from friends and family and a lot of good things ended up coming out of it.","I think musicians are always very generous in promoting anything good they hear. It's just kind of in our nature.","You know, I'm a fan of Laurie Anderson. One of my favorite records is 'The Ugly One With the Jewels,' a spoken-word record. It's an extraordinary album.","I didn't have any money. I had a sense of terrible loss. But what I also had was a fire in my belly. I wasn't going to go back to waiting tables. I felt I had to be better at fronting a band.","I find with records, they become what they're going to become. They take on a power and a direction of their own. Part of making records is to honor that and not try to force it.","Animals have a much better attitude to life and death than we do. They know when their time has come. We are the ones that suffer when they pass, but it's a healing kind of grief that enables us to deal with other griefs that are not so easy to grab hold of.","When there are dogs and music, people have a good time.","I don't ever worry about whether I'm being true to my country roots. My country roots were adopted. I never worry about what I can do and what I should do. I just do what I want to do.","I'm not a trained musician. When folks talk about 'Well, you go to this or that' - the tenor, or the third part - I don't really know what they're talking about.","Every life is precious.","I was a folk singer who became totally over the edge with country music. I found my voice and style working with Gram Parsons. I learned how to listen to George Jones records and the Louvin Brothers.","I'm blessed to be able to work at something that I'm good at, and that I love. It's not something I take for granted.","My parents were not very happy. They were very worried about me pursuing a career that even if I had talent might not give me the happiness and the success that they - any parent hopes for their child.","Pretty much all I say politically is I encourage people to register to vote.","As citizens we have to be more thoughtful and more educated and more informed. I turn on the TV and I see these grown people screaming at each other, and I think, well, if we don't get our civility back, we're in trouble.","To me acting and singing are worlds apart.","I like to think about stringing songs together like a string of pearls, or a string of beads, but ultimately it has to be stuff that really works with the band, and gives a spin to the older material.","I'm very influenced by landscapes, not so much the way places look as the way the names sound. In this country we've got so many cultures, and the place names - the Spanish names and the Indian names, which are so incredibly musical.","The only time I ever appeared in the 'Enquirer' was for a piece about people who let their hair grow gray. I guess I'm not much of a wild child.","I'm nowhere with country music. I don't hear much of it, so I shouldn't venture an opinion, but when it finds me, it seems formulaic.","Country taught me how to sing, it put me on a path. But I was never going to be locked into a formula. I don't want to be considered a current country artist.","I have just enough people paying attention that I have the freedom to be in charge. And I have a great record company - Nonesuch understands what I'm about.","You get to a certain point in your life where you get closer to the end of your life than the beginning, and it colors your life, in a way.","There's a certain grace in accepting what your life is and embracing all the good things that have been - but there's still an expectation of good things to come. Not necessarily what you expected.","You meet a lot of people and have a lot of experiences, and they color you and stay with you - but I'm not the grieving widow. Life is much more complicated and interesting and full of zigs and zags than that.","I really have shaken hands with where my voice is right now. I think it's got a little deeper; it's got some more grooves in it.","I have to have a guitar sitting around. I sing in the shower. I sing around the house. The music comes secondary. The lyrics come first.","Well, I've always been eclectic.","Well, I'm just very blessed that I still love my work and I can still work, I still have an audience and I love what I do.","I'm even able to have kind of a little bit of a second career in dog rescue. Doesn't pay anything, but it's become a real passion for me.","I think I can be pretty focused, but as I say, it was more wanting to be the good student, seeing myself as a good student, and also, my parents had expectations. They wouldn't have cared if I got a B or a C or even a D.","You really do learn every day with every dog; they are all so unique and different. But if you're patient and you understand where they're coming from, and if you are consistent, they will be fine. They teach you to give your full attention.","As anyone who goes into dog-rescue knows, it is not a for-profit business, but the rewards are priceless for me.","Yes, I always say that we're a National League band. What I mean is, if you play an instrument, you have to sing. So I always call our drummer up. Even the drummer has to take a turn on the microphone.","I love Chicago, but I didn't think I had enough soul to be a Cubs fan.","If I'm crazy, I'm blissfully so!","I have my own biography of Gram Parsons - I don't want to be part of somebody else's.","Bluegrass has a very, very strict musical form. Once you start to dilute it, it disappears.","I look at my voice and my abilities as a gift. I don't feel that I can even take any credit for it, but it's such a huge presence in my life. It is my life. It's my identity, it's everything. And it's given me a great deal of joy and a sense of purpose - I can't imagine my life without it."],"Emo Philips":["A computer once beat me at chess, but it was no match for me at kick boxing.","My classmates would copulate with anything that moved, but I never saw any reason to limit myself.","You don't appreciate a lot of stuff in school until you get older. Little things like being spanked every day by a middle-aged woman: Stuff you pay good money for in later life.","Some mornings, it's just not worth chewing through the leather straps.","I got in a fight one time with a really big guy, and he said, 'I'm going to mop the floor with your face.' I said, 'You'll be sorry.' He said, 'Oh, yeah? Why?' I said, 'Well, you won't be able to get into the corners very well.'","In our school you were searched for guns and knifes on the way in and if you didn't have any, they gave you some.","The way I understand it, the Russians are sort of a combination of evil and incompetence... sort of like the Post Office with tanks.","Women: You can't live with them, and you can't get them to dress up in a skimpy little Nazi costume and beat you with a warm squash or something.","I was at a bar nursing a beer. My nipple was getting quite soggy.","At my lemonade stand I used to give the first glass away free and charge five dollars for the second glass. The refill contained the antidote.","I discovered my wife in bed with another man, and I was crushed. So I said, 'Get off me, you two!'","When I was a kid I used to pray every night for a new bicycle. Then I realised that the Lord doesn't work that way so I stole one and asked Him to forgive me.","I was with this girl the other night and from the way she was responding to my skillful caresses, you would have sworn that she was conscious from the top of her head to the tag on her toes.","Probably the worst time in a person's life is when they have to kill a family member because they are the devil. But otherwise it's been a pretty good day.","When I wake up in the morning, I just can't get started until I've had that first, piping hot pot of coffee. Oh, I've tried other enemas.","You know what I hate? Indian givers... no, I take that back.","Whatever happened to the good ole days, when children worked in factories?","How many people here have telekenetic powers? Raise my hand.","I was walking down fifth avenue today and I found a wallet, and I was gonna keep it, rather than return it, but I thought: well, if I lost a hundred and fifty dollars, how would I feel? And I realized I would want to be taught a lesson.","I love to go down to the schoolyard and watch all the little children jump up and down and run around yelling and screaming. They don't know I'm only using blanks.","You know, at parties, people always ask, 'Where were you when Kennedy was shot?' Well, I don't have an alibi!","I love to go to the playground and watch the children jumping up and down. They don't know I'm firing blanks.","I was the kid next door's imaginary friend.","I'm a great lover, I'll bet.","I was sleeping the other night, alone, thanks to the exterminator.","I was in a bar the other night, hopping from barstool to barstool, trying to get lucky, but there wasn't any gum under any of them.","Probably the toughest time in anyone's life is when you have to murder a loved one because they're the devil.","Well, my brother says Hello. So, hooray for speech therapy.","I got some new underwear the other day. Well, new to me.","People always ask me, 'Where were you when Kennedy was shot?' Well, I don't have an alibi.","England is better only because I stand out there as 'unusual'.","I once heard two ladies going on and on about the pains of childbirth and how men don't seem to know what real pain is. I asked if either of them ever got themselves caught in a zipper.","I go from stool to stool in singles bars hoping to get lucky, but there's never any gum under any of them.","I once had a large gay following, but I ducked into an alleyway and lost him.","He taught me never to smile, which helps me when I visit disaster sites.","Actually, my cd was released in 1985, in return for two German missionaries and a Dutch urologist.","I asked my girlfriend, 'Will you marry me?' She said, 'We'll have to ask my father.' So we had a seance and Jack Ruby says, 'Hello!'","My jokes are in my head and I have a duplicate copy of my jokes in a lot of British comics' heads, where they are safe.","I ran five miles today. Then, finally, I said, 'Here, lady... take your purse.'","Always remember the last words of my grandfather, who said: 'A truck!'","People come up to me... concerned... that I'll reproduce."],"Emory Cohen":["Toronto is a special city, and the environment is perfect for the arts; free and alive. I'm a New Yorker, and Toronto reminds me of a much cleaner New York, so it's like coming home after your mom just cleaned your room for you; for me that's a lovely environment.","I'm zero to a hundred in almost every facet of my life.","The hardest thing is for me to let the work go and let myself just live. Every actor is different; they each have their own strengths and weaknesses; trust and ease are mine.","I come from an intense family - like, we're just intense people. Not bad people or anything, we are just very intense, and I have just always felt like people who weren't like that were just a kind of hiding it, like when I was really young in high school.","I'll play a happy character, but most characters are driven by a pain or a fear. They are driven by something deep down, and most people are like that in the sense. And so, that's what interests me.","It's not like every actor needs to train, but an actor will either develop their process through training or through working.","I am constantly interested in people who society calls 'bad' because I don't like to just buy into something that everybody's going to say. I want to investigate that for myself. With a character, you get to fully investigate that emotionally and understand the parts of them that are in pain and scared and are good. That's human.","When I was a kid, I saw 'Peter Pan,' and I loved Captain Hook and the Lost Boys because they were the 'bad boys.'","I'm glad I chose more vulnerable work about what is love and what is freedom and those kinds of things. But there's something innate in me where I always come back to characters with an edge.","If I wanted to play it safe, I'd get a normal job with a secure paycheck.","That's what separates actors - I'll take any risk for a performance.","After I did 'Brooklyn,' I did about five or six violent films in one way or another, and not always with me being the bad guy, but something violent about it to keep the street cred up, really.","I did 'Pines,' and everybody wanted me to be the bad boy. Then I did Tony in 'Brooklyn,' and everybody wanted me to be the sweet kid. So I just want to keep everybody on their toes. Basically, that was the thought process.","'House of a Thousand Corpses' by Rob Zombie - I love that movie. I really do.","There are shows that have been prematurely canceled, but I don't know if 'Smash' was one of them.","When I'm playing a bad guy, a lot of it is imagined: things I thought I wanted to do, but I never would do them.","When it comes to a love story, you're like, 'I've been in love before.' So it's closer to you than the other stuff, and for me, that can be less comfortable.","I'm a fourth-generation New Yorker. My family has been in New York for many, many years.","I really respect people who are just getting by with their 9 to 5s.","My family has artists, but they are all working artists. They are not movie stars. They don't get paid. I really respect that blue-collared ideology where they're just trying to make a living.","I want to do a rom-com. For me, where I come from, it would be such a stretch.","I'm kind of an all-or-nothing kind of guy.","I was 16 when I linked up with my manager - first person I ever auditioned for - and I've been in this ever since.","I told my father I wanted to act, and he stared renting all these classic films for me to watch.","The old joke in my family is that the last person who isn't from New York was coming from Russia.","I love a good loser.","My first two or three films, all I was trying to do was look cool. That's all I knew acting was.","Everyone's inspired by Brando. When I started acting, my dad showed me 'On the Waterfront,' and I thought, 'That's the coolest guy I've ever seen.'","I'm shying away from getting lost in really bad movies for really good money.","I'm just trying to be Emory Cohen."],"Empedocles":["The nature of God is a circle of which the center is everywhere and the circumference is nowhere.","Happy is he who has gained the wealth of divine thoughts, wretched is he whose beliefs about the gods are dark."],"Emperor Hirohito":["They do not depend upon mere legends and myths. They are not predicated on the false conception that the Emperor is divine and that the Japanese people are superior to other races.","I discovered freedom for the first time in England."],"Emraan Hashmi":["Just be yourself. Be honest, work towards a goal, and you'll achieve it.","I used to believe that the number eight is unlucky for me and would even avoid anything that would add up to 8 - like 17, 26 and so on. I would religiously visit astrologers and wear different stones to bring in good luck.","I am a bit difficult to be around sometimes. I can be stubborn on a lot of things, and I'm set, but I can also adapt in a conflict situation and don't hold on to an ego. I end up seeing the larger good and adapt to it, provided it benefits me. I may come across as a cold person, but I am extremely sentimental.","The 'serial kisser' tag that has been thrust on to me is a lame stereotype. It irritates me. Yes, there is sexual content in my movies, and I have never been apologetic about doing bold scenes. But it's not fair to tag me this way because that can be very stifling.","A person like me who has grown up in a mixed culture ought to be spiritual. My mother is a Catholic, my father is a Muslim, and my wife is a Hindu. Personally, I feel spirituality is about being clear-hearted. It involves a sense of connection with the divine.","I respect the Bible and offer namaz regularly. But I am ritualistic only up to a certain extent. I believe only in those rituals that I can understand and connect with, and conduct them my own way.","My hectic work schedule does not often permit me time to visit temples, but my conversations with God don't depend on idol worship. Inside my heart, I have developed and sustained a direct communication with Him.","With my physicality and my face, I don't think I could pull off a completely righteous guy. There's something devious about my eyes. I like characters with flaws and to see how they overcome those flaws. I want to play real people, and they're flawed, not perfect.","I think it is rather 'unsexy' to go under the knife and modify your appearance.","Somehow, I always knew I would get married by the time I was 27. Even in college, I had this weird thing in my head that I would get married when I was 27, and hopefully my career would be stable, and I'll have kids by 30. And that's exactly what has happened.","I am tired of kissing on screen. I have to do it because it is synonymous with me. Also, the producers and directors want to add that element. I don't give it too much importance.","If someone pulls me down, I pull them down, as I don't feel I should live my life in the way other people want me to. If they have a problem with my films, I can rip off their films, be it comedy or their family dramas, which are low on content and have over-theatrical acting.","When a film is successful, you don't need to shout about it from the rooftops. I don't believe in going into overdrive. There's no desperation to be acknowledged as the reason for a film's success.","I wanted to make money very fast, and I was completely confused after college. I didn't know what career options I had. And then I had this entry point in the film industry, and I thought, 'If this is where the fast money is going to come from, let's see how it goes.'","Everyone who means well gives advice based on his or her perception. I have realized that while it's important to hear the suggestions, one should only listen to oneself.","My faith in God is unshakeable, even though till date, I have not experienced any miraculous incident that makes me feel the presence of a higher power. But the trust in God has been engrained into my psyche since my childhood.","I don't know the definition of a star; I am just an actor. I prefer doing hard work, as I feel luck can't do much in absence of hard work. I am a lazy person - when I entered into this industry, I thought it was a cakewalk, but I have realised it needs a lot of patience and hard work.","I tried to dance in my earlier films, but it was more like struggling to stay afloat once you are thrown into the water.","I've always been a huge fan of thrillers like David Fincher's 'Se7en.' I am fascinated by the disturbing, dark underbelly of life. I find such films deeply engrossing. They delve deep into the human psyche, and that's a place worth exploring.","Sometimes, I feel promoting a film is a more difficult task than acting!","I don't want to belong to any league. I am in a league of my own. I don't want any tags associated with me because I know when the media associates tags with you, they also have the power to remove those tags tomorrow.","Boldness, sensuality and an unapologetic way of showing things, that is part of my films.","My victory is when the audience buys a ticket to watch my film. I am extremely thrilled when they give it a thumbs-up.","An Emraan Hashmi film has come to guarantee certain ingredients: An intense, grey central character, a beautiful girl - if he gets lucky, then two - couple of kisses, a few bold scenes, fabulous music and a climatic twist.","My films have a bold interpretation. They are unapologetic about showing intimacy. Going by the number of people who come to watch my films, this is what our target audience yearns for.","As an actor, I was not accepted for the longest time. But it did not deter me, as the audience had accepted me. I never compared myself with any other actors. I never had any game plan and took whatever came my way.","The effort always remains that my new film outdoes my last in terms of performance and gets better box office success. Box office is the sole reason why I do films.","Sometimes I know a film might not pull the audience to the theatres and have a great collection at the box office. But I need to do these films for creative satisfaction and give something different to the audience.","Somewhere after you have few successful films, there is a fear of losing what you have got. It is very easy in the beginning, as you are a risk taker, have nothing to lose, and there is no perception about you.","I am not doing comedy because the genre is successful. If that was the case, I would have done a run-of-the-mill comedy film. I set my own trends. I like to give something new and different to my audiences. I want to do the kind of comedy that has been missing till now.","I have kissed in almost all the films except in 'Once Upon A Time In Mumbaai.' I'm not sure if my kissing on screen has anything to do with the success of a film, but producers make sure to put a kissing scene or two. They feel my kissing scenes are my lucky streak.","It is fun to see girls going mad about me or dancing around to get one glimpse of me. These are major perks of being an actor. But you need to be cautious and respectful.","Every married man who wants peace in the relationship, should learn the trick to avoid that one question - 'How is the food?'","I was an assistant director for a year, and I realized, 'God, this is a lot of hard work. This is going to take time. So what's the shortcut? What's the better option?' Then thankfully, someone said, 'Why don't you become an actor?'","I go for a couple of parties; you won't find me at every film party and never at award ceremonies. I tried attending for the first three to four years, and I've performed at award shows. I sat in them, and I've also exited pretty fast from them. It's just not my place. I'd rather get their adulation in a cinema hall.","I generally like grey roles. My interpretation of drama is different from the popular perception. Acting, for me, is not about overplaying, it is about concealing. I like flawed characters that people relate to. I would never do a romcom.","In my career, I have played a gangster, an ex cop, a journalist and a film director. Yet, the label of a serial kisser refuses to leave me.","I feel I should never do passive characters. They don't work for me.","When in college, I would hardly attend classes. In fact, we would go to other colleges and hang out there. Every six months, my friends and I would hit the roads and go to Goa. We weren't rich kids, and our trips were on shoestring budgets. But, we hardly cut down on the fun.","I did B com but realised that it was not my cup of tea. I was always fascinated by animation, and after I completed my course, I wanted to go abroad and pursue it. I used to sketch a lot and was rather serious about it. But all this was until I joined films.","Even as a child, when kids my age would watch cartoons, I preferred watching horror flicks. I had watched some Hollywood horror flicks and even films made by the Ramsay brothers by the time I was six! I have always been biased towards that genre.","After I tasted success with erotic thrillers, a time came when I was being offered only films belonging to that genre. The industry loves repeating a success formula, and the audience had formed a certain image of mine in their minds.","I was never really interested in studies and was hot-headed and rebellious in college, as I was totally confused and insecure but was not coming to terms with it.","I am not good at first or second impressions, and you have to spend some time with me to know me. Also, I don't want to put my best foot forward and prove something, as that is not me. I would rather be me and have you like me for who I am, instead of being someone else.","As for my looks, if I didn't look the way I do, I would probably be one of those many faces doing a romcom, which I detest. The way I look has somewhere defined the characters I played. My weakness has become my strength.","I never wanted to be in the show business. I wanted to do special effects.","I'm not meant to run around trees. I can't throw my arms in the air and sing, I find that boring and irritating. Sweet romcoms are not my cup of tea. The film has to be a little twisted and quirky.","I used to do films for money earlier. I never knew what perception meant. I didn't give too much attention to scripts. It was either to buy a house or to buy a car. There was a certain frivolity to the way I used to pick up things. I wasn't taking my career seriously.","You never compete with the people in your crew; you have your own team. Competition is only with those people whose film is releasing alongside on Friday and never with one's own team.","I've always been into visual effects. It was something I took keen interest in before films happened. Ironically, I am a part of 'Raaz 3,' a film that is shot entirely on 3D. It has encouraged me to pursue my dream. Hopefully, if time permits, I will travel to the United States and attend a crash course in visual graphics and animation.","I burned down my backyard as a seven-year-old. I poured kerosene over dried leaves and set the whole place on fire, just for fun. Yeah, not a very normal thing to do.","I don't know which other actor has done as many hot scenes as I have. I pretty much have the monopoly in the bed scene market in Bollywood.","If I am told to be at a shoot at 10 A.M., I am ready on time. By 11:30, I lose my patience. After that, I keep threatening to leave the sets if they don't begin soon. It works sometimes.","I find awards frivolous. When I began my career, I was told that I deserved an award for a certain performance, but then I couldn't turn up on the day of the show. Then I was told that the award went to someone else. That's when I realised the truth behind it all.","I don't want awards. I am not saying this like it's a case of sour grapes. It isn't. I have been to a couple of award functions, and I soon realised that it doesn't give me the kick that it does to others."],"Emun Elliott":["As an actor, you have to get used to being told no, develop a thick skin, and just keep persevering.","I'm still fighting for parts - it's not like I'm sitting with a big pile of scripts putting them in a 'yes' and 'no' pile.","It's more enjoyable when I'm disguised in some way; stepping into someone else's shoes is part of the reason why I became an actor.","I've played the violin since I was seven but stopped because there was a stage when it became 'uncool'. I was listening to Nirvana and wanted to play the guitar, so I ditched the violin.","It's a cliche, but John Lennon is my hero. He was so rebellious, so outspoken and so publicly opinionated, and I'm someone who's so private. I suppose you admire people who have the qualities you wish you had.","I had a Spider-man costume when I was about three, and I lost the mask. So I went to the underwear drawer and put a pair of red pants on my head. My dad came home and just laughed, and I ran into my room and burst into tears.","I'd like to enter in and out of that big budget world, rather than staying in it. It's not the case that the bigger the film, the better it is.","I prefer to think of myself as able to represent all walks of life.","I'd been wanting to work with James McAvoy since I was in drama school. I suppose there are parallels in that we're Scottish, we went to the same drama school and share the same agent, but aside from that, he's someone I've looked up to.","I'm definitely not your stereotypical actor: the loud, cackling type who strolls into a room and grabs everyone's attention with a great story. I've always been much more of a listener.","At school, I was a shy lad and still am. But acting gives me licence to be up there, demanding the focus. It's the one time in my life where I don't have to shout to be heard.","I actually wanted to be a forensic scientist for a while. When I was doing my Standard Grades, three of them were science subjects. The interest in science didn't wear off, but I found other interests.","Drama made me happy. Being on stage made me feel alive. But I did what a lot of people do, and that's follow this path of leaving school and going to university. It was only at university that I realised the only thing that would make me a satisfied man was to do what I loved."],"Enda Kenny":["Populist promises to reverse every tough decision are nothing but empty rhetoric, irresponsible leadership, and bad politics. They are not the solution to Ireland's problems.","Foreign investors like decisiveness; they like clarity. There isn't any confusion about Ireland's corporate tax rate: it is 12.5%. End of story.","My genuine belief is that if we can get through the eurozone crisis from a political point of view, we've got a lot of engines that can drive our economy, that will restore confidence and get us moving on.","I think - whether it's music, literature, sport, art, whatever you want - there's nobody who can stop us if we only apply ourselves with the singular objective of being the best in the world.","We have so much discrimination in this world - colour, race, creed, all of these things - and there is an issue here that the right of marriage in the civil law is not extended to same-sex couples.","Respectability in this country was a bad word because people did things who were in respected professions that let down the entire nation, and we're washing away their sins yet.","The revelations of the Cloyne report have brought the government, Irish Catholics, and the Vatican to an unprecedented juncture.","You have a responsibility as a locally elected deputy, but you also have a responsibility as the head of government.","It is the young people in whom I place my confidence because of their competence, because of their enthusiasm, because of their capacity to meet the frontiers that are changing every week.","Down the country, people in rural areas are struggling to get a speed of even 1 MB, not much better than the old dial-up system we used to have when the system was in relative infancy.","COP 21 provides a unique opportunity for the political leaders of this generation to provide lasting foundations for the preservation and sustainability of generations of the future.","Irish people are pragmatic. They understand that nobody is going to fix our problems but ourselves.","You see, in government, people give you a mandate, and you've got to fulfil that. Ours is very clear. Fix our public finances and get our country working.","My wife, Fionnuala, and I have been married for more than 20 years.","I'm a big fan of Springsteen. Obviously, his social commentary is very powerful for me. I like his album 'The Rising.' It's not a new one, but it sticks in my mind because of what it says to me.","The best recording is the one you bring with you in your mind.","One of the key drivers of Ireland's future is our balance of trade surplus.","For years, Ireland used to have a philosophy of 'Get them in here to invest and develop in Ireland, and this will sort out our problems.' It is good in the sense of building a trade surplus, but we also want to develop what it is that we offer ourselves and that Irish companies export abroad.","My job is to rectify the public finances and hand the country back to the people so they can really have a future, and that is what I will do.","Emigration is always a difficulty.","You're not going to be able to deliver jobs locally unless you sort out the nation's problems, and that's why the big and difficult decisions about Ireland's economy have been so crucial and so difficult for people to have to accept and have to deal with, but the reality is the people gave this government an unprecedented mandate.","Our revenue commissions are very happy and very clear that they showed no sweetheart deals and no preference for any company and never do and never have and never will.","We have a very long legal system with the European Union, and we're English speaking.","Ireland cannot become the collector general for the world. We can only tax on profits generated in the country here.","The world has changed utterly. There was a time when you couldn't marry a Protestant. There was a time when you got married that the women had to give up their job in the public service, and when they got married, they were owned by their husbands. That's all changed.","If somebody says, 'I am a gay person, and I want to get married,' is their own family going to deny them that? Are our own fellow citizens going to deny them that?","I am perfectly clear in my mind and in my conscience in respect of freedom of religious principles and beliefs.","I've often said it: that it is seen to be a place of energy, of excitement, of enthusiasm. That there's something about Ireland.","Rather than just saying, like, 'Your economy is the be all and end all,' I go back to my three roots that I've often said about this being best country for business, the best to raise a family in, and the best to grow old in with a sense of dignity and respect.","I am a big believer in Springsteen, I like his social comment; I like the commitment he puts into his work.","I enjoy his concerts and OK, maybe - I can't sing, I can't dance, I can't play the guitar, but I am going to go a long way if I keep following Springsteen.","Under no circumstances will I allow the Fianna Fail party back into government. They wrecked the economy twice.","I think 'austerity' is a much abused word. I prefer to call it 'fiscal discipline' or financial, 'financial competency.'","No politician in a European sense is happy with 26 million people unemployed. Nobody can be happy with 6 to 9 million young people unemployed. You have to give them hope and confidence and a sense of inspiration that the European process is actually about people, not about bureaucracy.","We've got enormous potential, phenomenal potential on our doorstep, which requires politics that makes that work, and that's what we try to show here in Ireland: that while there's a lot of pain, the reward at the end of this is career opportunities, prosperity, and brighter days for everybody.","People put dates on any kind of comment that you make.","If you were to do it again, you'd probably do some things differently. But the decision is right to have a single entity manage the water and the waste water for a country.","Conservation is important... water comes at a cost.","I intend to serve a full term as Taoiseach.","I would never accuse the Irish people of being in any way stupid.","I just think that the older you get, the more you appreciate the responsibility of politics.","My experience would say to me, never presume to have an answer to what the people are actually going to do.","I don't like to see people on trolleys in hospitals; I don't like to see old people sitting in chairs for hours.","I have no interest in the trappings of power.","There will be no hard border from Dundalk to Derry in the context of it being a European border, and by that I mean customs posts every mile along the road.","I don't take myself too seriously, but I take the job very seriously, and I expect people to do the job that they're given because this is about all our people, young and old, and it's an enormous responsibility.","What I do like is action, achievements, and results. Getting things done.","My job starts at a quarter to seven in the morning, and you go right through until whatever time is necessary to finish up.","You need to talk to people, and you need to hear what it is they have to say.","In Ireland here, the Revenue Commission have always been completely independent of the state since 1923, and they are quite adamant and quite clear that there was no preferential treatment and no special deals, no sweetheart deals, and that Apple paid the taxes that were due on their profits generated here in this country.","We link our future to the euro, to the euro zone, and to the European Union while being the nearest neighbor of the United Kingdom with, obviously, a common travel area and a very close working relationship with the U.K.","By 2007, an uncompetitive, bloated, over-borrowed and distorted Irish economy had been left at the mercy of subsequent international events without the safeguards, institutions, and mindset needed to survive and prosper as a small open economy inside the euro area.","I have never been on the trail of developers or contractors.","I didn't go on a campaign of developers asking, 'Please give me money.'","I now know what to do; I know how decisions can be made. I know how you can drive ministers and their departments to actually make decisions and bring results.","I get on very well with Denis Naughten, absolutely.","The Constitution says that the right to life of the unborn is protected and given equal rights as the life of the mother.","My relationship with Alan Shatter is a professional relationship: obviously worked with him over the years, complimented him for his work as a reforming minister, and move on.","We'll look after our hospitals. We'll look after our schools. We'll look after our infrastructure.","We'll look after the people who create jobs and business and give them that opportunity to grow in the time ahead.","I have never had an interest in opinion polls. They are merely an indicator, that's all.","To me, the real opinion polls are the tangible facts: the growing creation of jobs, the number of planning permissions, the number of commercial vans being sold - the signs that the Irish people are regaining confidence.","We are going to serve our full term; there will be no snap election, and we are going to do our best to ensure that 2016 is going to be a good economic year.","We have spent our time in government fixing the economy.","For me, it is all about people having jobs, and that is why I make no apology for having focused relentlessly on employment and job creation.","Sometimes in politics, you get a wallop in the electoral process.","I accept the verdict of the people.","The Seanad question was one element of a process of change and reform to politics that government has been pursuing.","If people want to follow an illusion that you don't have to pay your way, you don't have to measure up, then there are serious consequences for any country.","Failure to curb temperature increases will impact all countries, Ireland included, but with the most immediate and drastic effects being felt, in many instances, by the most vulnerable countries and communities.","I am proud that Ireland is playing its part to drive an ambitious and comprehensive agreement at COP21.","By far, the greatest contribution Ireland can make is to lead by example, by actively pursuing its own transition to a sustainable, low-carbon economy.","Irish research will contribute to global progress and have the potential to help all countries realise the potential of their land sectors in addressing climate change - this means reducing emissions, adapting to impacts, and enhancing and improving carbon sinks.","People tell me their own stories about how they have come through great difficulty.","People understand that you have to do difficult things to sort out our own public finances.","Cloyne's revelations are heart-breaking.","Clericalism has rendered some of Ireland's brightest, most privileged and powerful men either unwilling or unable to address the horrors cited in the Ryan and Murphy Reports.","For too long, Ireland has neglected its children.","Building on our strong track record of supporting developing countries, including in areas like climate justice, human rights, gender and education, Ireland recognises that vulnerable communities need very considerable assistance in adapting to climate change.","The decision of a majority of people in the United Kingdom to vote to leave the European Union is profoundly disappointing.","Our priority will be to look after the interests of our own country and its citizens.","As leader of the Fine Gael Party, I will also use our position in the European People's Party to clearly state our views with our European political partners.","We need to work together towards a mutually beneficial solution for Ireland, the U.K., and for Europe.","We must ensure that more binding, durable, and enforceable fiscal rules go hand-in-hand with funding certainty for countries pursuing sound and sustainable economic policies. We need to keep pushing forward towards a comprehensive solution to the challenges of the eurozone.","Public confidence in, and support for, the euro - and, indeed, the European Union - will ultimately be determined by how well we deliver on growth and jobs rather than on institutional wrangling and complex legal or technical negotiations.","The E.U. needs renewal, and we need a strong U.K. at the table to help to drive the reform agenda that can help the union regain competitiveness and growth.","The U.K. and Ireland are like-minded on E.U. matters, and the process of working together in Brussels has built an immense store of knowledge, personal relationships, and trust between our governments.","Our common membership of the E.U. provided an important external context to the Irish and U.K. governments working together for peace. It should not be discounted lightly.","The re-establishment of a hard border on the island of Ireland would be a step backwards and present an opportunity for others, with malign agendas, to exploit for destructive purposes.","It is about time county councils got back into the business of providing houses.","The lion's share of the damage to the Irish economy was the fault of domestic, economic, and financial mismanagement."],"Enid Bagnold":["In marriage there are no manners to keep up, and beneath the wildest accusations no real criticism. Each is familiar with that ancient child in the other who may erupt again. We are not ridiculous to ourselves. We are ageless. That is the luxury of the wedding ring.","If a dog doesn't put you first where are you both? In what relation? A dog needs God. It lives by your glances, your wishes. It even shares your humor. This happens about the fifth year. If it doesn't happen you are only keeping an animal.","When a man goes through six years training to be a doctor he will never be the same. He knows too much.","Judges don't age; time decorates them.","A father is always making his baby into a little woman. And when she is a woman he turns her back again.","As for death one gets used to it, even if it's only other people's death you get used to.","The pleasure of one's effect on other people still exists in age - what's called making a hit. But the hit is much rarer and made of different stuff.","The theatre is a gross art, built in sweeps and over-emphasis. Compromise is its second name."],"Enid Blyton":["I have written, probably, more books for children than any other writer, from story-books to plays, and can claim to know more about interesting children than most.","Writing for children is an art in itself, and a most interesting one.","If one can judge from the letters that I receive, it would seem that there are many thousands of children who would like me to speak or to read to them.","We must have Christian ethics for our children, good and strong, but we must make them attractive, too, and it can be done.","My work in books, films and talks lies almost wholly with children, and I have very little time to give to grown-ups.","I am not really much interested in talking to adults, although I suppose practically every mother in the kingdom knows my name and my books. It's their children I love.","I get over a hundred letters a day from all over the world, from children and parents, and it's a wonder I ever have time to write books, let alone speak!"],"Enid Nemy":["Even at the United Nations, where legend has it that the building was designed so that there could be no corner offices, the expanse of glass in individual offices is said to be a dead giveaway as to rank. Five windows are excellent, one window not so great.","Windows are as essential to office prestige as Christmas is to retailing."],"Ennio Doris":["Mediobanca is undervalued but less undervalued than other banks.","The 2012 payout will be the lowest in our history: well below 50 percent."],"Ennio Morricone":["I was offered a free villa in Hollywood, but I said no thank you, I prefer to live in Italy.","You can see my decision as either a distinctive factor or as a limitation. I don't feel it is a limitation.","Bernard Herrmann used to write all his scores by himself. So did Bach, Beethoven and Stravinsky. I don't understand why this happens in the movie industry.","It had a very good arrangement by Herbie Hancock, but it used existing pieces.","There was a theft! But, of course, if it was up to me, every two years I would win an Oscar.","I come from a background of experimental music which mingled real sounds together with musical sounds.","I also used these realistic sounds in a psychological way. With The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, I used animal sounds - as you say, the coyote sound - so the sound of the animal became the main theme of the movie."],"Enoch Powell":["If my ship sails from sight, it doesn't mean my journey ends, it simply means the river bends.","No battle is worth fighting except the last one.","I will not surrender responsibility for my life and my actions.","To write a diary every day is like returning to one's own vomit.","When I repress my emotion my stomach keeps score.","If I cannot understand my friend's silence, I will never get to understand his words.","History is littered with wars which everybody knew would never happen.","I do not keep a diary.

I ran everywhere I went."],"Enric Sala":["The seas need their own Kyoto Protocol.","The ocean is like a checking account where everybody withdraws but nobody makes a deposit. This is what's happening because of overfishing.","I dream of diving in two places where I have not been yet. One is Antarctica, because of its crystal clear waters and amazing fauna, in addition to the ice cathedrals. The other is the Arctic, where I'd like to see the northernmost kelp forests.","When I was a kid, Jacques Cousteau was my hero and the person who inspired me to become an underwater explorer. I have many other people who inspired me after him, but he is still my all-time hero.","A marine ecologist is a scientist who studies the many species that live underwater and how they interact with each other and with humans.","Sometimes I think I don't need a vacation because I do what I like to do. I am very fortunate!","I have touched coral, and it feels hard like a rock, with a little slimy thing on top of it. But it is better to not touch coral, to prevent damaging it.","The Ocean Health Index is like the thermometer of the ocean. It will allow us to take the temperature to know what is going on at the global level, trying to integrate different impacts, including overfishing, invasive species, coastal development, and climate change.","Fish banks are areas we set aside without fishing, reserves where we allow marine life to come back."],"Enrico Caruso":["I never step upon a stage without asking myself whether I will succeed in finishing the opera. The fact is that a conscientious singer is never sure of himself or of anything. He is ever in the hands of Destiny.","To become a singer requires work, work, and again, work! It need not be in any special corner of the earth; there is no one spot that will do more for you than other places. It doesn't matter so much where you are if you have intelligence and a good ear.","I know that I am a singer and an actor, yet in order to give the public the impression that I am neither one nor the other, but the real man conceived by the author, I have to feel and to think as the man the author had in mind.","It was he who impressed, time and again, the necessity of singing as nature intended, and - I remember - he constantly warned, don't let the public know that you work. So I went slowly. I never forced the voice.","It is too bad that the public expects from me, always, perfection which it is impossible for me always to attain. I am not a machine. I am a human being.","I had always sung, as far back as I can remember, for the pure love of it. My voice was contralto, and I sang in a church in Naples from fourteen till I was eighteen.","The fact that I could secure an opera engagement made me realize I had within me the making of an artist, if I would really labor for such an end. When I became thoroughly convinced of this, I was transformed from an amateur into a professional in a single day."],"Enrico Colantoni":["I believe that no one can teach you how to act, but schools do give you an environment to make mistakes, to learn techniques and to learn professionalism.","It's like watching a car accident, that reality TV.","I never get tired of talking about 'Galaxy Quest.' I am so proud of that movie. Our only fear was that we were having so much fun making the movie we got concerned it might not be as good as we thought it was going to be.","School is very important; it was very important for me. It gave me an enormous amount of confidence, especially at Yale where we were dealing with all the classics. In dealing with the classics, you are dealing with the very best.","I really appreciate an actor who has paid their dues and who has learned hard knocks and has been rewarded in the end.","If actors could actually make a living doing theater, that would be my first choice. Sitcoms are the closest thing to being onstage in front of an audience.","I really appreciate an actor who has paid their dues and who has learned hard knocks and has been rewarded in the end. I don't understand young actors who get off the turnip truck and land in Hollywood and get a great job. They do not realize how fortunate they are.","If actors could actually make a living doing theater, that would be my first choice. Sitcoms are the closest thing to being onstage in front of an audience. If I had to choose, it would be theater and doing the occasional movie once in a while, and spending time doing nothing.","Everybody remembers 'Just Shoot Me,' and I'm very proud of that. It's still on TV, and people still catch it and laugh about it, and I personally have wonderful, wonderful memories working with those people.","I know that any fan of 'Veronica Mars' is hardcore and loyal, so I give them the time; we spend time talking about it because it warrants that.","Style equals pretense.","I'd love to teach theatre arts.","You know what, I'm a big, big fan of 'Heroes,' but the day they told me that the end of the world was coming, and that day didn't come, I stopped watching.","I'm a hockey fan; I watch hockey, and I listen to the news.","I'd love to be on a show like 'ER.' Just watching it is like, 'Phew.' I loved watching 'Veronica Mars.' 'Buffy' was a big... I loved 'Buffy.' I would go out of my way to watch 'Buffy.'","We watch so many TV shows and movies about jaded or corrupt policemen, we forget people join the police force to do good, and they really care about that.","I'd make a lousy cop. I'd just wear it too close to my skin and wouldn't survive. I'll stick to acting.","In Toronto, I grew up taking a subway, I grew up taking a bus. I spent my formative adult years in New York City, walking the streets, taking the subway. You're connected to the larger whole. L.A. is so spread out, and you're so incubated inside those cars and it's so exhausting to deal with the traffic, without really having the human contact.","From Italy, I'd get calls from cousins and aunts saying, 'I don't think you should act. It's really tough. What are the chances?' This was around the time 'Flashdance' came out, and I was like, 'What about your dreams? I'm a maniac.'"],"Enrico Fermi":["There are two possible outcomes: if the result confirms the hypothesis, then you've made a measurement.

I have a salary as member of parliament. I don't want a double salary. So it was a very important decision.","To see how many Italians are going out of Italy, the sort of exodus, a great generation leaving my country, I think is the worst nightmare for me as prime minister but also for the country, of course.","The very things that I would love about Barack and that you would love about Barack is that he is one of us. He's a normal guy. He's not a political animal.","Today, parliaments are more important because of the need of legitimacy, of the popular legitimacy, of public opinion legitimacy of politics. Parliaments are, at the end of the day, the only true legitimacy.","My goal and mission is to be very strong in avoiding back steps. I leave judgments, evaluations and analysis to the media, then to the observers."],"Enrique Iglesias":["I wouldn't change anything. I've made mistakes, but thanks to those mistakes, I've learned.","My best personality trait that I think I'm very approachable. And my worst is that I can be moody.","The power of music in Spanish is so strong, that I couldn't stay away from it any longer.","I'm a good person, but with many defects.","I know it sounds corny, but when you follow your dreams, it happens. And if it's music, take it seriously.","Love is one of my main inspirations.","The way I look at it, I'd rather make my own mistakes than have people make them for me.","When I'm in love, I wake up happy.","Realistically, English is a universal language; it's the number one language for music and for communicating with the rest of the world.","I don't sleep much.

White lies, basically.","My inspiration are the woman, friendship, and loneliness.","My tennis skills are okay.","I'm so proud of who I am and where I come from and who my father is.","Yes, I have made a woman cry.","I mean, if you turn on the radio, love is 90 percent of the music.","I don't care what people say. My music's, my music.","I care about politics just like any other citizen. I'm against the war in Iraq, or any type of war.","There are days that I wake up and I complain, and when I complain I pinch myself and say, 'that's for complaining.' Not many people can do what they really like in life.","I'm quite grounded.","I was happier before, when I lead a normal life.","I always respect a woman.","I prefer love over sex.","I really want to fall in love.","I'm very romantic.","We all feel love, and that might sound kind of corny, but I really feel that's what joins musicians together around the world.","Yeah, exactly, you can talk about politics in music, you can talk about something else, but that's always going to change, and love is never going to change.","And people coming up asking for autographs, there's only one time when it kind of bothers me: when I'm eating.","If you're buying an album because of the face on it, you're stupid.","If you come from Spain, you have to play football.","There hasn't been one moment in my career where I felt I didn't have any control over the creative aspects of my records.","The only thing I have no control over is the politics that goes on within the record company. It's always been the same, but it's far tougher now, because record companies are run by financial people; before, they were run by creative people.","The one thing I've learned in the last ten years is that successful artists don't get paid to write and sing songs, they get paid for the psychological roller coaster they're going to have to ride. That's the hard work.","If they would have told me when I was just 18 that I was going to have a career that would last so long, I'd have said it was impossible, that it was crazy that that could happen in my life, so I'm happy to be here. To be able to go out on stage every day.","As an artist, I've been very fortunate.","My motivations are thinking I can write better songs, that the concerts can be better.","I've worked a lot during the night.

Its own context makes it a very competitive country, but I believe that if we recognize how interdependent the U.S. with its neighbors from the North and the South, we are part of NAFTA, a trade agreement.","Mexico has shelters, which care for children trying to cross the border, who have no company with them.","U.S. politicians are increasingly recognizing the relevance of the Hispanic vote in U.S. politics.","Whenever there are some who have more opportunities than others, this feeds corruption.","Without better economic opportunity, you can't have better public security and vice versa.","Do you agree that when there's tension and an obsession to want to hit the ball is when you hit it worst? You have to be loose.","I will be the government of increasing economic growth and creating jobs.

I propose changing Mexico.","Free trade, far from protectionism, is the path that we should take to make Latin America a thriving actor in the global economy.","Mexico holds the fifth-largest shale gas reserve in the world, in addition to large deep-water oil reserves and a tremendous potential in renewable energy.","I'm not going to work so that Pena Nieto is the best known or most recognized in the world. I'm going to work so that Mexico has results.","I believe the state needs to control hydrocarbons.","There are many commitments I have made for reducing poverty. One is to reform social security. Social security reaches only 44 percent of Mexicans. One of my goals is to give social security to all the people.","There is an opportunity to consolidate the North American region as a more competitive region, a more productive region that will be more competitive than other blocs that have integrated in the rest of the world.","My interest is to establish an agenda of engagement with Mexicans that will respond to Mexicans' most urgent needs.","There is no doubt a president has to govern for everyone.","If I'm the president, I will call in all the different political opinions to come together and to make one front to the benefit of Mexico.","I think money laundering is giving oxygen to organized crime.","The state is obliged to fight corruption within the government.","Ah, 'The Departed' is really good.","The route of expropriation, and especially in energy matters, is not what most promotes investment or generates greater confidence.","There are still states that have not evolved so much as California, that still skimp on recognition and, even worse, the rights of immigrants.","We should reconsider greater integration of North America to achieve a region that is more competitive and capable of creating more jobs.","The United States is already Mexico's largest trading partner.","I plan to open Mexico's energy sector to national and foreign private investment.","More than 1 million U.S. citizens live in Mexico, and my country remains the largest source of immigrants to the United States.","Together we are building a new Mexico.","Mexico has acquired unique experience during its integration into global value chains, especially in the automotive industry.","Mexico has not achieved the advances that the population demands or deserves.","I will run an open government that speaks with honesty, seeks opinion, listens to its citizens.","I will be a president who is close to the people.","Do not have any doubt that I will apply the law over whoever is responsible for not complying with the law.","Mexico has experimented with political change since the late 1980s.","You can't consider a president weak because he will have a Congress that Mexican voters have wanted to be co-responsible in the decisions to be taken... It will be through the leadership that I will exercise that we will be able to build the agreements in Congress.","There have been no voices against the structural reforms that I have proposed, especially the energy reform.","There are a great number of Mexicans who live every day worried about the lack of employment and opportunities. Those conditions also damage the image of Mexico abroad, and that is the Mexico that must be transformed.","My government's first aim will be to bring peace to Mexico.","I have a hard time recalling the titles of books.","Mexico urgently needs a series of structural reforms that will detonate its true economic potential and generate more public welfare.","I want to initiate a bilateral agenda that helps Mexico and the U.S. together compete with the world better, especially with the economies of Asia and the Pacific.","One of the big goals of my administration will be to reposition Mexico again as an emerging power.","Mexico is the second most important destination of U.S. exports. What does this mean? The U.S. sells to our country almost the same as it sells to all the European Union, five times what it sells Brazil. More than what it sells together to Brazil, Russia, China, and India.","Each dollar Mexico exports to the U.S. has a content of American production of 40¢.","I'm not driving to be a popular president.","The level of credit in Mexico has shown to be low. And where credit concentrates the most favors large corporations and not companies.","I believe that Mexico, geographically, is located in a privileged position. We serve as the meeting point with North America and the rest of Latin America.","Every time you go for more competition, some people don't like it, but that's the way it is.","Pemex becomes a productive company of the state, but it will have competition and can make associations with the private sector.","There is no evidence that terrorists use Mexico to cross into the United States. There have been comments to that regard, but not one of those statements has contained hard evidence.","Pemex will remain 100 percent Mexican.","I believe the conditions are very favorable for Mexico to grow. I'm very optimistic.","I may not remember the name of a book's author, but let it be clear, what I will not forget is the violence, the poverty and the desperation that Mexico is living through.","My only definition is that I am a pragmatist.","Mexico has perhaps, in some ways, a good practice, in which it has officials devoted precisely to hold those children, to retain those children that are crossing through our territory, who are coming from Central America.","Once every 12 years there is a unique opportunity to reinforce the bonds between Mexico and the United States, when our presidential election cycles coincide.","Acting aggressively will allow our youth to aspire for better-paid jobs and find alternatives to criminality.","We have been using foreign affairs ministries to address security issues, but this practice is outdated. It's time to assign the handling of regional security to national organizations and expert institutions.","By increasing productivity and becoming more competitive, we will be able to offer better opportunities and improve the standard of living for all Mexicans.","The North American Free Trade Agreement marked a fundamental change in the global trade scheme.","If we don't make sure that Mexico can offer potential investors more input, they'll stop coming to Mexico. They'll go to the United States or other places where it is more economically viable to carry out their projects.","In terms of the espionage, this is something I have talked to President Obama about. We don't want it to mar the relationship between Mexico and the United States. But it is unacceptable for a country to practice such espionage, especially if there is a good relationship with the other country.","I really don't like to read.","Politics is an instrument that can transform society.","What Mexico City cannot do and my country cannot do is to allow us to be intimidated, the authorities to be intimidated, by organized crime.","Mexico is a safe country.","Mexico has proven by now that it's a strong electoral democracy. Now we have to build a democracy that produces better results; if not, then you get a democracy of disenchantment.","To get elected in Mexico today, you have to compete like any democracy, and you don't do that by being manipulated.","I will maintain the presence of a Mexican Army, and the Navy and police in the states of the Mexican Republic, where the problem of crime has increased.","I see myself as a family man.","I have publicly talked about Mexico's need to open ourselves up to the participation of the private sector in the energy sector, however this doesn't mean privatizing state-run companies.","Politics and more politics - that's how you work towards the building of agreements.","I think it is fundamental to understand that the ethics of politics indicate that you should concentrate your efforts on those marginalized people who live in poverty with few opportunities to develop individually.","I love to go to Acapulco with my family.","One single visit is not enough to be able to say that you know Mexico.","I have read a number of books, starting with novels, that I particularly liked.","It's obvious that Pemex doesn't have the financial capacity to be in every single front of energy generation.","I believe immigration reform is a commitment of President Obama's government, especially since it gives him a chance to respond to the great demand expressed by U.S. Hispanic voters.","The coalition is a model that has no place in a presidential regime such as in Mexico. It fits in parliamentary models, but Mexico has a presidential regime.","Society judges political parties based on the results that they give. When they don't meet the population's needs, when they are not up to expectations, that leaves society free to pick other parties.","Mexico has lost its leadership, and a lot of that has to do with its poor performance and the lack of better results in our country.","Mexico cannot put up with this scenario of death and kidnapping."],"Enrique Vila-Matas":["I long to journey endlessly, always in search of something new. Always alert.","As I write, I control my anxiety and anguish thanks to the invaluable aid of irony and humor. But every night I am subdued by an anxiety that knows no irony, and I must wait until the next day to rediscover the blend of anguish and humor that characterizes my writing and that generates my style.","When it grows dark, we always need someone. This thought, the product of anxiety, only comes to me in the evenings, just when I'm about to end my writerly explorations."],"Enya":["The spring, summer, is quite a hectic time for people in their lives, but then it comes to autumn, and to winter, and you can't but help think back to the year that was, and then hopefully looking forward to the year that is approaching.","The ocean is a central image. It is the symbolism of a great journey.","My core beliefs revolve around the idea that we should live to the best of our abilities-we should live and let live.","I am not reclusive. I just have a private life.","There is no formula to it. Writing every song is a little journey. The first note has to lift you.","When I was growing up, I'd be in the choir. My mum was the organist in the church, so I'd sing in the church.","I can only be who I am.","Fame and success are very different things.","With my music, I can express myself so much. A lot of the fans can sense that I'm relating to them something that's quite personal.","The writing of a melody is an emotional moment; success doesn't make it easy.","I do understand that not everyone is going to sit and listen to an Enya album. When someone says it's not their cup of tea, it's not their kind of album, that's fine by me.","Writing music on your own makes you think a lot about your life. Who are you? Would you change anything about yourself? This is where it comes from.","As with anything creative, change is inevitable.","When making music I sink myself into the process as deeply as I can and forget all of the success.","The success of Watermark surprised me. I never thought of music as something commercial; it was something very personal to me.","The personal appearances and red carpet events are very glitzy, but it's a bit false.","The music sold itself before anybody knew who I was.","The minuses of celebrity include having to live with security and the knowledge that you may be stalked.","The Druids held the trees as very sacred.","Singing in Gaelic is very, very natural to do. I think lends itself very much so to being sung.","People tend to think that because I need all this time on my own in the studio, that I need time on my own, period. And that's not really true.","Over in the UK, the music press can be brutal. They can say wonderful things about you one week, and the next week, you're in the can.","My first language is Gaelic.","It's very homely, this castle. It doesn't have huge ballrooms. I didn't want a cold, cavernous place.","It wasn't so long ago that it was not popular to speak Gaelic in Ireland because the areas that Gaelic is spoken in were much poorer areas.","I'm not one for walking the beaches humming a melody. I love the discipline of sitting in the studio, writing and listening. That is my domain.","I use my voice as an instrument.","I told the record company I didn't feel the need to be at red-carpet events. I wanted a career. But I wanted to keep myself intact as a person.","I tend to listen to the classical composers: Rachmaninov, Satie.","I know every note in every song, the whole history of it, even parts that were there and are gone.","I have had death threats from people with fixations.","I enjoyed the two years I was with Clannad. I enjoyed touring. We toured a lot in Europe.","I don't need a man in my life.","I don't have pets, I have two guard dogs; and I don't do my own shopping; it's a security thing.","I do promotion when it is necessary, but I always want to get back to the music.","I do a so-called trip into myself: I sit down at the piano and the melody might start to evolve from my playing or then I might start to sing it.","I didn't expect such a huge reaction, but I knew I was doing something different to everything else that was happening at the time.","I could have been more famous if I did all the glitzy things, but celebrity always seemed so unnecessary.","I am really a very shy person. If I appear, it is because of the music, not because I want to be seen.","I am privileged to do a job I love to do. I would never change any moment from my life.","I find that music makes people just sit and listen, firstly. Then, they seem to interpret their own emotions with the music and it makes them ponder their own life a lot. And then they start to question: Am I happy in my work? Am I happy in my relationships? What am I striving for?","It's a noisy environment we all live in, whether it's traffic or the workplace, so it's very difficult to think about your life in general. A lot of people are afraid to do that. They like to hide behind their work and not face up to a big problem in their life.","The fans are very, very loyal. They're always saying, 'When is the next album?' They know when I finish in the studio it's got to be a few years before the next album.","I always felt that the music sells by itself. The music has always been the successful aspect on my career, and that means that, to me, I can always still stay very focused on music.","Wintertime for me is a time when I do a lot of my writing in the studio. It's a time I enjoy. And it's very reflective and a very calming time of the year. Throughout the year I gather a lot of musical inspirations, and this is where I bring them to the studio and see what will evolve musically.","It's very easy for me to keep a low profile because the focus I feel is always on the music. Success and fame are two different things. And so I feel the success is always towards the music, which means that I can have a very normal and private lifestyle.","When you spend two to three years working on an album that I feel very happy with the end result, there is nothing I would change. Musically, I have achieved what I set out to do.","I find I'm not one of these composers that are, you know, walking along a beach or walking on the mountainside in County Donegal that's, you know, 'Oh, a melody.' It's more a matter of eventually taking that moment with me to the studio, and it begins to evolve."],"Enzo Ferrari":["The fact is I don't drive just to get from A to B. I enjoy feeling the car's reactions, becoming part of it.","If you can dream it, you can do it.","Racing is a great mania to which one must sacrifice everything, without reticence, without hesitation.","The era of gentleman racing drivers is ended.","I build engines and attach wheels to them.","I believe most things can be said in a few lines.","Aerodynamics are for people who can't build engines.","One must keep working continuously; otherwise, one thinks of death.","But each time I seemed to be climbing into a roller coaster and finding myself coming through the downhill run with that sort of dazed feeling that we all know.","Racing amuses me.","I have never gone on a real trip, never taken a holiday. The best holiday for me is spent in my workshops when nearly everybody else is on vacation.","The client is not always right.","I have yet to meet anyone quite so stubborn as myself and animated by this overpowering passion that leaves me no time for thought or anything else. I have, in fact, no interest in life outside racing cars.","It's true that I have never met any man whom I thought altogether resembled me - but only because my faults are so enormous."],"Eoin Colfer":["The thing about reading is that if you are hooked, you're not going to stop just because one series is over; you're going to go and find something else.","When I went to school, I was already reading and writing. In fact, I was offended that the other kids couldn't.","What many people don't know about 'Peter Pan' is that it's a very violent book and Hook is one of the most finely observed villains ever.","I do like to read in bed, but because I have two kids I'm often forced to read in the bathroom.","I often meet frustrated young writers who say they've only got so far and just can't finish a book. Even if you don't happen to use what you've worked on that day, it has taught you something and you'll be amazed when you might come back to it and use it again.","I have a lovely office at the back of my house; it's an old stable and you can see right out to the countryside on one side and into the house on the other side.","I have always loved 'Stig of the Dump.' I think reading that book made me officially realise that I was a reader.","I am perhaps unusual in that I came to 'Doctor Who' through the numerous novelisations and not through the television show."],"Ephraim Mirvis":["The Holocaust remains unique in contemporary Jewish consciousness for its capacity to engender the most visceral grief and abject pain.","While silence can in some circumstances bespeak noble self-control, it can also signify suppression, oblivion or cowardice.","Anti-Semitism is not just a problem for Jews; it is a problem for all of our society.","Let no Jew, regardless of their circumstances, feel that he or she cannot experience that unique moment of peace when Shabbat begins.","Anyone who truly understands what apartheid was cannot possibly look around Israel today and honestly claim there is any kind of parity.","We protest to our last breath against the purveyors of hatred, cruelty and violence.","We must teach compassion and tolerance and encourage kindness, selflessness, and loving acceptance of all who are created in the image of God.","Open a Jewish daily prayer book used in any part of the world, and Zionism will leap out at you.","Life has an absolute value and its preservation takes precedence over other commandments.","Free speech may be a right, but only by using it as a force for good in the world do we make it a virtue.","As we wander, grieving, in yet another dark moment, amid our pain we must struggle to remember the redemptive power of love and hope.","My track record is that I have always sought to work with warmth and in a constructive way with the leaders of other components of the Jewish faith.","The rabbis will find in me personally someone who cares about their future and welfare.","'Rabbi' means 'teacher,' and I see the role of chief rabbi as chief teacher.","The beth din is the court of the chief rabbi. I see myself taking an active role within the beth din.","Britain has been good to the Jews, and the Jews have been good for Britain.","I feel very privileged indeed to be appointed to be the next Chief Rabbi.","Shimon Peres was the greatest living example of an unshakable belief in the pursuit of peace against all odds.","All political parties share in the responsibility to rid our society of anti-Semitism, but we cannot achieve that objective with political posturing or empty promises of action never to be fulfilled.","Jews are frequently compared to the proverbial 'canary in the coal mine,' an enduring signal for when the world is failing to meet its obligations in tackling bigotry. It has never been clearer to me just how widely understood that truism is.","Ethics, politics and psychology are all far more difficult to understand now that we know the depths to which human nature can sink.","Human beings are partners of the Almighty in bringing life into the world, and we are his partners also in healing.","In the face of death, we will continue to choose and sanctify life.","I was honoured recently to accept the position of president of Mizrachi U.K. I did so because I believe our eternal challenge as Jews is both straightforward and also awash with complexity: How to sanctify the innovations of the modern world in accordance with our eternal Jewish values?","Holocaust denial, once the preserve of fringe conspiracy theorists, has mutated into Holocaust obfuscation, equivocation, and specious comparison on a larger scale than ever.","When someone denies the right of Israel to exist, it hurts us, just as an attack on a close member of our family would hurt us.","Words make a world of difference. Over time, they become charged with inference and allusion and, deployed effectively, they have the power to change the very fabric of our civilisation.","All societies wrestle with the scourge of prejudice, but validating that prejudice in statute makes a virtue of oppression."],"Epictetus":["The key is to keep company only with people who uplift you, whose presence calls forth your best.","We have two ears and one mouth so that we can listen twice as much as we speak.","Keep silence for the most part, and speak only when you must, and then briefly.","It's not what happens to you, but how you react to it that matters.","Wealth consists not in having great possessions, but in having few wants.","People are not disturbed by things, but by the view they take of them.","It takes more than just a good looking body. You've got to have the heart and soul to go with it.","Difficulties are things that show a person what they are.","First learn the meaning of what you say, and then speak.","We should not moor a ship with one anchor, or our life with one hope.","If you want to improve, be content to be thought foolish and stupid.","There is only one way to happiness and that is to cease worrying about things which are beyond the power of our will.","Make the best use of what is in your power, and take the rest as it happens.","When you are offended at any man's fault, turn to yourself and study your own failings. Then you will forget your anger.","Men are disturbed not by things, but by the view which they take of them.","The greater the difficulty the more glory in surmounting it. Skillful pilots gain their reputation from storms and tempests.","Freedom is the right to live as we wish.","All religions must be tolerated... for every man must get to heaven in his own way.","If you wish to be a writer, write.","If thy brother wrongs thee, remember not so much his wrong-doing, but more than ever that he is thy brother.","If one oversteps the bounds of moderation, the greatest pleasures cease to please.","If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.","Nothing great is created suddenly, any more than a bunch of grapes or a fig. If you tell me that you desire a fig. I answer you that there must be time. Let it first blossom, then bear fruit, then ripen.","It is impossible to begin to learn that which one thinks one already knows.","Only the educated are free.","Be careful to leave your sons well instructed rather than rich, for the hopes of the instructed are better than the wealth of the ignorant.","If you desire to be good, begin by believing that you are wicked.","One that desires to excel should endeavor in those things that are in themselves most excellent.","Freedom is not procured by a full enjoyment of what is desired, but by controlling the desire.","If evil be spoken of you and it be true, correct yourself, if it be a lie, laugh at it.","No great thing is created suddenly.","Do not laugh much or often or unrestrainedly.","Do not seek to bring things to pass in accordance with your wishes, but wish for them as they are, and you will find them.","It is the nature of the wise to resist pleasures, but the foolish to be a slave to them.","It is not he who reviles or strikes you who insults you, but your opinion that these things are insulting.","Is freedom anything else than the right to live as we wish? Nothing else.","If you seek truth you will not seek victory by dishonorable means, and if you find truth you will become invincible.","No man is free who is not master of himself.","Know, first, who you are, and then adorn yourself accordingly.","First say to yourself what you would be; and then do what you have to do.","Silence is safer than speech.","To accuse others for one's own misfortunes is a sign of want of education. To accuse oneself shows that one's education has begun. To accuse neither oneself nor others shows that one's education is complete.","Neither should a ship rely on one small anchor, nor should life rest on a single hope.","Imagine for yourself a character, a model personality, whose example you determine to follow, in private as well as in public.","The two powers which in my opinion constitute a wise man are those of bearing and forbearing.","The essence of philosophy is that a man should so live that his happiness shall depend as little as possible on external things.","He is a wise man who does not grieve for the things which he has not, but rejoices for those which he has.","We are not to give credit to the many, who say that none ought to be educated but the free; but rather to the philosophers, who say that the well-educated alone are free.","He is a drunkard who takes more than three glasses though he be not drunk.","Whenever you are angry, be assured that it is not only a present evil, but that you have increased a habit.","Whoever does not regard what he has as most ample wealth, is unhappy, though he be master of the world.","No greater thing is created suddenly, any more than a bunch of grapes or a fig. If you tell me that you desire a fig, I answer you that there must be time. Let it first blossom, then bear fruit, then ripen.","You are a little soul carrying around a corpse.","The world turns aside to let any man pass who knows where he is going.","It is not death or pain that is to be dreaded, but the fear of pain or death.","Unless we place our religion and our treasure in the same thing, religion will always be sacrificed.","Never in any case say I have lost such a thing, but I have returned it. Is your child dead? It is a return. Is your wife dead? It is a return. Are you deprived of your estate? Is not this also a return?","You may be always victorious if you will never enter into any contest where the issue does not wholly depend upon yourself.","God has entrusted me with myself.","There is nothing good or evil save in the will.","Practice yourself, for heaven's sake in little things, and then proceed to greater.","Not every difficult and dangerous thing is suitable for training, but only that which is conducive to success in achieving the object of our effort.","All philosophy lies in two words, sustain and abstain.","We tell lies, yet it is easy to show that lying is immoral.","Control thy passions lest they take vengence on thee."],"Epicurus":["Do not spoil what you have by desiring what you have not; remember that what you now have was once among the things you only hoped for.","Not what we have But what we enjoy, constitutes our abundance.","Of all the things which wisdom provides to make us entirely happy, much the greatest is the possession of friendship.","Death does not concern us, because as long as we exist, death is not here. And when it does come, we no longer exist.","A free life cannot acquire many possessions, because this is not easy to do without servility to mobs or monarchs.","If God listened to the prayers of men, all men would quickly have perished: for they are forever praying for evil against one another.","We must exercise ourselves in the things which bring happiness, since, if that be present, we have everything, and, if that be absent, all our actions are directed toward attaining it.","It is impossible to live a pleasant life without living wisely and well and justly. And it is impossible to live wisely and well and justly without living a pleasant life.","Nothing is enough for the man to whom enough is too little.","It is better for you to be free of fear lying upon a pallet, than to have a golden couch and a rich table and be full of trouble.","We do not so much need the help of our friends as the confidence of their help in need.","It is possible to provide security against other ills, but as far as death is concerned, we men live in a city without walls.","Justice... is a kind of compact not to harm or be harmed.","There is no such thing as justice in the abstract; it is merely a compact between men.","The art of living well and the art of dying well are one.","It is not so much our friends' help that helps us, as the confidence of their help.","The time when most of you should withdraw into yourself is when you are forced to be in a crowd.","The misfortune of the wise is better than the prosperity of the fool.","I never desired to please the rabble. What pleased them, I did not learn; and what I knew was far removed from their understanding.","If thou wilt make a man happy, add not unto his riches but take away from his desires.","Both old and young alike ought to seek wisdom: the former in order that, as age comes over him, he may be young in good things because of the grace of what has been, and the latter in order that, while he is young, he may at the same time be old, because he has no fear of the things which are to come.","It is folly for a man to pray to the gods for that which he has the power to obtain by himself.","Misfortune seldom intrudes upon the wise man; his greatest and highest interests are directed by reason throughout the course of life.","Let no one be slow to seek wisdom when he is young nor weary in the search of it when he has grown old.

At the beginning of college, I had this illusion, which was kind of silly in retrospect, that if I just understood math and physics and philosophy, I could figure out everything else from first principles.","I don't view myself as a practitioner of a particular skill or method. I'm constantly looking at what's the most interesting problem that I could possibly work on. I really try to figure out what sort of scientist I need to be in order to solve the problem I'm interested in solving.","Much of contemporary science is really the length and shadow of the technology we apply.","The immune system constantly creates genes on the fly that are specific to the things that show up in the body. It's amazing.","The best types of problems are those that seem harder at first than when you think about it.","It's so hard to figure out what's going on in biological systems. You just can't see them.","There was a period in my life when I was eating ramen non-stop. These days, less so. Once you have a kid, you end up eating a lot of foods with broccoli in them.","One of the central mysteries of biology is why the genome is largely identical from cell to cell, even though cells do different things.","My wife and I started a program called Bears Without Borders.

It was fun to watch the rocket blast into the air, suspenseful to wonder if the parachute would open to bring the rocket safely back.","My freshman year of high school I joined the chess and math clubs.","Between rounds of speed chess I read enough of a programming manual to teach myself to write programs on the school's DEC mainframe in the language Basic.","Just before my final year of high school, my brother, sister and I moved with my mother to San Francisco.","My fellow students there were very smart, but the really novel thing was that they actually seemed to put a lot of effort into their school work. By the end of my first semester there, I began to get into that habit as well.","It was there I met my future wife, Celeste Landry, although our lives took us separate ways for many years and we were not to marry until more than ten years later.","The postdoc explained to me how to distinguish different sorts of particles on the basis of the amounts of energy they deposited in various sorts of detectors, spark chambers, calorimeters, what have you.","Six months after that, I left Taiwan, first for Hong Kong and then for mainland China, where I spent another three months studying still more Chinese and generally kicking around the country.","Travel provided many interesting experiences, but perhaps the most useful lesson I learned was that I really had no proficiency for learning the thousands of characters of the written Chinese language.","As it was, I realized choosing the study of Chinese literature as my life's work was probably a mistake.","Conversely, I came to realize that being good at something is hardly a reason to avoid doing it.","There are relatively few experiments in atomic physics these days that don't involve the use of a laser.","With every passing year, BEC proves that it still has surprises left for us."],"Eric Allman":["I like to eat good food.

Well, a negative decision from the Supreme Court will certainly make it appear so.","Certainly there are worse sins than doing everything possible to make your presidency matter.","Veteran print editors and reporters at places like the 'Times' and 'The New Yorker' manage to feed and clothe their families without costing their companies a million bucks a month, and they produce a great deal more valuable reporting and analysis than the network news stars do.","We live in a media world simultaneously obsessed with technology and personality.","Apple is a wonderful company for its customers and investors.

It's that they know what they are selling. Liberals in general and Obama in particular cannot say the same.","Much of what Tea Party candidates claimed about the world and the global economy during the 2010 elections would have earned their adherents a well-deserved F in any freshman economics (or earth science) class.","Liberals do not appear to address potential solutions with anything like the far right's aura of God-given self-confidence.","There are more people at Obama's table offering ideas than there were five years ago, but when it came to facing up to the Republicans' threat to force a double-dip recession if they didn't get their millionaires' tax cut, they still amounted to nothing. And therein lies our fundamental problem.","One of the many, many salutary aspects of Barack Obama's impending presidential nomination is the sea change his victory marks in the battle for the mind-set of the American foreign policy establishment.","Mistakes, after all, are endemic to foreign and military policy given the unpredictability of events and the difficulty of securing reliable information in a place like Iraq.","Recently released government economic statistics covering 2010, the first year of real recovery from the financial collapse of 2008, found that fully 93 percent of additional income gains coming out of the recession went straight into the wallets and purses of the top 1 percent.","America's great newspapers have staffs that range from 50 percent to 70 percent of what they were just a few years ago.","President Obama has lowered taxes more than he has raised them, and they are today lower than they were in President Reagan's time. But you don't hear conservatives crowing about that.","Ironically, tendency to ignore inconvenient facts and unwelcome evidence is actually President Reagan's true legacy, as I noted in 'The Nation' back in 2000, before the current right-wing mania for President Reagan gained its full force.","Face it, the system is rigged, and it's rigged against us.","Whether one agrees or disagrees with the tactics of the Occupy Wall Street movement, it's easy to understand the inspiration for its anger as well as its impatience.","Americans have always evinced some distrust of government, but the current situation has exacerbated this to a degree that may be unprecedented.","As with almost every significant aspect of the Bush presidency, its handling of 9/11 was a catastrophe from start to finish.","Liberals believe that they can't get a fair shake from the media anymore.","Local politics, like everything else, are not what they used to be. But the fact is that our political system - like our physical existence - still breaks down along geographical lines.","Whether people care enough about local news to pay for it is, sadly, an entirely different question than whether our democracy requires a strong watchdog function at the local level to ensure safeguards against abuse, chicanery, and outright dishonesty.","The Economist is undoubtedly the smartest weekly newsmagazine in the English language. I always look forward to its quirky year-end double issue.","American journalists tend to treat inequality as a fact of life. But it needn't be.","Fox News is nothing if not impressive. No matter how harsh the criticism it endures, the network somehow always manages to prove itself even worse than we had previously imagined.","This trend of reporting process over substance is unfortunate, if omnipresent. Even worse is the media's inability - or unwillingness - to fact-check Republicans who are angry about the Democrats trying to debate and vote on Iraq policy.","The myth of the liberal media empowers conservatives to control debate in the United States to the point where liberals cannot even hope for a fair shake anymore.","Warren Buffett pays taxes on a smaller percentage of his billions in income than his cleaning lady.","The consequences of President Johnson's campaign of deliberate deception regarding Vietnam could hardly have been more catastrophic for the nation, the military, the president, his party, and the presidency itself.","Three centuries after the appearance of Franklin's 'Courant', it no longer requires a dystopic imagination to wonder who will have the dubious distinction of publishing America's last genuine newspaper. Few believe that newspapers in their current printed form will survive.","Newspaper companies are losing advertisers, readers, market value, and, in some cases, their sense of mission at a pace that would have been barely imaginable just four years ago.","Trends in circulation and advertising - the rise of the Internet, which has made the daily newspaper look slow and unresponsive; the advent of Craigslist, which is wiping out classified advertising-have created a palpable sense of doom.","To own the dominant, or only, newspaper in a mid-sized American city was, for many decades, a kind of license to print money. In the Internet age, however, no one has figured out how to rescue the newspaper in the United States or abroad.","But particularly when the media profess to strive toward objectivity, gatekeepers play a crucial role in helping people navigate the news to make educated political decisions.","If bloggers are to improve our public discourse - helping busy and usually uninformed people make sense of the world - it is necessary to use some sort of standard with which to judge their reliability. Perhaps the answer (strictly advisory) is a body of their peers. Perhaps not.","Few progressives would take issue with the argument that, significant accomplishments notwithstanding, the Obama presidency has been a big disappointment.","Stylistically speaking, Barack Obama could hardly be further from Jimmy Carter if he really had been born in Kenya.","While history never repeats itself, political patterns do.","More and more, Democrats are starting to worry they that they have a more um, colorful version of Jimmy Carter on their hands. Obama acts cool as a proverbial cucumber but that awful '70s show seems frightfully close to a rerun.","Obama, like Carter, is reacting to warning signs by seeking to split the difference between dispirited Democrats and increasingly radicalized Republicans.","Philosophers and theologians have argued for centuries over the morality of targeted assassinations - a technique that the Israelis use with some frequency - without ever reaching anything approaching consensus.","Most of the provisions designed to fix what ails our health system don't kick in until 2014, which, one wishes administration officials had noticed, is two years after he has to win an election."],"Eric Andre":["I was eating beans by candle light for a decade.","I used to be a Geico Caveman for live events. I was a corporate mascot. It was the silliest job. It was actually awesome and fun, but it was retarded.","I don't think I would do a straight late-night talk show, like a 'Tonight Show' kind of thing. But I'm open to whatever is done well. I don't have any agenda. I'm not like Fugazi - I'm not trying to be just so punk rock until I die. Whatever is funny is good.","I think journaling is a key to success. You can set clear goals for yourself. You can start noticing repetitive behavior patterns and see the type of things that keep bothering you, and then you can have a bird's eye view of it.","People forget at the time that 'The Simpsons' started out, it was controversial - the fact that they said 'hell' and 'damn' in a cartoon was a lot. America was in an uproar.","I grew up in Boca Raton, Florida - the worst place on earth.","I have a karaoke punk band called The Ungrateful Dead, but we don't exist yet.","I was a class clown since second grade.","First paying gig, I got 20 bucks. I played at some really weird venue. I don't remember the venue; I just remember it was the last stop on the A train. It was, like, the Far Rockaways, Queens, and it was an audience of, like, three people.","I like Velvet Underground, but I was never really hardcore into them. I like them, and I like Nico, but I won't front like I'm super knowledgeable. I just never got around to it.","I want to be remembered for my poop jokes. Those are the most important kind.","I don't really know how music and comedy are similar. I try never to dissect it theoretically or academically.","I've never seen 'The Goonies.' I've never seen 'Indiana Jones.' I watched 'UHF' over and over again when I was little, and that was it. I had no time for any other movies. I watched 'Naked Gun,' 'UHF,' and 'Airplane!' over and over.","ABC is owned by Disney, so it's a little more conservative than Adult Swim. Polar opposites.","It's funny - almost every comedian that I started out with moved to L.A., except for my two friends Hannibal Buress and Amy Schumer. And my two friends that are doing the best in comedy, the most successful friends I have, are Hannibal Buress and Amy Schumer.","I loved 'Space Ghost' when I was in college.","From 'Chappelle's Show' to 'Tosh.0,' there's so much race comedy. It's overdone.","Hannibal Burress is my polar opposite in energy. I can be crazy, and he grounds the 'Eric Andre Show.'","You know something is a hit comedically if you can just call up one of your friends and belt out a line from the show and you both start laughing.","'The Simpsons' is like Charlie Parker or Marlon Brando or Richard Pryor: Comedy couldn't go back to the way it was after 'The Simpsons' came out.","'Wonder Showzen' is one of my favorite shows of all time. When I first saw it, I thought it was so funny and new and original and edgy and insane and subversive. I didn't know comedy could do that. It redefined what I thought you could do with a TV show.","Half the shows on Comedy Central are just multi-cam blue sets, and they kind of look like game shows from the '90s. It's like, 'Why do such a bland corporate aesthetic when the sky's the limit with what you can do?'","When you ask people who their favorite comedian is or favorite African-American comedian, people generally say Chris Rock, Dave Chappelle, Eddie Murphy, or Richard Pryor. Redd Foxx gets left out a lot.","I've always been obsessed with bad, awkward television and bad public access. Before YouTube, it was a treat coming across that stuff. When I moved to New York, I used to love watching public access late at night.","Dan Curry is the funniest guy in the world. I can sit in a room with him for hours, and he's just cracking me up constantly. And Kitao is the next Terry Gilliam. A lot of comedy directors are just comedic writers, but they don't have any sense of aesthetic or visual vocabulary."],"Eric Avery":["But the great thing, and the horrible thing about the web is you can just throw stuff up there and it doesn't cost anybody anything.","I know in my soul when something feels like a sell out and I think for me, I knew that if I did the Jane's Addiction reunion thing, that I would feel like a sell out. That's how it would feel to me.","I feel that Jane's is really a vibe and a time. It wasn't like we were the Beatles. We didn't have crafty pop songs where it sort of didn't matter who played them because they're just really great songs.","I've sort of had an investigatory relationship with being a musician. I really wasn't sure what I wanted to do. I felt I had had my run - I had done Jane's and I wasn't particularly interested in music anymore.","I said to myself a long time ago that I didn't want to be that hanging-on-for-too-long, aging-rock-musician guy, and that's why I sort of got away from music.","I started getting into Internet technologies and computers. I wasn't especially interested in being a musician, but I wound up finding my way back to being interested in music through computers.","That's it. With equal parts regret and relief, the Jane's Addiction experiment is at an end.","I just didn't like the idea of doing reunions, period. I could only see it as I'd just be going over the same old ground. I'm only years older and fatter and I'll just do an older, fatter version of me.","I have always considered reunions to be a way to make a quick buck, and it sells short my own experience of it the first time around."],"Eric Balfour":["By nature, I'm very care-taking. There's something really beautiful about cooking for someone and feeding them.","'Skyline' is an alien invasion film that really takes an interesting look at the genre. The writers did an amazing job of creating a new take at how life from other planets come and plan to invade Earth.","Every little opportunity and chance that I get to be on a set, to be a director, to utilize the skill sets that I already have and to learn what I don't know, and to see how I can improve upon that is just a really great opportunity for me.","As you get older and you hopefully battle your own demons, you find other reasons why you want to be an actor. The people that I truly admire do this because they love telling stories and they love the make-believe of the moment and not so much the gratification afterwards.","The stories that I like to tell and the movies I like are always grounded in the emotional arc of the characters.","To whatever degree you have as a celebrity or notoriety, there are people who see you as an opinion leader.","My family is Native American, and I was raised with Native American ceremonies.","The amazing thing about technology is that people have power. We are seeing it all the time in that innocuous people you would never know are having their voices heard because of this ability and technology we have.","I think 'Game Of Thrones' has been genius, and I really don't want it to end. Every episode is huge. It's totally immense, and the actors are all fantastic in it. It has totally drawn me in.","I'm not a trained chef, so I end up making stuff up. It either turns out brilliant or an absolute disaster. I just go for it.","I'm such an L.A. boy, I love hanging out by the beach and throwing some steaks on the grill."],"Eric Bana":["I look my best when I take my helmet off after a long motorcycle ride. I have a glow and a bit of helmet hair.","My chosen exercise is cycling. I just love it.","Technically speaking, you can build anything out of sand; it doesn't mean you do it.","Stand-up came out of three things. Frustration, necessity and arrogance. I didn't have a great career ahead of me in anything. Someone literally said to me, 'You should try stand-up,' and took me to a venue.","I wanted to be a mechanic. When I was 14 I wanted to quit school and go work on my car. But my dad said Son, you shouldn't do that. You should stay in school until your education is finished, and when you're done, don't make your hobby your job.","I've never been someone that's had a five-year plan, or a three-year plan. That just seems to lead to a lot of disappointment, and doesn't give you the chance to be flexible.","I didn't study Greek mythology in school and I wish I had.","I'm very much a bit of a ghost presence.","I think the beauty of working with young people is they remind you of the spirit of acting and it's just a big play.","I think love can come fairly easily and grow - but really liking the core essence of someone is a much harder thing to bottle. If you have both, you're in pretty good shape.","Each time you go to the same track you know whether you're improving or whether you're not... it's not open to interpretation. It's measurable - unlike acting.","I used to lift very heavy weights in my mid-twenties - I used to bench press over 300lb. The most I ever lifted was 330lb; I couldn't do that today, no way.","I've given no thought to moving to America at all.","I deliberately fly in and out of LA for as small a time as humanly possible.","I race historic muscle cars back in Australia, and that's my hobby. And I try to race home as soon as I've finished a movie but don't tell anyone.","I'd say I'm the opposite of someone that has the urge to stand in front of strangers and make them laugh, but the idea of getting up and telling a story and people finding it amusing always appealed to me.","The most serious film can be the most fun. The one that's supposed to be fun can be the most serious.","I think there are times when you walk onto a set you can potentially be either intimidated or distracted by what's going on around you.","I never look at the size of the film when I'm looking for a part.","When I go on the plane to fly home, I'm literally capable of forgetting what I do for a job. That also comes about because I choose to take massive breaks between projects, and because I choose to do this ridiculous thing of keeping home, home.","It's always bitterly disappointing to people to see how normally one can live.","You'll read things and say, this is a really good project and it's probably going to be a hit, but I can see 20 other people playing that part. You have to have some sense of ownership to do a good job and be married to it for ever.","I've always described parts as tattoos. For actors our tattoos are in the form of films.","I get inhabited by a character and then you mourn it. There's a period of mourning for me, definitely.","It's always been my hope, as an actor, to reveal only what is relevant about myself to the work.","There wasn't a moment where I got into cars. It wasn't a conscience decision or something that came later, it was there since I was born. I just love it.","A girl's got to be fun. It's the one bit of advice I always give to friends of mine who are thinking of getting married.","My wife and I really, really like each other as well as love each other.","I'm not into bikinis or other revealing clothing.","I'll give you a list of a hundred ways that I'm more likely to be injured than belting around a race track with people who know what they're doing. It's not a place where I feel I'm in unnecessary danger.","I've always been attracted to cars, and driving is a completely measurable experience: if you qualify last on the grid, you're the slowest, and if you qualify first on the grid, you're the fastest. So no one can say you're slow if you're fast and no one can say you're fast if you're slow.","When I was a kid, I would do stupid things on my bike. I'd jump any ramp, I'd jump over people, I'd jump over things - always crashing, never hurting myself badly but always wanting to take physical risks.","I'm always one time zone behind myself.","When you're shooting a film, you really don't get to be a dad, and you don't really get to be a husband. You don't really exist at all. But I do drag my family with me on location whenever I can.","I like the unknown. I like mystery.","I've always been a bit of a car freak.","I guess subconsciously that all the great people you work with have an influence on you.","I've worked with some of the great cinematographers. So I'm always watching what they do and I'm watching how the director composes his shots, just because I find it interesting as an actor; you're trying to help them out as well.","I really enjoy working on small films.","The longer you have something, the stronger the bond. That's true with people as well as things.","My background was producing and writing and performing in television when I started out, and I really missed that, that whole creative process that comes from sort of 'me' storytelling.","By the time I finished comedy, I was really burnt out of it. I had had enough. I don't really have a strong desire to prove myself in that area, or to go back to it in any great way.","As an actor I've been attracted to the sort of films that I want to go and see. That tends to usually be drama-related.","The reason my kids come to the set is so I can actually see them.","I have a theory that I really want my kids to know - the only coloration that they make between dad being in films and reality is just a lot of people doing a lot of hard work.","I fell in love with many women at school who had no idea I existed. I'm a bit of a romantic.","I think I wasted a lot of my youth, falling for girls who were a couple of years older than me.","I'm a bit of a romantic.","If you can jump up onstage and make people laugh, shouldn't you also be able to inhabit a character?","Over my lifetime, the car had actually transcended the fact that it is a car. It has become a venue.","I don't like to come at my character from some really technical place.","I always find that 90% of the performance, for me, is about what comes from inside.","If you're lucky enough to be involved in a film that's about something very real and that you hope will continue to hold up in 20 years' time it just gives you more energy and makes it feel all the more worthwhile.","I would never say never to returning to comedy.","I guess I'm a very keen observer, and I'd like to think I have a good imagination.","I'm always reading and looking around for the next thing.","I'm spending all my time and energy on the project at hand.","The darker the film, the more vital everyone's sense of humor is on set.","I am attracted to characters who think they are in control, but their situation is uncontrollable.","The movies people don't talk about or remember after six months' time don't really matter.","I wasn't going to be a college kid. The only subject I was interested in was English. I think I had a subconscious interest in analyzing story.","The more I love the character, the harder it is to get it wrong. I have to get to a point that I can speak for them.","I think luck gets you on to the stage. But it has nothing to do with keeping you there.","When I shoot I'll take my family with me - one movie a year and then the rest of the time at home.","I love being at home, being with friends and family. I'm of European stock, brought up in Australia. I'm a passionate guy. I just love life.","I hate being clean-shaven. My daughter gets very upset if I shave and says, 'Bring back the spikes, Dad.'","The Israeli accent wasn't one that I was overly familiar with so had to learn from scratch but I was very fortunate I had the right amount of time.","The only thing that may make me different from other people is I have passionate interests outside of work.","I occasionally go to the gym and I lift free weights, I don't use machines."],"Eric Bentley":["Geography is about maps, but biography is about chaps.","If one truly has lost hope, one would not be on hand to say so.","Ours is the age of substitutes: instead of language, we have jargon: instead of principles, slogans: and, instead of genuine ideas, bright ideas."],"Eric Berne":["The moment a little boy is concerned with which is a jay and which is a sparrow, he can no longer see the birds or hear them sing.","Games are a compromise between intimacy and keeping intimacy away.","A loser doesn't know what he'll do if he loses, but talks about what he'll do if he wins, and a winner doesn't talk about what he'll do if he wins, but knows what he'll do if he loses."],"Eric Berry":["I want to see how far I can go and how good I can be, whether it's in the classroom or on the football field.","I take pride in a lot of things people take for granted, so when opportunities come my way, I just cherish them and try to make the most of them.","Everything is a blessing, even meetings. Whether it's meetings or running gassers or lifting, it's an opportunity, and the best thing to do is be thankful for it.","It's never about the chemo; it's never about the cancer. It's all about what you're willing to put in to overcome whatever the obstacle is.","Fear nothing; attack everything.","The instincts and reaction and having to move - that's what football is. You have to learn how to deal with different adjustments, and know how to react to different types of plays. And do it on the fly.","I want to end my career in Kansas City. I want to play there. I love the city, I love the vibe; I love my teammates.","If you want to really learn your playbook, you just do it.","When you fight something like cancer, you not dealing with a person that looks at where you come from or what's your background or what race you are or what ethnicity or whatever. Whatever your culture is, it doesn't care about that. It doesn't sleep - it doesn't get tired - so if you make it about yourself, you're going to fail every time.","Going through chemo is a monster. You literally feel like you're dying every day.","Really, when you look at it, you're not battling the chemo, you're battling yourself the whole time. It was me versus me. There were many times where I didn't know if I would wake up tomorrow. I would just be up, scared to go to sleep.","I'm about business. I'm going to handle business like a professional. Aside from that, I'm going to give you everything I've got on every snap.","I've always got the itch to play. I don't like sitting out too long.","Just growing up, my dad always told me the most important point of the game is the extra point. A lot of people take that play off. It's an opportunity to make something happen, and I'm going to make the most of it."],"Eric Betzig":["It always irritated me that people think they have to be locked into a career path.","In my opinion, the only real asset one has is one's reputation, right? I mean, any company and institution can go belly up at any time. But if you have a good reputation, you know, you can usually find somebody who can - who thinks they can use what you have to offer.","Like you can't have a car that can take the kids to schools on Friday and win the grand prix on Saturday, you can't make a microscope that can do it all.","I don't like saying 'no' to people, and I'm going to have to learn how to say 'no' more.","Frankly, I guess, I don't really understand why people, why so many people, are so risk averse. You know, there's always ways to wiggle your way out of any situation if you're motivated enough.","Chemistry was always my weakest subject in high school and college.","The eventual goal is to marry all of my work together to make a high-speed, high-resolution, low-impact tool that can look deep inside biological systems.","Honestly, I feel you are poisoned if you read too much of the scientific literature because it makes you start thinking like other people. You're better off having a vague sense of what's going on and making your own way.","When I listen to music from different eras, I sense different things. The 1940s music, there's so much optimism and romance, maybe because they just solved the biggest problem on Earth at that time - World War II. In the 1960s, there was so much creativity and innovation in sound.","Sometimes I make an analogy that each scientific paper is like putting out another record. And some people have careers that are nothing but a one-hit wonder. And then there are people who are only appreciated by aficionados but largely forgotten by the wider community.","I was born in 1960 and can still tell you the name of every astronaut from Mercury to Apollo. If I had a chance, I'd love to go into space on one of the privately developed space crafts.","Science goes through fads, and there are big ups and crashes.","I missed the basic curiosity of being in the lab.","There's always something that an engineer can do to make microscopes better.","It's nice to be able to look at one protein, but life is driven by the interactions between proteins, so it's really essential to be able to see multiple proteins at a time to understand these interactions.","One thing I liked about being in microscopy is it gets you out of your box constantly because there's such a diverse range of applications.","In essence, we're imaging the same cell for anywhere from forty to a hundred thousand times to create one of the movies that we see.","You get so tied up with the minutiae of the day-to-day, there's never a chance to sit back and let your subconscious run wild.","I really didn't like the academic structure of science, but I realized I loved science and missed science.","We can track and see the production of single molecules, trace them and see how they assemble into structures.","You need a continuous picture of how things are evolving, and not a slow series of snapshots where you don't know how frame A is related to frame B.","Every new invention is like a baby. You think it may cure cancer or become the president, but in the end, you're happy it just stays out of jail.","There are many cells you could look at forever in 3D.","It takes a huge amount of effort to move from a successful high-tech prototype to broader adoption of an imaging technology.","I'm spoiled. All of my adult jobs have left me with complete freedom to come up with what I wanted.","I hate driving a bandwagon.","The question was, 'Is there a way of minimizing the amount of damage you're doing so that you can then study cells in a physiological manner while also studying them at high spatial and temporal resolution for a long time?'","What was shocking to us was that by spreading the energy out across seven beams instead of one, the phototoxicity went way down."],"Eric Bogosian":["As soon as the dirt is hitting the casket, it'll all be forgotten.","The world intrudes in my brain daily. Since my brain is dripping with all kinds of stuff that's out there in the world, that I can't seem to be able to shut out, it has to end up being in my work as well.","I write my plays to create an excuse for full-tilt acting and performing.","For a long time, my shows were about people walking out or about getting my gigs canceled or having the presenter not wanting to pay me.","I do write about people who are complex and are striving with something and can't quite get past their own stuff, which would be a proxy for myself because that's what the deal is with me.","I don't know anybody who does what I do. I'm very underground.","I love playing other people's work. I love acting.","I was definitely surprised when Talk Radio took off as a play. As a film it has become somewhere between a popular thing and a cult thing.","I'm always surprised by things that happen to my work.","I'm not a light-hearted person, so I can't think light-hearted at work.","I'm not hip, I'm not cool, I'm not glib.","If we all knew we were going to live to be 150 years old, we'd all approach our lives very differently.","If you say city to people, people have no problem thinking of the city as rife with problematic, screwed-up people, but if you say suburbs - and I'm not the first person to say this, it's been said over and over again in literature - there's a sense of normalcy.","It's a mental fake-out to myself. I make believe I'm making a new show so I forget the material I was working on and make up some fresh material.","Well, the real Eric Bogosian is pretty self-conscious of himself.","Ensemble is hard to do. It's like 3-D chess.","I know that I'm inadequate, but I never thought that at seventeen. I thought I was doing the best I could. I thought I was being idealistic.","I provide the bricks and mortar with the words and situations - the director and the actors and the designers build the house.","I started acting when I was in high school, started writing when I got to New York in 1975.","I write for an audience that likes what I like, reads what I read, thinks about the things I think about. In many ways, this puts me in opposition to the people who go to the theater generally.","I write, but I also act.","I'm very underground.","If all I ever wrote about was inner city freaks, I think it would be dishonest."],"Eric Braeden":["Raising children is an enormously important part of life. I think one of the most important, or the most important, period.","The challenge in daytime in particular, I think, is to go against all the traditional cliches of daytime and try to make it real.","If we keep on ignoring and leaving children to their own devices at home, they become latchkey kids, and trust me, the consequences of that are not good.","It's very difficult to judge relationships from the outside. You never know what happens in intimate moments with two people to know why they really support and love each other.","Being in love, and I'm not an expert in this, I've lived it as much as anyone has, but I've not dissected it.","If you're a young couple when you start out and are both working, trying to raise children, that is tough.","Not too many people can afford for the wife to stay home and raise the kids.","A mother's got to be there to raise the children. That's all there is to it. I feel badly for those mothers who work hard, and can't do it all the time.","If it's really so wonderful that both partners have to work to make a living to pay for their house, for health insurance, someone is obviously going to get the short end of the stick.","I'm not a politician.","The workplace should have a place where the kids can visit. They should have places at the mother's or the father's work where professionals can have their kids visit them whenever they feel like it.","If both parents must work, I think it is more important that the mother has proximity to the child to therefore establish a childcare situation at the big corporations not once a day, but many times a day.","My heart goes out to many women that I've met across the country who barely make enough to make a living, and they want to have kids. That's very understandable, but what do you do with the kids?","A relationship has to be cultivated. There have to be feelings of love for another first. But then you have to really like the person.","I have a feeling that being in love sometimes means the projection of your desires onto another person. The important thing is that you like the other person, respect the other person and want to raise children with the other person.","Some situations are so hopeless when you look at them from the outside you say, Why are they still married?","I'm not saying that people should not divorce, but at the rate at which it happens here is sick. The kids, they suffer. I don't care what anyone says.","To establish personal relationships with the people you work with is stupid, because you never know when the winds will change. I try not to get too close to people.","Writing for a soap - writing for 25 characters day in, day out - is one of the most difficult jobs in Hollywood.","In the end, I'm an actor. I'm paid for what I bring to the screen.","When I think about my great conversations with Marlon Brando on the set of 'Morituri,' I think there's a story there, just as I do with my experience working with James Cameron on 'Titanic.' And then there are all my years on 'Y&R' and all that has happened there.","How many reality shows can you watch? They're so obviously phony.","There are some directors I hear about in nighttime or some I used to work with who walk around like gods.","The directors I respect are the ones who have a collaborative attitude, who collaborate with actors.","There's no one more willing to do something than an actor when it comes to perfecting a scene.","The great thing about America, what I've loved about it, is how sports-friendly it is. In America, sports are respected and loved.","America has the best athletic programs. Even when the Soviet Union existed, that was Mickey Mouse compared to the U.S.","That's the biggest shame there is, that L.A. doesn't have a team. I was a big fan of the L.A. Rams, and when they left, I lost interest. Then there was the Raiders, and they left. How they can't have a football team in the biggest market in the world is beyond me.","To support my brothers and me, my mother got a job so menial that we never discussed it.","I think 'Y&R's future is contingent upon the ratings. Obviously, none of the soaps are kept alive for the sake of loyalty. It's all about ratings. It's show business. Period."],"Eric Bristow":["I have two bowls of confidence for breakfast each morning.","I like a drink, mate. I'll have maybe 10 or 12 pints on a good night out.","My dad was an Arsenal supporter and he used to take me there, but I've always been Chelsea.","I knew I didn't want to be stuck in Stoke Newington for the rest of my life, hanging about with idiots. That wasn't for me. I wanted to go out and have a look around.","You can't drink too many otherwise you can't see what you're throwing at.","I'm not on Twitter or Facebook and don't even use email. I don't trust computers: one day they'll all break down, and everyone will be knackered.","Hopefully I've given something back to darts, which has been brilliant to me. Hopefully I made it a bit popular when I first started; I was part of the breakaway, and I also created a monster, so I think I've done a little bit.","I love cheese and biscuits, the stronger the better.","I've got a nice little crafty deal with the people in Barbados; 10 days out there teaching the locals how to play darts for an hour a day. Get paid for that as well.","By the time I was 25 or 26, I would have earned a million, but if you looked in the bank account, it's not there because I've spent it. That's what it's there for. I don't want to be the richest bloke in the graveyard. Look at Elvis.","All this cuddling and kissing on stage these days, well it's all right in football when someone scores a goal, but not when you're playing darts.","I don't read books.","You eat when you're hungry, and I'm not normally hungry in the mornings.","Mark my words, Michael Van Gerwen will knock Phil Taylor off his perch one day and be the best darts player on the planet.","Ever since I've been 16, 15, that's all I've been doing: playing darts.","It's all right buying all these good players but they've got to gel, and that takes time.","I remember when we were in the World Cup in Australia and I had to win the singles against Tony Payne, best of seven legs, to win it. I was 2-0 down but ended up beating him 4-2.","The Crafty Cockney had a picture of the owner dressed up as a copper, so I brought it home, wore it on TV and the name just stuck.","It took me about 10 years to get rid of. I'm all right now, though, lovely, I'm throwing some nice darts at the moment, but every now and then I get a bit of a jump. I wish I could find a cure, I'd make a bloody fortune.","I play a lot of charity golf mainly. I'm a bandit 18 if I play two or three times a week.","Trouble is, I don't get to play a lot at the moment because I've just signed a contract where I've got to do 200 shows a year in pubs, so the golf's fallen away a bit.","Nah, I don't watch TV either, apart from a few sports programmes. I just don't have the time.","When Phil Taylor is in the field - no matter whether it's tiddlywinks or the world championship at Alexandra Palace - he is the man to beat.","Any sport where people earn a lot of money you are going to get groupies.","I was born at the right time. I was a freak - the only young player when darts took off in the 1970s.","My dad bought me a dartboard for my 11th birthday, and I became intrigued by the game.","I was 15 when I got my first job as a proofreader for an advertising agency in the City, earning £12 a week. But by then, I was already playing darts tournaments every weekend, regularly winning the £50 first prize. By the time I was 16 and winning two or three contests a weekend, I ditched the agency job and concentrated on darts.","When it comes to spending, I don't splash out on fancy cars - I never have. I'm not a car man and, in fact, don't even drive. Although I own a vehicle - it only cost £3,000, and I can't even tell you the make - friends are kind enough to drive me around. It doesn't make sense to waste lots of money on cars.","In 1987 I got dartitis, a psychological condition which means you can't let your darts go properly. For a time, I wondered what the hell I was going to do if I didn't recover. But I remained positive and, thankfully, got over it. It occurred during the Swedish Open when I found I couldn't let the darts go."],"Eric Brown":["I think it's a short story writer's duty, as well as writing well about emotions and characters, to write story.","Well, to be honest I think I'm a better short story writer than a novelist. Novels I find very hard, hours and hours, weeks and weeks, of conscious thought - whereas short stories slip out painlessly in a few days.","Why my interest in writers? Well, I'm one, and many of my friends are writers. I know what it's like to write. I'm interested in the creative process. I'm fascinated by the disparity between who we are on the outside, and what we have bubbling away inside us.","I think my fascination is less with genre figures than with writers in general.","The inspiration to write? Perhaps it's not so much inspiration, as a NEED to write. I get itchy and guilty and dissatisfied when I haven't written for a while. Ideas come to me and need to be written down.","I write about five thousand words a day, when working on a book, about three thousand a day if I'm writing a short story. I take long periods off between projects, when I read a lot, garden, and think about the next book or stories.","Which, of course, isn't the point of writing - but it would be nice if, along with the creative satisfaction of writing and seeing my work in print, I could do more than merely scrape a living. Okay, moaning over.","'Made it as a writer'? I'm still wondering if I've made it as a writer. I've made it as a published writer of the type of SF that I want to write and read, but I'm still waiting for that big breakthrough.","The market for short stories is hard to break into, but a magazine editor isn't always looking for big names with which to sell his magazine - they're more willing to try stories by newcomers, if those tales are good.","The professionals are going to be joined by the average Joe. Everybody's a publisher.","To me, it's all about opening all the doors and getting people to be not only prolific, but creative and having control of their music.","You don't have to fight for your life anymore. You're starting a new one."],"Eric Burdon":["On Memorial Day, I don't want to only remember the combatants. There were also those who came out of the trenches as writers and poets, who started preaching peace, men and women who have made this world a kinder place to live.","Inside each of us, there is the seed of both good and evil. It's a constant struggle as to which one will win. And one cannot exist without the other.","Everything changes and, somewhere along the line, I'm changing with it.","Britain, and my hometown, will always be with me wherever I go and whatever I do - but I prefer to live in California.","Having lived in the arid deserts of Southern California since the 1970s, my interest in water conservation is a very personal concern. Water! The source of life! Some people are squandering the world's most precious resource while others have too little clean water to drink.","I'm really still a child of the Forties. I still think about it a lot, about the repercussions of armed conflict. Until 1953 we had rationing. We couldn't buy meat, we couldn't buy pleasurable goods like cigarettes and sweets. I didn't starve - my family were lucky - but I knew what it was like standing in line waiting for foodstuffs.","As far as the Animals breaking up - it was my fault. I wanted out. We took it to the max, as far as we could take it. Our reunion tour in 1983 went pretty good until we left America. Then we pushed it too hard and it fell apart.","Longevity is something I never gave a second thought to. I guess it's the shadow of growing up in post WWII, but I never believed I would live past 20. Here I am though... a senior citizen... my voice and heart are stronger than ever, but boredom is the greatest enemy so I have to be careful not to slip over the edge.","The rock biz is the low end of the creative world. Faces come and go so fast.","There are so many times in one's life, when one feels he has nothing more to offer. But no, my river has not run dry.","It's the need for change that drives us to join forces with our brothers and sisters all around the world - but change is slow.","My voice? Yeah, well, I used to drink a lot of beer when I was a kid and I sounded like a drunk in a choir. I don't drink anymore.","From my personal point of view, the Animals are dead. They killed themselves.","I did have a life before the Animals, and I'm trying constantly to prove that I have a life after the Animals. People tend to forget that I was the frontman with War for two years. People sort of have compartmental memories.","I always wanted to be a Californian. In my wildest dreams, I always liked California - it's the place where oranges grows on trees! Fruit just falls off the trees.","I was in college, and very disappointed. I majored in commercial art and interior design for three or four years. At that time, it seemed the thing I really wanted to do, production design, just wasn't available in the U.K., so I turned to music.","I live my life, breathless... A life of constant motion and excitement. A life that many will envy and most would avoid!","The Animals were their own worst enemy. The Animals were a band that couldn't live up to their name. I was the singer in the band and as long as I was enjoying myself I would keep on working with the band. But it got to be rather nasty once the big money showed up - things started to turn toxic.","I don't think Jimi committed suicide in the conventional way. He just decided to exit when he wanted to.","You know, jazz is the mother of all American music. R&B and pop and rap and everything are the branches on the main tree of the life of music, American music, which is jazz.","The basis of everything that I plugged into when I was younger was blues, and it always stayed with me.","Everything I do - if I do it, is going to be personal.","Recording - once something's done, it's done, there's not much you can do about it. It's out there and you just have to pray to the gods.","OK, I've had a life of sort of success, some people know who I am but a lot of people don't. I feel the need to change that still.","I have a life beyond performance. I love it, and it probably is the better part of my life, but I do have another life.","I feel great that I've been given a chance in the golden years of my life. To me, it's the last battle, and I've been given a chance to get stuck in some good armament, some good power, and there's a chance that now I can finish off my working years with my head held high.","I may sing the same songs for over 40 years now but I always sing them in different ways in order to keep the excitement and passion alive.","It's more important what you leave to people on this planet. I want my legacy to exist now, currently, not after I'm gone.","Blues was made for the recessed.","One of my reasons for living in California is its close proximity to Mexico. The Latin influence is in every corner of the community. My love of Spanish music hasn't wavered since the '50s. I could hear the blues voicing from the Flamanco families and I always dig for inspiration in Latin music.","Have you seen 'American Idol' lately? I'm sure that some kids somewhere at this moment are thrashing themselves silly over what they call 'Rock n' Roll.'","I look upon The Animals, they were a great band initially, we left our mark, but thing was it was a band that couldn't live up to its name so I soldiered on. On one level, it was devastating for a while. On another level, maybe I should thank them for helping me make my own way in my own career.","There are some songs that don't belong to The Animals that I refuse to give in to and not do. I enjoy singing other people's songs, you know. That's why they're written in the first place.","You have to be very careful how you insert new stuff, 'cause people want to hear the old stuff. It's like cooking, you know? You can't put too many peppers into the eggs... otherwise it's going to be distasteful.","I used to hang out a lot in jazz clubs, and the groups took to a kid like me who wasn't afraid to get up and sing with a jazz band. Then I started to hang out in rock clubs and learned to carry off different styles.","People we've encountered at pivotal moments who profoundly influence our direction are not necessarily the people whose names everybody knows. More often, they are the people who say or do just the right thing, at the right time.","In the day-to-day life of a traveling musician, it's easy to miss so many details. The world goes by at high-speed; it will take your breath away."],"Eric Butterworth":["Prosperity is a way of living and thinking, and not just money or things. Poverty is a way of living and thinking, and not just a lack of money or things.","Our job is not to set things right but to see them right.","Don't go through life, grow through life.","Evil, and evil spirits, devils and devil possession, are the outgrowth of man's inadequate consciousness of God. We must avoid thinking of evil as a thing in itself - a force that works against man or, against God, if you will.","God can only do for you what He can do through you.","One of the best things to do sometimes is simply to be.","We don't change what we are, we change what we think what we are.","Fundamentalists believe Jesus was God becoming man. I believe that Jesus was man becoming God.","I am not what I think. I am thinking what I think.","The one thing that a fish can never find is water; and the one thing that man can never find is God.","Where you are in consciousness has everything to do with what you see in experience.","While many people are trying to be in tune with infinite, what they really are is in tune with the indefinite.","Your fortune is not something to find but to unfold."],"Eric C. Anderson":["The private sector is motivated by profit and efficiency and the US government often is not.","For the first time in history, a private company is organizing a mission to the moon. This mission will inspire countries of the world, citizens, our youth."],"Eric Cantona":["I am searching for abstract ways of expressing reality, abstract forms that will enlighten my own mystery.","If someone is too perfect they won't look good. Imperfection is important.","On sand, you can never be sure of anything. An ordinary shot can take a wicked deflection at the last moment.","Children go where they find sincerity and authenticity.","Manchester United is stronger than anybody in the world.","Sometimes you surprise the goalkeeper and sometimes the goalkeeper surprises you. In my career, I tried to do more of the first than the second.","I think life is a big game we play.","When the seagulls follow the trawler, it's because they think sardines will be thrown into the sea.","I have great memories.","My ancestors were fighters, something I have inherited.","In England, your life is your life.","When the seagulls follow the trawler, it is because they think sardines will be thrown into the sea.","We knew that you don't get to be world champions without a struggle.","For me, I don't like it when there is too much interference in our lives. We're not children. It is our own life in our hands.","You retire, but you're still aching to play. But in order to play, you have to resist certain temptations, and train hard. And I just didn't have the desire to do that any more.","I think I have a sense of mischief and that I can laugh at myself.","Even as a footballer, I was always being creative.","My best moment? I have a lot of good moments but the one I prefer is when I kicked the hooligan.","Being French, to me, is first and foremost being a revolutionary.","I didn't want really to be involved in a normal soccer club.","I didn't study; I live.","I don't care about the past.","We all seem to be about aggression and greed. It's a massive pressure that affects us all.","Sometimes you get submerged by emotion. I think it's very important to express it - which doesn't necessarily mean hitting someone.","Football lost its excitement for me.","It's my country but I don't want to know about France - I was born there but I feel English.","The French have only negative things to say about everything and everyone.","What is the system? It revolves around the banks, the system is built on the power of the banks, so it can be destroyed through the banks.","Every experience makes you a man.","I think it's better to be involved in one or two movies a year.","Great businessmen are creators.","I always planned to retire when I was at the top and at Manchester United I have reached the pinnacle of my career.","My father's parents were from Sardinia and my mother's from Barcelona.","Actually, I wanted to act even when I was still playing football.","I don't want to be in Terminator. I don't want to go to Hollywood.","I manage a team, for beach soccer. I'm the coach. Player, coach.","I prefer to play and lose rather than win, because I know in advance I'm going to win.","I started beach football in Monte Carlo when I retired from football in 1997. I liked the game very much.","I stopped playing football because I'd done as much as I could. I needed something which was going to excite me as much as football had excited me.","I try to find different ways of expressing myself. Without that I will die.","I'm proud of what I achieved there, but a life built on memories is not much of a life.","If you have only one passion in life - football - and you pursue it to the exclusion of everything else, it becomes very dangerous. When you stop doing this activity it is as though you are dying. The death of that activity is a death in itself.","In football you have an adversary; in cinema that adversary is yourself.","It is enjoyable to make things visible which are invisible.","Often there are players who have only football as a way of expressing themselves and never develop other interests. And when they no longer play football, they no longer do anything; they no longer exist, or rather they have the sensation of no longer existing.","Sometimes in life one experiences an emotion which is so strong that it is difficult to think, or to reason.","The pressure people put on themselves and the rivalry between the teams is much more marked. And I think that's a good thing. As long as that rivalry remains within the spirit of competition, it con only spur everyone on.","We won the European Championship last September and now the world title. That is some year for French beach soccer! Now comes the hard part. We have to keep improving and that's difficult because it's tough to do better than winning a world title.","You can lose in cinema too if you don't put on a good performance.","Some people need to stay at the top. They are afraid to re-start from zero because they fear the critics.","I don't take life so seriously... I can just play with life.","I live to feel myself in danger.","You need a particular talent only to want to please. I don't have this talent.","When times are difficult, I tell myself, 'I'm just passing through.'","He who has regrets cannot look at himself in the mirror.","I know that I have a face, a look, people aren't used to seeing. A presence.","I don't need to be involved with a game watched by millions of people to be fulfilled.","I want to look forward.","I don't know where my medals are.","You can feel very quickly as a prisoner of your past, of the memories.","The revolution is really easy to do nowadays.","I don't think we can be entirely happy seeing such misery around us.","I like to stay at home and make cinema in my head.","I don't want to go to Hollywood.","We can be eaten by techniques and forget what we have inside of us.","I try to be honest.","When you arrive in England for football it's a paradise.","I apologize for nothing.","I always wanted to play against the best.","I like to be fascinated by the people I photograph. Sometimes I don't admire them but I'm interested in them.","I'm just enjoying my life at the moment.","I found leaving Manchester United very, very hard.","I always knew I had to work hard.","The real fans of football come from the working class. Now they cannot afford to come and watch the game.","I'm never bored.","We all have common frailties but we need to treasure friends more.","I see the world become so uniform. Everybody has to be the same. I like people who are different.","I have to wear clothes but I don't like to give an idea of what I am with clothes.","I have a car but it's not important.","Some films I say no to and they end up working very well, but I don't care, I just want to do something exciting.","I'm lucky to have the privilege of being able to choose what I want to do.","Being on stage isn't so tough compared to the football pitch.","I observe the world and the people surrounding me.","A home is crucial, the foundation of a stable family.","It is unacceptable that people often have to make huge sacrifices just to find a place to live, a roof over their heads.","Desire is important."],"Eric Cantor":["The issue for us is rebuilding a governing majority that is comfortable with differences that can transcend the divisiveness and unify behind the principles that we know our party has succeeded on.","What the president announced yesterday, is that somehow magically, if we just continue to prime the pump of taxpayer dollars, we're going to see magically an economic recovery.","It is time for us to insist that we are accountable for the money that we are spending.","I am hopeful for the American people that we can actually improve the outlook for bringing down costs in health care.","We've had Town Hall meetings, we've witnessed election after election, in which the American people have taken a position on the President's health care bill. And the bottom line is the people don't like this bill. They don't want it.","We have a plan that creates universal access programs at the state level which allows folks to access insurance if they're denied by their insurer.","I mean, look, Nancy Pelosi said in the very beginning this is going to be the most open, honest and ethical Congress in history. And what we're seeing is she's breaking that promise every day.","And basically, the sense of the 'Pledge to America' is this: Republicans understand when we were in charge, we got fired in '06. We spent too much money. We defied the trust that the people had put in us. And we know that there is a better way.","We as Republicans understand that we have got to protect these... entitlement programs - these entitlement programs for our seniors today. And we have to sit down and have a discussion. We need more ideas on the table.","People have to take responsibility for themselves. We need to get the housing industry going again. We don't need government intervening in every step.","Whether it's people walking off 'The View' when Bill O'Reilly makes a statement about radical Islam or Juan Williams being fired for expressing his opinion, over-reaching political correctness is chipping away at the fundamental American freedoms of speech and expression.","Look, we know we screwed up when we were in the majority. We fell in love with power. We spent way too much money - especially on earmarks. There was too much corruption when we ran this place. We were guilty. And that's why we lost.","We will cut programs, we will try to rein in the size of the bureaucracy. We will bring federal pay scales that have become so exaggerated into line with market rates.","We know that appropriators will fight these cutbacks. But by eliminating earmarks, we can stop the horse trading that grows agency budgets.","In a perfect world we would bring corporate tax rates down to 25% or less so we can get competitive in the world economy. Ultimately, I would love to see a flat tax.","Well, if Democratic members in the House elect Nancy Pelosi as their leader, it's almost as if they just didn't get the message from the voters this election. I mean, the voters outright rejected the agenda that she's been about. And here they're going to put her back in charge.","I am not for raising taxes in a recession, especially when it comes to job creators that we need so desperately to start creating jobs again.","I mean, the Obama position has been, 'We think government ought to be spending this money, not the people who earn it.'","You know, we have a fiscal train wreck before us. And unless we act, and act deliberately, we're not going to enable our kids to have what we have. It's plain and simple as that.","It's all about the fungibility and money. If Planned Parenthood accesses hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayer money and they use that for other purposes, then they can use other dollars to fund abortion.","You know, there are people making a lot of money in this country who can actually afford their own health care. We are in a situation where we got a safety net in place in this country for people who frankly don't need one. We got to focus on making sure we got a safety net for those who actually need it.","We believe that if you put in place the mechanisms that allow for personal choice as far as Medicare is concerned, as well as the programs in Medicaid, that we can actually get to a better result and do what most Americans are learning how to do, which is to do more with less.","The Republicans have put together serious detailed counter-proposals when we have objected to this administration's agenda. And so, I want to tell the President and remind him again, we're not voting no for political expediency. We've got our principles, and we're going to stand up and defend those.","But, as we've seen over the last several months, the people in this country are very dissatisfied with the direction that this administration is taking this country. And what we heard last night was absolutely the ignoring of that fact. It was: We're going to continue with this agenda. In fact, we're going to double down on healthcare.","Now the proposal is yet again another $150 billion before we start to think about a freeze. But $150 billion spent on more government programs; monies being created to direct and what kind of jobs that Washington thinks ought to be created. Come on. I mean there is a government that can help, and the government can also hurt.","We believe very strongly that you stop that denial of coverage by promoting choice. Let people make the decisions.","If the President says, oh, Washington's got to change, and people are doubting whether my change can really happen, I think instead what the public's begun to see is the change they're seeing is not the change they voted for.","The American people elected us here to cut spending so we can create an environment for jobs in America. The House has acted. We have demonstrated that we want to see spending, discretionary spending, brought down to levels of 2008. We've seen no counteraction. We have seen no position that has been expressed by the other side at all.","Again, the American people expect us to do what they are doing. It's tightening the belt, it's learning how to do more with less. That's a reality today, and we've got to do that in order to get the private sector growing.","What this bill says is it reiterates again the deadline, and that the Senate should act before the deadline, and that's what the American people are expecting.","The bill then says if the Senate does not act, then H.R. 1 (the House-passed bill that cuts $61 billion) will be the law of the land. In addition to that, it says that if all else fails, and the Senate brings about a shutdown, then members should not get their pay."],"Eric Carle":["We have eyes, and we're looking at stuff all the time, all day long. And I just think that whatever our eyes touch should be beautiful, tasteful, appealing, and important.","The hardest part is developing the idea, and that can take years.","One day I think it's the greatest idea ever that I'm working on. The next day I think it's the worst that I've ever worked on - and I swing between that a lot. Some days I'm very happy with what I'm doing, and the next day I am desperate - it's not working out!","Let's put it this way: if you are a novelist, I think you start out with a 20 word idea, and you work at it and you wind up with a 200,000 word novel. We, picture-book people, or at least I, start out with 200,000 words and I reduce it to 20.","That's something I learned in art school. I studied graphic design in Germany, and my professor emphasized the responsibility that designers and illustrators have towards the people they create things for.","They are deceptively simple. I admit that. But for me, all my life I try to simplify things. As a child in school, things were very hard for me to understand often, and I developed a knack, I think. I developed a process to simplify things so I would understand them.","You know, now it's sinking in. It's taken me a long time to realize - and it is sinking in - how important this book is. And I have a certain distance now. I've done it such a long time ago."],"Eric Carr":["I can't say why people lie; they just do. Everyone has their own reasons for not telling the truth.","You know, who cares about seeing the girls when everybody wants to see the band. That's what's important, KISS is important. I think we look great, and the attitude is there, and I'm real happy with it.","Yup, the toilet is my best friend before a show.","When I was a kid, I went through a lot of musical phases, and one was when I'd learn everything that The Beatles ever recorded. After I started drums, I fell in love with their music so much that I just wanted to learn everything.","I wished that I could have been down there because Paul actually wanted me to do the tour with him, but then he realized that it just wouldn't be right. It wouldn't be a solo tour anymore. It would look like just half of KISS.","I was in one bar band from 1965 to '69, then I was in another one from 1970 to '79 - a 9-year bar band!","There's no dancing girls. We're kinda like secondary to the thing. It's a story about these two guys that are in love with this one girl and how it unfolds and what happens.","I can't wait to get out. It's been much too long, I don't like being home. I'd rather play. This tour is going to be really big. We're gonna have the biggest show we can have. It's gonna be different not like the old KISS shows."],"Eric Christian Olsen":["I was doing auditions and meetings during the day and going to culinary school at night. And then 'NCIS' happened. So I dropped out of culinary school.","At culinary school, none of the things we use to define ourselves outside that world - actor, producer, student - none of that matters. It's a magical art form.","I'm 100% Norwegian. Three generations removed and all continuous inbreeding of Norwegian of Minnesota and Iowa, so I traveled to Norway before.","I played 15 years of hockey, and I got more injured doing two weeks of cheer camp.","I grew up in Iowa, and the improv comedy club Comedy-Sportz across the river in Illinois held auditions. They took me even though I was only 16 - you really had to be 18, but they never checked me for ID.","You pursue what you love, and if you find beauty or truth, you go with that.","I was at Pepperdine University in Malibu, and during my sophomore year, I played a dying burn victim on 'ER.' The makeup artist put burn makeup all over my body and I couldn't move or eat for 12 hours. I lost 8 pounds that week.","When I was in the gunner's bubble of a B25 bomber, taking off from an aircraft carrier 100 miles off the coast of San Diego, I remember saying to myself how amazing it was to get the chance to do that."],"Eric Church":["I am very thankful and blessed to have a healthy and happy baby boy and baby mama.","With bullying and all the stuff going on, words are very important. Words can be more hurtful than anything physically. I got little kids, and it's common sense when you're raising them that the main thing is how you talk to people, and how you treat people. Sometimes I think the world forgets that as we get older.","Life doesn't get more real than having a newborn at home.","I went to my dad when I was 17 and said, 'I want to be a country music star.' Which every dad loves to hear. And he said, 'I want you to go to college.' So we had a discussion. And I'm pretty stubborn. I'm a lot like him. And he said, 'If you go to college and graduate, I'll pay your first six months of rent in Nashville.' So he bribed me.","I have a new hobby and it's pretty much logging.","I would be on the 'anti-reality' show. I can't stand reality TV. I can tell you one that I absolutely would not be on, and that's 'Dancing With the Stars.' If you ever see me on that show, just please understand my family is starving to death, and things are really bad in the Church household.","I really love pizza after midnight.","I was in Iowa one time, and I kept trying to fire up the crowd, and I kept saying, 'How's Ohio doing?' For some reason, they just weren't coming around!","I want to be the guy out there on the edge.","There's a roots nature to Appalachia - the origins of folk and bluegrass. I know guys there who are some of the best players I've ever heard but are playing on their porch tonight because they've never chased success. There's simplicity to how they live and what they care about.","Looking back on my career, some of the hardest times - eight people at a show, 12 people on a bus - were some of the most fun.","Music is universal; it speaks to people's souls on the deepest level.","To me, the most powerful people in this country, politically, are mayors. If you took all the mayors of the 25 biggest cities and you got them together, you could do more on that level than you ever could through the bureaucracy in Washington.","Country music is the song that speaks to the American condition. It's middle America. Eight out of 10 people. Maybe it's not the No. 1 choice, but they listen to country.","The key to songwriting is just to be able to observe, and put yourself in situations to be around people, and let those ideas come to you.","My favorite thing is to go out in the arenas, like, an hour before doors, and run the concourse. And you get that anticipation. You smell the popcorn. You see the people tapping the kegs. And nobody is in there yet but you, but you feel it. It's my favorite thing on tour.","The town I came from really had one industry, and that was furniture.","I'm not a trust-fund type.","Everybody always tells you what an awesome and unique experience being a parent is. Words can never do the feeling justice.","I've always made music that was representative of real life.","If I wanted the ticket to be a $200 ticket, I'd have made it a $200 ticket, but I don't want it to be that.","Bob Seger was a huge inspiration.","I think right now, you've seen these artists pop up over the last decade who've flirted with branching together a lot of different kinds of music. Some of them have been huge, and sold millions of records. And I think over time it's become a little bit of what the industry can be.","The most important thing for me as an artist is having an identity.","I have a huge chip on my shoulder.","As far as writing, it's grown because I've really grown comfortable with who I am.","Once your career becomes about something other than the music, then that's what it is. I'll never make that mistake.","Many people have come to think they can just wake up and have things handed to them.","I've played shows with injuries before but unfortunately cannot overcome having no voice.","Music's cyclical. There's always that next generation that always comes along.","When I feel like every day when I get up I'm writing songs, that's the time to make a record.","I don't use the big video screens that a lot of other artists use because personally, I think it's kind of a crutch. I think sometimes it's like watching television as opposed to really getting involved with what is happening onstage and the people in your section.","I'm going to do everything I can to keep from being mainstream.","I can't stand making records.","I don't care if I starve.","The stigma with country is it's not cool. That's wrong. Country is very cool. I look at award shows, I look at how country is represented. Country is represented with an asterisk. We have to perform collaborations. We have to perform a tribute. We can't perform by ourselves.","I think we make too many records. One record a year is crazy to me. But some people have to sell tickets. The label has to meet their quarterly number: 'We need a record a year.' All of a sudden, the tail's wagging the dog. It's not the music; it's everything else making the music. That's just backwards. It's wrong.","I don't really get into that whole red-blue-conservative-liberal because I can't tell them apart. They all seem inept. So, for me, it's not something I focus on at all. I probably should be more political than I am. I just don't care.","You're not gonna write a hundred songs and have a hundred entirely different ideas. It's a matter of finding the ones that are the freshest and most unique.","There are some commercial artists that have number one after number one, and you go to their show, and the show's one-note. Yeah, they're all hit songs. But there's no emotion, because they're the same kind of hit songs, because they're what works at radio. That kills live shows for me.","My favorite artists are the ones that I can take their eight or ten albums, and I can see the arc of their life.","I've always believed that you put everything into making the best record you can make, regardless of how you release it and regardless of the press and the hype - that the music wins.","I'm not an early riser; I'm a crack-of-noon guy.","Maybe it's oldest-child syndrome, but I have always been competitive, even as a kid with sports. It spills into my career.","When I'm cutting a tree, if I'm thinking about anything other than that 40-foot oak tree... I'm a dead man. It's a therapy thing for me.","I'd still stand in line all day to get into an AC/DC show, because that was the one show when I was younger that kind of changed my life. Because it was a little wrong. I think I was 14 or 15, first concert without the parents, you know, and they were all worried because we were going to an AC/DC show, and it was an amphitheater.","Coming up in bars and clubs, I would play anything that had a $20 bill attached to it. I did 'Like a Virgin' in a bar one time for a hundred bucks.","I grew up listening to The Band. I love Lowell George. I love Little Feat, and I was listening to some Springsteen, some of the deep album cuts. I just like the looseness of that kind of music. It all feels like they did it in one take. They let whatever happened happen. If it felt good, they kept it.","Country has become too homogenized and too commercial. It has lost what makes it special. It's great that it's popular, but then it starts to become watered down.","I went to Appalachian State University, which was very bluegrass- and folk-oriented.","I signed a baby's head one time, which I thought was an odd situation. I had a guy show me a tattoo one time, and he wanted me to sign the tattoo. So I signed the tattoo, and he went across the street and had the signature tattooed.","My dad was in furniture for 35 years. He got run out of furniture when everything went to China, went overseas. Manufacturing in the country broke down. Everything left.","When we go out there, I want to be the act that, no matter who's in that crowd, they've never seen a better act than me. I'm gonna empty the tank.","I'm not a big TV guy, but I love either 'Auction Hunters' or those repo shows on truTV. It's really just glorified 'Jerry Springer' is all it is. Every now and then, it's just mindless entertainment. We'll be on the bus, and we'll laugh at it. Those are my guilty pleasures.","The Wall Street Dow Jones up and down thing that's moving when the stock market's open? That thing freaks me out. It's up, it's down, it's just maddening to me. I guess I'm such a super-focused kind of person that I get distracted really easy. I'll watch that thing, and it's like I'm losing money, I'm getting money. It's just crazy.","I grew up in North Carolina, and they have a soft drink called Sun Drop. I love the diet version of it. It's the greatest thing on the face of the earth. I always have it in my fridge - bus fridge and home fridge."],"Eric Clapton":["The blues are what I've turned to, what has given me inspiration and relief in all the trials of my life.","An obsession is where something will not leave your mind.","I think everybody has their own way of looking at their lives as some kind of pilgrimage. Some people will see their role as a pilgrim in terms of setting up a fine family, or establishing a business inheritance. Everyone's got their own definition. Mine, I suppose, is to know myself.","I like solitude. I like the anomalous life. I like a quiet life.","But the guitar, when you think about it, is the most versatile, really. I mean you can pick it up and take it with you wherever you go.","I think everybody has their own way of looking at their lives as some kind of pilgrimage. Some people will see their role as a pilgrim in terms of setting up a fine family, or establishing a business inheritance. Everyone's got their own definition.","I mean, the sound of an amplified guitar in a room full of people was so hypnotic and addictive to me, that I could cross any kind of border to get on there.","When all the original blues guys are gone, you start to realize that someone has to tend to the tradition. I recognize that I have some responsibility to keep the music alive, and it's a pretty honorable position to be in.","Well, I think part of my gift, or if I have one, is that I love listening.","Given the choice between accomplishing something and just lying around, I'd rather lie around. No contest.","Very much like that, and very much a loner, do you know and I didn't fit really into sport or all kind of group activities as a kid, I couldn't find a niche. And music was not really part of the kind of village curriculum it would, you know.","I don't know if I believe in luck. I think I'm very fortunate.","I wish I could write easily. I'm one of those guys who's visited by the muse when things are dire.","They looked great, you know the drawings of the guys playing looked great and bits of string around their necks. So it didn't seem to be that difficult a thing to do, or that inaccessible.","One of the most beneficial things I've ever learned is how to keep my mouth shut.","Risk is trying to control something you are powerless over.","Music became a healer for me. And I learned to listen with all my being. I found that it could wipe away all the emotions of fear and confusion relating to my family.","I am, and always will be, a blues guitarist.","My dedication to my music has driven everyone away. I've had girlfriends, but I always end up on my own. I don't particularly like it, but I don't see a way 'round it.","I listened to King Oliver and I listened to Louis Armstrong, Jelly Roll Morton, Thelonious Monk, Charles Mingus, John Coltrane, Archie Shepp... I listened to everything I could that came from that place that they call the blues but, in formality, isn't necessarily the blues.","Music became a healer for me.","There's a desire in me to express something - to match what I hear in my head.","In playing, I suppose my greatest gift was to express the way I felt or the willingness to express myself.","I used to do crazy things that people would bail me out of, and I'm just grateful that I survived. But the music got very lost; I didn't know where I was going, and I didn't really care. I was more into just having a good time, and I think it showed.","I remember hearing Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee, Big Bill Broonzy, Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley and not really knowing anything about the geography or the culture of the music. But for some reason it did something to me - it resonated.","Yeah, and I went straight into a fantasy world. Just stepped straight into the abyss. You know, I was gone and kids used to walk past my front room, cause I lived on the green.","I'd love to knock an audience cold with one note, but what do you do for the rest of the evening?","From the beginning, I knew intuitively that if nothing else, music was safe, and that nobody could tell me anything about it. Music didn't need a middleman, whereas all the other things in school needed some kind of explanation.","I remember when I thought of singing as the bit that went between the guitar playing - something I couldn't wait to get out of the way. Singing was originally like a chore that I didn't really enjoy.","I feel a real need to observe a level of propriety in what I'm handing out. Instead of me just venting or spilling my guts, I've got to consider how it's going to affect people. How it's going to affect me, as well. Because it's like a cycle.","I sought my father in the world of the black musician, because it contained wisdom, experience, sadness and loneliness. I was not ever interested in the music of boys. From my youngest years, I was interested in the music of men.","My original interests and intentions in guitar playing were primarily created on quality of tone, for instance, the way the instrument could be made to echo or simulate the human voice.","I just like the company of beautiful women. I have a weakness in that department.","I tried when I was 13, when my grandparents gave me an acoustic guitar, and I tried for a year. It hurt so much to play. I mean, the fingertips hurt so much, I gave up.","I did play a lot of fingerstyle when I first started playing. I could never really find the right combination of flatpick or fingerpick, so playing fingerstyle is really the easiest way - though it's quite strenuous on the fingertips.","I just managed to convince my grandmother that it was a worth while that was something to do, you know, and when I did finally get the guitar, it didn't seem that difficult to me, to be able to make a good noise out of it.","The first one was quite cheap, but that was expensive for us. For my folks to buy on the Never Never. It was quite, you know, a rare object to have and I gained quite a lot of status by having this.","One summer I remember, I got exposed to Chuck Berry and Buddy Holly and Buddy Holly was a very very big, made a very big impression on me. Because of a lot of things, you know, the way he looked and his charisma.","Leave bands, go back to obscurity if I choose to, without a great sense of loss of security because it's all been based on the fact that I did it on my own or was doing, enjoying doing it on my own in the first place.","It was a mystery to me, how the tuning was, or the style seemed to come out of nowhere, it obviously had roots in America going way back, there was nothing like it for me I'd ever seen before.","It was stumbling on to really the bible of the blues, you know, and a very powerful drug to be introduced to us and I absorbed it totally, and it changed my complete outlook on music.","Yeah, I wanted to know where they got it from, what it was all about, you know, and it seemed to strike something in me that was you know rearing it's head and I still don't know what that is.","Oh yeah, I mean, it wasn't a very good guitar, most good guitars have got thrust rods in the necks that you can adjust or that'll keep them in shape, you know keep them straight. This one just, well it turned into a bow and arrow after a couple of months.","I mean, it didn't matter to me that there were people, it didn't matter that I was shy Just the sound was so captivating that it helped me to get rid of those inhibitions.","A British pressing with a compilation of the best stuff really, I mean actually not only that but, these were all kind of semi hits for the people on it in America.","I don't have half the nerves there that I have anywhere else.","Although they can do it all the time, you know, they're far better than me, on a musically, on a theoretical music level. You know, they're out of my league.","This moment in time, on this tour, you know, I'm discovering a lot of new things. And to be 45 and doing that, it's a mixture of pleasure and pain, I can assure you.","Yeah, it is, because it's a real discovery of your inner resources, you know. That's what my character is all about and what my playing is all about. But to get up there and just go inside and draw out something that makes you feel good first and foremost.","It's very dependent on your state of mind. And your emotional state as well. And a lot of it comes pouring out, you don't really have that much control with it.","I've got the god given talent or the god given opportunity better put, to let that out in a harmless way you know, and I don't know what it does to you, I don't really know.","The toughest thing about being a celebrity, I suppose, is being polite when I don't want to be.","But I did go to music really early on, even when I was 4 or 5, I was responding to music probably in ways other kids were not.","I just like the company of beautiful women. I have a weakness in that department. And I suppose because I am fairly well off and a famous musician, I'm up for grabs. And that makes me an eligible bachelor in the press.","I grew up playing in clubs - that's my spiritual stomping ground.","The point of being at home is to be with my family as much as possible.","'My Father's Eyes' is very personal. I realized that the closest I ever came to looking in my father's eyes was when I looked into my son's eyes.","It's taken me to be an older guy, an old man, to have an old man's voice. Because I only liked old men's voices. As a kid, I didn't like pip-squeaked singers.","To sing in a lower key is harder work. You have to use your diaphragm more.","The first band I identified with from Chicago was the Muddy Waters band.","I think I deliberately sold out a couple of times. I picked the songs that I thought would do well in the marketplace, even though I didn't really love the song.","I'm not a big fan of lead vocalists, people who sing but don't play. I never wanted to be in a band where the guy who was up front just sang. I've always thought it better when one of the musicians sings, like Steve Winwood.","I never met Johnny Rotten, and I didn't want to meet Johnny Rotten.","It is painful to relive things that have caused emotional crises or whatever and find ways to express that musically.","I often enjoy singing in an acoustic setting more than an amplified one.","When you're onstage with an electric band going through a massive P.A. system, it's very artificial. You can't really hear your own voice as it comes out of your mouth.","The first guitar I ever had was a gut-string Spanish guitar, and I couldn't really get the hang of it. I was only 13, and I talked my grandparents into buying it for me. I tried and tried and tried, but got nowhere with it."],"Eric Close":["The majority of the world - including myself - we all have problems and difficulty in life, and life's messy. But there are great rewards in life, too.","It's amazing to me how people throw stuff on the ground right next to a trash can. That drives me crazy.","It is beautiful in Vancouver; let's face it. I mean, you have the ocean. There's mountains.","I have friends that tease me about 'Without a Trace;' they say, 'You're really good at saying, 'Have you seen this person?'","I was a wild kid in high school. I liked to get crazy and be rebellious and go to parties and do all that kind of stuff.","I told my parents, 'You've taken care of me all my life, helped me through college. You've been awesome, but now it's my turn to be my own man.'","I just feel that God gave me a certain gift, and that was to go out, do storytelling and be an actor. And my responsibility with that gift is to do the best job possible and to re-create real life.","I'm always trying to look for different roles.","A lot of factors go into the longevity of a show.","The two most important words in marriage for me are 'yes, dear.'","I love country music.","I've always been a big fan of Nashville, and I have friends that live there.","I pick up other people's trash. I'm sort of obsessed.","The Monte Carlo TV Festival is great because it's a celebration of television and great storytelling.","If you looked at my iPod, you would get a trip out of all the different music, from the real heavy metal to bluegrass to classical.","John Denver I listened to when I was in elementary school.","I think love is blind. I hate to use that cliched statement, but people, when they love somebody, they seem to be able to somehow to put aside red flags."],"Eric D. Thomas":["Bottom line, I removed myself from the victim mentality and took control of my life. I'm not just going to take responsibility for the success in my life - I'm going to take responsibility for the failures in my life. When you're willing to accept that you're the problem, you immediately become the solution.","When you want to succeed as bad as you want breathe, then you will be successful.","Most kids just follow the cycle. My grandfather didn't finish high school. My father didn't, and I didn't. But you can break the cycle. You can have a successful marriage and be a good father.","People talk about how great this country is - and it's a great country - but I feel that many young people don't believe they have access to the American dream.","In my estimation, there are four kinds of people that live on this earth: average, good, great, and phenomenal. Phenomenal is like Mother Theresa. She's dead, but we still talk about her on a regular basis. That's phenomenal.","Do you know, if I go to a Jewish school, them kids are quiet. If I go to a white school, them kids quiet. If I go to a Latino school, they quiet. The only kids that disrespect me is black kids. That's it - my own are the only ones that disrespect me.","Listen to me carefully: My father wasn't in my life, but it feels good taking care of my kids.","Average people get to school late; they're average. They barely do their school work.","You can't take our people from Africa and put us in a diaspora and spread us all over the world. And we survived slavery - and we can't pass a test? ... And you're gonna tell me we can't learn how to write? Have you lost your mind? We are survivors. That's all we do is survive.","Most of the people that I deal with have no vision, and they live out the reality that's given to them."],"Eric Dane":["Sometimes I feel like I'm lacking a playfulness. I envy guys who are consistently able to maintain a playful, optimistic perspective on things.","My skin is very sensitive.","The action genre is not always the most synonymous with character development.","With a pilot, there's a lot of information that gets packed into 46 minutes or whatever it is. Usually what happens is that, throughout the season, you get to spend a little more quality time with the characters and get to know them a bit better, whether it's based on circumstance or relationships they've created with other characters.","I couldn't comprehend a 35-year-old woman gravitating toward a 70-year-old man.","Never ask a woman when she's due unless you know for a fact she's expecting.","I go eat a sandwich for lunch and have a milk shake and miss going to the gym for 10 days, and somebody snaps a picture of me on the beach, and all of a sudden, I've lost it. Why do I need to be perfect all the time?","On 'Grey's Anatomy,' I didn't have to move too much. I think I ran through the hospital three times.","I do like to cook. But I only cook a few things, but those few things I do really well.","I make really good chicken soup, sort of from scratch. I don't make my own stock. I just use a base like a chicken stock, but everything else, all the ingredients, I do on my own.","Television is a lot of fun. It's faster-paced. The schedule is really desirable, I guess. But as far as films go, and I've only done a couple; film is like a definitive beginning, middle and end. You know your character's arch.","Some of the greatest actors on the planet are the most insecure people. Now I don't know if that insecurity necessarily equates to a lack of confidence. Some people are just very shy individuals. You give them a character to play and a script, and you put them in front of a camera or on a stage, and they just go.","I don't know if there's any change more significant that a human being can make than that of a woman becoming a mother. There's no change more dramatic.","I'm out of bed before the alarm goes off.","I'm a goal setter, but in broad strokes. I don't have a by-October-2009-I-want-to-be-here plan. All I do is work with an element of challenge and an element of enjoyment. With that, anything can happen.","Going to the gym and looking for a specific result is a short-lived existence, as opposed to going to the gym and adopting it as a lifestyle. Develop a routine, because it's much harder to break it if you have one. If you have no routine, you have nothing to break, so discipline goes out the window.","I'm not a big watcher of myself. You start looking at things you shouldn't be looking at that have nothing to do with anything of importance.","I like lifting weights. And there is a cardio element to lifting if you're doing it the way I do it.","If I can get to the gym 3-4 days a week and spend 50 minutes to an hour and a half, irrespective of whether I lift something or not, I'm getting in shape.","My father served in Vietnam - the respect I have for the Navy is profound.","Any free time I have, the family comes first.","I think when you're done with work, you go home.","I always thought of myself as a big-dog kinda guy.","McSteamy's been really good to me. He's opened a lot of doors.","I loved doing 'Grey's Anatomy.'","I can't say no to my girls. They melt my heart. I'm very grateful for my family.","I'm a hands-on dad.","Being a parent is the toughest thing I've ever done. But I'm not the kind of person to throw my kid in front of a TV. I'm the one to take out a book, puzzle, or flash cards.","I never had a family, and now I do. I know I'm a very lucky guy.","We've all made mistakes.","What I love about acting is experiencing the absolute moments of - you know - of getting lost in the world you've created for yourself.","I like guys who, no matter what, are men.","I've always had a great feel for space and how objects occupy it.","There's a very mathematical, mechanical side to architecture, and I probably lean more toward that aspect of it, though I'm terrible at numbers. But that side appeals to me more than the decorating aspect.","I grew up in Northern California on the peninsula. It was a beautiful house, but it was very traditional. It wasn't midcentury modern. I'm talking 1970s, early '80s - design didn't even go 'Wall Street' until, like, 1986.","I've never seen 'Game of Thrones.' I've never seen 'Breaking Bad.' I can't tell you one character outside of Walter White.","Love at first sight is different when you're 32 than when you're 22. In your early 20s, you fall in love after three weeks.","At the end of the day, you want to work with people you want to work with - regardless of what they've done. Being able to spend 15 hours on a set with somebody and enjoy every minute of it - that's what it's really about.","I just try to leave my baggage at the door. I don't want to carry my stuff into a working environment with me, and I expect that from other people. If they can't do it, though, I'm surprisingly understanding.","The person I am is who I am. My life is my career, my career is my life."],"Eric Darnell":["I studied science and journalism at the University of Colorado and then got interested in experimental film there and started doing my own films.","I loved to watch cartoons and even made little stop-motion films in the backyard. At the time, I never really thought that it was something you could do for a living; it never actually hit me that people do that sort of thing or I would be capable of it.","We're lucky enough, especially in these 'Madagascar' films, to be working with some of the best people in the industry, who are not only great actors, but great comedians and improvisers and filmmakers. And they then become a part of creating their characters."],"Eric Davis":["Life is too short to worry about anything. You had better enjoy it because the next day promises nothing.","It takes a lot of energy to be negative. You have to work at it. But smiling is painless. I'd rather spend my energy smiling.","I'm having a good time. I'm going to treat every game and every day as if they are my last because I now know that they could be.","Never give up and don't ask why because every situation does not need an answer. I'm a firm believer that I don't worry about anything I can't control.","People spend time worrying about things they think they have to have and lose perception of what they do have. You can have all the money and material things you want. If you aren't here to enjoy them, what good do they do?","I don't listen to what people say about me and I don't read what they write about me. People can compare me to anyone they want to, but I'm not going to worry about it.","I don't think any player lives up to his potential, because people out there put you so high on a pedestal, you'll never be as good as they expect.","I'm being compared to the impossible. I never saw Mays, Aaron or Clemente play. What about the people I face every day? Tim Raines is the best? Mattingly is the best? Why not compare me to my peers?","If you don't believe in something, you'll fall for anything. I believe everything happens for a reason. If you are strong from within, you can will anything. I'm a firm believer that where there's a will, there's a way.","For me to become the highest paid player in the franchise, it was something I didn't anticipate. But I'm glad. I like playing for Cincinnati.","Circulating through the children's ward and seeing terminally ill kids, heads shaved, smiling and having a ball despite the tubes and needles sticking into them, I thought: What do I have to worry about? If God takes me, at least I've lived for 35 years.","If you're feeling pressure, then you shouldn't be here.","I could've played basketball, but my mind was on baseball. I didn't know what I was in for. In high school it was a matter of talent. No one told you what to do.","Baseball is not what I love. It's my job.","I don't want to be famous. I want to be secure. I don't want the world. I just want a piece of it. I want people to remember Eric Davis.","I've been operated on 13 times.","You can't get more appreciation than that, to be elected by the fans. That's the ultimate, really.","I remember in 1990, there were five of us making $3 million a year. When guys passed us, we didn't cry. Why would we cry? You didn't get mad when someone got $6 million. Or $8 million.","It's like, now you're actually complaining because you're making $9 million and guys are making more? If it makes you that upset, quit. Leave the game. Go home then and try finding another job that's going to pay you that.","Come on, when does it come to the point where your name can't come up in trade talks? Willie Mays got traded. Pedro Martinez got traded. So what? That's part of the game.","I love the game, it's the greatest game on earth, that's why I can't understand all of this talk about trying to make the game better. People talk about the high strike zone and changing this and that. Why? To speed up the game? That's the beauty of baseball. There is no time element.","People saw me as being heroic, but I was no more heroic than I was with other injuries I had, like the lacerated kidney I suffered during the 1990 World Series. It's just that people haven't known anyone with a lacerated kidney, but everyone can relate to someone with cancer.","I was able to get operated on four days after I was diagnosed. It was just a matter of getting this baseball-sized tumor out of me. I reflect now on how lucky I was to be in the situation where I could get the best possible help and treatment.","That's just my family's mentality. We are a very loving, hugging and kissing kind of family. And we grew up in a church atmosphere and still have that atmosphere. There is no negativity.","Nothing I did contributed to me having cancer, so I can't sit back and say, 'Oh why me.' Why not me? Why does tragedy always have to hit someone else?","I'm no different than others with cancer. I just happen to play professional baseball. I'm part of those statistics that cancer has touched as well.","I don't even take aspirin.","I have figured out it's not what you do on the field, it's how many games you play in.","Everyone would like to play in their hometown, but right now I like Cincinnati, I like the way it's going. I'm happy.","I've been hearing this since I first joined the Reds organization, that I'm going to be the next this or that. It's tough on a young player coming up. You show some positive things and everybody jumps on that and says you should be the next Willie Mays.","I want to establish myself as the first Eric Davis, not the next Willie Mays.","The last two times I went to spring training, I had to win a job, and if I didn't get off to a blazing start, I'm on the bench. Now, I've proven myself, so it's not essential that I get off to a real good start.","People always ask me how I can hit the ball so far, and I say, 'I just swing.' It's the coaches who first told me I had good bat speed. I was just swinging, and I guess it was fast. I'm pretty fast at everything.","I was disappointed in everything - my start and the team's start. People got down on me, but I never got down on myself. I still believed I could be the type of player everyone, including me, thought I was going to be.","My only goal is to play 162 games and help this team win. If I can do that, everything will take care of itself.","You don't protect Mark McGwire. The only way to protect him is hit 70 homers yourself.","There's only one Mark McGwire. The man walked over 160 times. Just think. If he walks 60 times, he might hit 100 homers.","It's easy to see why pitchers respect McGwire. If you hit behind him, they're saying that they don't respect you. You have to change their thinking.","I was hitting .360 when I was diagnosed. I didn't forget how to play while I was recovering. I don't know if the cancer is gone for good. I don't think anyone ever knows, but no one is going to steal my joy for as along as I'm able to play baseball.","I know people are pretty well embarrassed just at the mention of colon cancer. Sticking a tube in you to find out what's wrong is not a nice thing. But I can tell them, a 30- or 40-minute test is worth it. We have to make them feel more comfortable about getting screened.","I'd never heard of colon cancer. Baseball wasn't even important to me. I have a wife and two girls. That's what was important. The doctors told me and all I could say was, 'When are we going to get this thing out?'","I ate while I was taking chemo. The doctors didn't know. I really didn't get any nausea. I didn't have side effects. I would be drained for a day and a half.","You can't shelter it. You can't hide it. You have to let people know what you're going through, what you're feeling, what you think you have that's a problem.","I'll have a stamp on me forever. There will always be questions. I brought new fans to the Orioles' organization, and that's good.","Most of the places I've been, I've been a main piece of the puzzle.","When you get back on the field and do things, any doubts you've developed leave. The more consistent you become, the fewer doubts you have.","I was fortunate to play for Pete Rose and have teammates like Ken Griffey Sr., Tony Perez and Dave Concepcion. I grew up in the game with a mature attitude. I've always known it was better to be seen and not heard.","I'm not head-strong, and I'm not egotistical. I understand certain things better now. I won't be trying to be play everyday. There's only one Cal Ripken, one Lou Gehrig and one Joe DiMaggio. What is good for them isn't necessarily good for Eric Davis.","I will be a role model for cancer patients for the rest of my life. But you know what? When I was getting chemo, those people inspired me.","Not being re-signed in Baltimore was probably the lowest point, mentally, of my career. That city was the only place where I wanted to be at the time, based on everything that had transpired.","Just putting my uniform on keeps me going. Being able to get out there keeps me going. That's the best therapy."],"Eric Dickerson":["When they have their hands on their knees, that's when they're tired.","I believe if I stay tall and run up high, I can see better.","I was raised by my great-great aunt. I was adopted within our family. My mother had me when she was, I think, 15, 16. They tried to get her to have an abortion and she refused. So, my 'mama' adopted me, which was really her great aunt, which was really my great-great aunt, who was named Viola Dickerson. I was told that my mother was my sister.","I'm just not the outgoing bubble of energy. But if I know you, it's different. Practical jokes. Have fun. I'm not looking for any new friends. I got my friends.","I'll tell you one thing about me: I'm very private. I always have been private. People think I'm callous, arrogant. I didn't like the media attention.","I love being single. I can come and go as I please and stay out as late as I want to.","She told me I wasn't playing for the coach, I was playing for myself.","Most of the hits I take come on top of the shoulder pads.","I'd love to be in the Hall of Fame one day and win Super Bowl rings, or even one... and stay healthy.","I run upright mostly when I see daylight, so if you watch film you'll see I don't get hit in the chest much.","I don't give players a chance to hit me.","In the NFL, you have a short shelf life. As a running back, if you're the first pick, and you're NFL life expectancy is only 3.5-6 years, your first big contract might not come until three years in - well, you might never get there. They need to get those signing bonuses up front because nothing is guaranteed.","In the NFL they talk about 'contracts,' but it's not really a contract, it's a one year agreement. If you have a 10 year contract, it means nothing. If you get cut in the NFL, you get nothing. People don't talk about that.","I love golf. But do you know how I got good at golf? Because of Charles Barkley. I was playing with Charles, Michael Jordan and Roy Green, and Charles was talking so much trash. On every shot, he was talking trash. So I left the tournament, and I went and practiced for a year and half.","I've stayed buddies with my old buddy Jackie Slater. I talk to Jackie Slater. I play golf with Marcus Allen a lot. I play golf with Marshall Faulk a lot. My buddy Craig Young, he lives up in New Mexico. I still talk to a lot of the guys.","Them sportswriters don't even know how to put uniforms on, most of 'em.","I don't love football the way I once loved the game. I don't look at it as fun anymore, and it definitely used to be fun. A lot of the fun has been taken away from it, I guess, because you go through so much on the field and off the field.","Playing the running back position, your legs, that's your living, that's how you make your living. You have to have great thighs, knees, everything.","The perfect fit for L.A. would be the St. Louis Rams. I really believe that. I know their stadium deal is about expired, or it is expired. They're working through that. I think it would be the old Los Angeles Rams in town.","When you look at guys who get recruited, most of the best athletes, they come from poor families. I don't forget. I was a junior looking through my mother's stuff and looked at her bank statement, and we had $30 in the bank.","I think I'm proudest of making my parents proud.","Running is so natural to me. When I was running track, people used to ask me, 'When are you gonna start running hard?' The wind hits me in the face, and I feel so smooth... Man, I love to run!","Anything will worry me. I may not get a check for the light bill off in time and I just get to worrying. I'm a worrywart."],"Eric Fellner":["You can't develop a great car and sell it as an independent. You can develop a great car and make a deal with Mercedes.","'Billy Elliot' embodies the idea that anyone can achieve anything regardless of their socio-economic background.","There's so much competition for leisure time, more than ever.","You can get swept away by a musical, but real tears are rare.","I think it would be a good thing in the creative community if there was less embarrassment of this word 'commercial' because that's how you make a business.","For us in England, the relative value of the pound against the dollar, that has a huge impact on how easy it is to get our films made in the U.K.","The more you keep costs down, the more freedom you have creatively.","My theory is, I don't know how long it's going to be, five or ten years, there will be only two ways to see a movie, and that will either be on your computer through your TV screen or in the cinema, end of story. There will be no DVD; that's it - simple.","Technical problems are like gremlins. They come and go.","It's fantastic to see 'Les Miserables' become the top-grossing film at the U.K. box office.","Film is not a national business. It's international. And its centre will always be Hollywood.","The U.K. needs more first class studio space to encourage the growth of the film and TV sector.","'No Country for Old Men' was epic.","When you watch a Coen brothers movie, it is always so certain about what it is trying to portray. That is their strength. The minute they write a word, they know how it will look on-screen. They are very purposeful, with no kind of mistakes.","I think Cannes is usually pretty fair in choosing what will play well to the home festival crowd.","Apart from 'Stoned,' I can't think of a film that's made me think, 'Blimey, that should have been at Cannes.'","I have always thought we should think less about the British film industry as an entity, and more about getting British talent working.","The idea that the Tony committee and the New York theater community as a whole have embraced 'Billy Elliot' is very, very exciting.","It is rare that you read scripts that genuinely move you and make you feel that, regardless of the commercial possibilities, you have to make the film.","'Billy Elliot' prides itself on being a family show, and it made sense to specifically cater to a family audience with an earlier evening curtain time.","The writer Richard Curtis is a genius.","Making movies is like herding cats.","Somebody has to invest in creating the movies of the future.","Do we have good writers, producers and actors in the U.K.? Yes we do.","Mike Leigh and Ken Loach are the people I look up to. They are quality film-makers making interesting, controversial, ground-breaking movies with very little eye on the marketplace.","If there's a British film in the marketplace that is successful on a worldwide basis - whether it's 'A Room with a View,' 'Four Weddings' or 'The Full Monty' - money follows, and everyone tries to emulate that success.","It might sound a small thing, but if you want to get Tom Cruise into your movie, without a track record or without those agents knowing you, it's almost impossible. Now I can get through to pretty much anyone I want. Of course, 90 per cent of the time they still say no.","I'm a blind optimist when going into things.","With 'Anna Karenina,' I just think it's a stunning visual tour de force for a director who is at the top of his game.","You never get time at Working Title, sadly, to enjoy any film's success, because you're worrying about the next lot."],"Eric Fischl":["I hate this idea that there are some people who have a right to express their suffering and others who don't, that there are those in this hierarchy of pain who own it more than you do.","I think making art is something where you think you know, you also know you don't know and you hope - all these things are in play all the time. I think it's what makes the excitement of creativity for the artist.","My primary thing is to make a painting, not necessarily to make a painting to sell for gazillions of dollars, but just to make a painting.","Artists don't really want to be marginalized. They believe that everybody should be able to appreciate the experience that an artist gives them, an experience that connects us to each other in a deep way.","The truth is that painting is all about scale; you use scale to create experience. A lot of artists have lost that ability. They don't even know that's something they should be doing."],"Eric Flint":["The 'Heirs of Alexandria' series mixes the Renaissance with magic and demons, based on a changed theological history.","Poul Anderson's 'The High Crusade' may have had a greater impact on my development as a writer than any other book I ever read.","By the time I was twenty-three, I'd given up any thought of becoming a fiction writer, and I didn't return to the craft for over two decades. But, at the age of forty-five, return I did.","My first published novel was 'Mother of Demons,' which is simply 'The High Crusade' standing on its head. Poul Anderson placed his medieval human heroes in a futuristic alien setting; I placed my futuristic human heroes in a bronze age alien setting."],"Eric Gill":["Art is skill, that is the first meaning of the word.","Science is analytical, descriptive, informative. Man does not live by bread alone, but by science he attempts to do so. Hence the deadliness of all that is purely scientific.","Without philosophy man cannot know what he makes; without religion he cannot know why."],"Eric Heiden":["In general, I enjoy athletes who have a strong character who let their abilities speak for themselves.","I'm not a big fan of those who are egotistical and so outspoken.","I really liked it best when I was a nobody.","When I was skating you had to participate in every thing.","Cyclists, I work with a number of cyclists. They are great athletes; they are great aerobic athletes. If you ask them to hit a baseball or golf ball, they can't do that.","Heck, gold medals, what can you do with them?","I didn't get into skating to be famous.","I have a very close friendship with the skaters.","I mean you got to thank your parents for giving you the right genes.","I would recommend anybody who gets a chance to see short track skating, make it a point to go out there when Apolo is skating because you won't see anybody better.","I'd rather get a nice warmup suit. That's something I can use. Gold medals just sit there. When I get old, maybe I could sell them if I need the money.","Immediately after the Olympics, I was pretty fatigued.","It's not a sport you get famous at. If I wanted to be famous, I would have stuck with hockey.","One thing is having skated five of the best races I've probably could have skated. It was nice to peak at the right time and to do it in an important time in somebody's career.","Sports and politics don't mix.","Then going out on the ice usually about 15 minutes before and certain things I would do for the different races, aspects that you run through your mind.","They're just big in the eyes of the American public.","We had a party with the rest of the skaters in our trailer and then the next day we were off to see Jimmy Carter. And then we had the World Championships the next weekend, so not a lot of chance to catch up.","We never did a lot of weights, but a lot of repetitions. The most I would use doing squats was 300 pounds.","We used to lift weights a couple of times a week, we did a lot of running. I enjoyed the variety.","You don't really want to load up a whole lot, probably anything more than four hours before the race. I needed something to make me feel full, but I certainly didn't want it to make me feel stuffed.","You got to get lucky because it lasts for a week and a lot of things can happen in a week."],"Eric Hill":["I consider myself very fortunate indeed to have created a character which has captured the imagination and enthusiasm of so many children worldwide. They are my family, and Spot belongs to them all.","I am quite convinced now... that the actual training of drawing cartoons - which is, of course, my style - led to my producing Spot. Cartoons must be very simple and have as few words as possible, and so, too, must the 'Spot' books.","I'm not over-enamored of complicated books, and wonder if it's more for the author's ego than anything else?","As a child, during the war, I drew Spitfires and Messerschmitts. With Spot, I found that I had designed a fuselage! His spot is on his side, the roundel marking of an English fighter plane, and the color bar of his tail is the color stripes of a plane's rudder."],"Eric Hobsbawm":["As the global expansion of Indian and Chinese restaurants suggests, xenophobia is directed against foreign people, not foreign cultural imports.","Utopianism is probably a necessary social device for generating the superhuman efforts without which no major revolution is achieved.","It seems that American patriotism measures itself against an outcast group. The right Americans are the right Americans because they're not like the wrong Americans, who are not really Americans.","Nations without a past are contradictions in terms. What makes a nation is the past, what justifies one nation against others is the past, and historians are the people who produce it.","There is not much that even the most socially responsible scientists can do as individuals, or even as a group, about the social consequences of their activities."],"Eric Hoffer":["Someone who thinks the world is always cheating him is right. He is missing that wonderful feeling of trust in someone or something.","Kindness can become its own motive. We are made kind by being kind.","Our passionate preoccupation with the sky, the stars, and a God somewhere in outer space is a homing impulse. We are drawn back to where we came from.","Propaganda does not deceive people; it merely helps them to deceive themselves.","The suspicious mind believes more than it doubts. It believes in a formidable and ineradicable evil lurking in every person.","Social improvement is attained more readily by a concern with the quality of results than with the purity of motives.","Children are the keys of paradise.","Disappointment is a sort of bankruptcy - the bankruptcy of a soul that expends too much in hope and expectation.","Creativity is the ability to introduce order into the randomness of nature.","In times of change learners inherit the earth; while the learned find themselves beautifully equipped to deal with a world that no longer exists.","To become different from what we are, we must have some awareness of what we are.","It is not actual suffering but the taste of better things which excites people to revolt.","Compassion alone stands apart from the continuous traffic between good and evil proceeding within us.","We feel free when we escape - even if it be but from the frying pan to the fire.","We can be absolutely certain only about things we do not understand.","It still holds true that man is most uniquely human when he turns obstacles into opportunities.","When people are bored it is primarily with themselves.","The search for happiness is one of the chief sources of unhappiness.","It is the malady of our age that the young are so busy teaching us that they have no time left to learn.","Faith in a holy cause is to a considerable extent a substitute for lost faith in ourselves.","It would be difficult to exaggerate the degree to which we are influenced by those we influence.","People who bite the hand that feeds them usually lick the boot that kicks them.","Every new adjustment is a crisis in self-esteem.","The leader has to be practical and a realist, yet must talk the language of the visionary and the idealist.","The only way to predict the future is to have power to shape the future.","The savior who wants to turn men into angels is as much a hater of human nature as the totalitarian despot who wants to turn them into puppets.","The hardest arithmetic to master is that which enables us to count our blessings.","It is the child in man that is the source of his uniqueness and creativeness, and the playground is the optimal milieu for the unfolding of his capacities and talents.","The misery of a child is interesting to a mother, the misery of a young man is interesting to a young woman, the misery of an old man is interesting to nobody.","An empty head is not really empty; it is stuffed with rubbish. Hence the difficulty of forcing anything into an empty head.","It almost seems that nobody can hate America as much as native Americans. America needs new immigrants to love and cherish it.","We are least open to precise knowledge concerning the things we are most vehement about.","Passionate hatred can give meaning and purpose to an empty life.","Our greatest pretenses are built up not to hide the evil and the ugly in us, but our emptiness. The hardest thing to hide is something that is not there.","Rudeness is a weak imitation of strength.","Craving, not having, is the mother of a reckless giving of oneself.","We lie loudest when we lie to ourselves.","Wise living consists perhaps less in acquiring good habits than in acquiring as few habits as possible.","A grievance is most poignant when almost redressed.","It is a sign of creeping inner death when we can no longer praise the living.","Nationalist pride, like other variants of pride, can be a substitute for self-respect.","We are more prone to generalize the bad than the good. We assume that the bad is more potent and contagious.","The best part of the art of living is to know how to grow old gracefully.","When cowardice is made respectable, its followers are without number both from among the weak and the strong; it easily becomes a fashion.","Where everything is possible miracles become commonplaces, but the familiar ceases to be self-evident.","The beginning of thought is in disagreement - not only with others but also with ourselves.","Our sense of power is more vivid when we break a man's spirit than when we win his heart.","It is the awareness of unfulfilled desires which gives a nation the feeling that it has a mission and a destiny.","Dissipation is a form of self-sacrifice.","Those in possession of absolute power can not only prophesy and make their prophecies come true, but they can also lie and make their lies come true.","There is probably an element of malice in our readiness to overestimate people - we are, as it were, laying up for ourselves the pleasure of later cutting them down to size.","You can never get enough of what you don't need to make you happy.","Call not that man wretched, who whatever ills he suffers, has a child to love.","Whenever you trace the origin of a skill or practices which played a crucial role in the ascent of man, we usually reach the realm of play.","There would be no society if living together depended upon understanding each other.","One of the marks of a truly vigorous society is the ability to dispense with passion as a midwife of action - the ability to pass directly from thought to action.","A great man's greatest good luck is to die at the right time.","To the old, the new is usually bad news.","We used to think that revolutions are the cause of change. Actually it is the other way around: change prepares the ground for revolution.","We are told that talent creates its own opportunities. But it sometimes seems that intense desire creates not only its own opportunities, but its own talents.","The individual who has to justify his existence by his own efforts is in eternal bondage to himself.","A dissenting minority feels free only when it can impose its will on the majority: what it abominates most is the dissent of the majority.","Our frustration is greater when we have much and want more than when we have nothing and want some. We are less dissatisfied when we lack many things than when we seem to lack but one thing.","The real Antichrist is he who turns the wine of an original idea into the water of mediocrity.","To know a person's religion we need not listen to his profession of faith but must find his brand of intolerance.","We all have private ails.

I think that there is still a need for a dialogue about things racial that we've not engaged in.","While he was in the service, in the South and in Oklahoma, he was refused service at a couple of places where he was in uniform, and was told that African Americans, blacks, Negros, were not served. And in spite of that, I've never known a man who loved this country more than my father did.","I was raised - professionally - in the Public Integrity Section.

But there's still more we have to travel along this road so we get to the place that is consistent with our founding ideals.","Though this nation has proudly thought of itself as an ethnic melting pot, in things racial we have always been and continue to be, in too many ways, essentially a nation of cowards.","I am not a proponent of the death penalty, but I will enforce the law as this Congress gives it to us.","In a lot of ways, civil rights division is the conscience of the Justice Department. You can almost measure what kind of Justice Department you have by what kind of civil rights division that you have.","I urge the citizens of Ferguson who have been peacefully exercising their First Amendment rights to join with law enforcement in condemning the actions of looters, vandals and others seeking to inflame tensions and sow discord.","Though race-related issues continue to occupy a significant portion of our political discussion, and though there remain many unresolved racial issues in this nation, we, average Americans, simply do not talk enough with each other about things racial.","Any decision to use lethal force against a United States citizen - even one intent on murdering Americans and who has become an operational leader of al-Qaida in a foreign land - is among the gravest that government leaders can face.","I'm a hard headed lawyer.","One of the things I learned is that you've got to deal with the underlying social problems if you want to have an impact on crime - that it's not a coincidence that you see the greatest amount of violent crime where you see the greatest amount of social dysfunction.","Operation Fast and Furious was flawed in concept and flawed in execution. The tactics used in this operation violate Department of Justice policy and should never have been used.","This is going to be a very transparent Justice Department. But I'm not gonna sacrifice the safety of the American people or our ability to protect the American homeland.","In January 2013, I told the people in the Justice Department after the re-election that I wanted to focus on reforming the federal criminal justice system. I made an announcement in August of that year in San Francisco, when we rolled out the Smart on Crime initiative.","Due process and judicial process are not one and the same, particularly when it comes to national security.","I don't even talk about whether or not racial profiling is legal. I just don't think racial profiling is a particularly good law enforcement tool.","The inability to pass reasonable gun safety laws after the Newtown massacre is something that weighs heavily on my mind.","Michael Brown's tragic death has revealed a deep distrust between some in the Ferguson community and its police force. It also developed a need to develop and widely disseminate law enforcement best practices for responding to public demonstrations.","Saturdays and Sundays, America in the year 2009 does not in some ways differ significantly from the country that existed almost 50 years ago. This is truly sad.","The reality is that we will be reading Miranda rights to the corpse of Osama bin Laden. He will never appear in an American courtroom. That's the reality. He will be killed by us, or he will be killed by his own people so he's not captured by us. We know that.","I think that what I'm doing is right. And election-year politics, which intensifies everything, is not going to drive me off that course.","I think that people, despite my law enforcement background, view me as taking these consistently progressive stands, and I think that, philosophically, there is a desire to get at that person. But I think the stands I have taken are totally consistent with a person who is looking at things realistically, factually.","You constantly hear about voter fraud... but you don't see huge amounts of vote fraud out there.","The Constitution guarantees due process, not judicial process.","I actually think that the dotting of the i's and the crossing of the t's is what separates the United States, the United Kingdom, our allies, from those who we are fighting.","One cannot understate the importance of eliminating Bin Laden. He was a symbolic head of the organisation and, as we now know, an operational head of the organisation.","We are not programmed to bury our kids.","It pains me whenever there's the death of a law enforcement official.","I don't have any intention of resigning.","I'm not going to let people who work in the United States Department of Justice have their characters be assailed without any basis.","I understand the Second Amendment. I respect the Second Amendment. I think we need to use common sense tools to keep the American people safe, to keep our streets safe.","I look forward to working with the NRA to come up with ways in which we can use common sense approaches to reduce the level of violence that we see - in our streets, and make the American people as safe as they possibly can be.","Well, I think the American people have to understand that the Mexican government is committed, in a very substantial way, to eradicating the effect of the impact of the cartels on Mexico. We have - what are called vetted units down there. Units that have been vetted by our law enforcement people there, the people with whom we deal - primarily.","Guantanamo is a chief recruiting tool for al-Qaida. It has put a wedge between the United States and at least some of its allies.","It's a sad indication of where Washington has come, where policy differences almost necessarily become questions of integrity. I came to Washington in the late '70s, and people had the ability in the past to have intense policy differences but didn't feel the need to question the other person's character.","The threat has changed from simply worrying about foreigners coming here, to worrying about people in the United States, American citizens - raised here, born here, and who for whatever reason, have decided that they are going to become radicalized and take up arms against the nation in which they were born.","There are a whole variety of reasons I want to be attorney general, a whole variety of things that I do as attorney general that go beyond national security.","Whether it is an attempt to bomb the New York City subway system, an attempt to bring down an airplane over Detroit, an attempt to set off a bomb in Times Square... I think that gives us a sense of the breadth of the challenges that we face, and the kinds of things that our enemy is trying to do.","I'm a 21st-century guy, secure in who I am.","I'm attorney general of the United States. I will not stand for - I will not allow people to take away that which people gave their lives to give, and that is the ability for the American people to vote.","If you want to call me an activist attorney general, I will proudly accept that label.","Any attorney general who is not an activist is not doing his or her job.","The responsibility of the attorney general is to change things and bring us closer to the ideals expressed in our founding documents.","It is the thing that keeps me up at night - the notion that you have individuals in the United States who are looking at computer screens and who are becoming radicalized.","When it comes to police officers, I have concerns about the training that they receive. This whole notion of implicit bias, looking at people and having stereotypical reactions to them on the basis of their ethnicity.","Communities of color don't understand what it means to be a police officer, the fear that police officers have in just being on the streets.","I still think that we have a hesitance to talk about things racial. And I think we do it at our detriment. We go from incident to incident, and we have spikes in which race becomes something that we talk about, as opposed to talking about race in those less contentious times when I think we might make more progress.","I have loved the Department of Justice ever since, as a young boy, I watched Robert Kennedy prove during the Civil Rights Movement how the department can - and must - always be a force for that which is right.","I grew up in the Justice Department. I served 12 years as a line lawyer in the public integrity section. This department under me will not have any kind of political interference. I will not allow political interference in the Justice Department. Those who might attempt to do that will be rebuffed.","Although the attorney general is a part of the president's team, you're really separate and apart. You have a special responsibility as the nation's chief law enforcement officer. There has to be a distance that you keep - between this department and the White House.","I'd like to continue being involved with issues that animated my time as attorney general - criminal-justice reform and civil rights especially. I don't just want to give speeches; I'd like to involve myself in this work in a systematic way.","I think there are too many people in jail for too long and for not necessarily good reasons.","I think one of the things that I don't think people focus on is that there are some red states that have done some really innovative things when it comes to criminal justice reform, including on rehabilitation, reentry efforts. I think one of the things that we have seen in that regard is that you save money.","I'm a prosecutor first and foremost, and as a judge, I put people in jail for extended periods of time when that was appropriate.","Smart on Crime says if you commit violent crimes, you should go to jail, and go to jail for extended periods of time. For people who are engaged in non-violent crimes - any crimes, for that matter - we are looking for sentences that are proportionate to the conduct that you engaged in.","If I were attorney general in Kansas in 1953, I would not have defended a Kansas statute that put in place separate-but-equal facilities.","Kids who I grew up with, who I played ball with, basketball, baseball, and went to parties with - for whatever reason - they ended up in a fundamentally different place than I did. I'm the attorney general of the United States and they are ex-felons.","The full resources of the Department of Justice have been committed to the investigation into Michael Brown's death.","As the brother of a retired law enforcement officer, I know firsthand that our men and women in uniform perform their duties in the face of tremendous threats and significant personal risk. They put their lives on the line every day, and they often have to make split-second decisions.","Enforcement priorities and arrest patterns must not lead to disparate treatment under the law, even if such treatment is unintended. And police forces should reflect the diversity of the communities they serve.","I am the attorney general of the United States, but I am also a black man.","Those who peacefully gather to express sympathy for the family of Michael Brown must have their rights respected at all times. And journalists must not be harassed or prevented from covering a story that needs to be told.","Studies show that if people think that they are treated fairly by the police, that matters almost more than what the result is. If you get stopped for a traffic stop and feel that you are treated courteously and fairly, you are much more likely to accept the fact that you got a speeding ticket.","History simmers beneath the surface in more communities than just Ferguson.","On a personal level, I've seen a lot in my time as attorney general, but few things have affected me as greatly as my visit to Ferguson. I had the chance to meet with the family of Michael Brown. I spoke to them not just as attorney general but as a father of a teenage son myself.","Ferguson and St. Louis County are not the first places that we have become engaged to ensure fair and equitable policing, and they will not be the last. The Department of Justice will continue to work tirelessly to ensure that the Constitution has meaning for all communities.","Displays of force in response to mostly peaceful demonstrations can be counterproductive."],"Eric Idle":["I have been very blessed in my life and rewarded with good friends and good health. I am grateful and happy to be able to share this.","Nobody gets irony anymore, as we are now living in the post-ironic age. Once George Bush gets a library, our irony is dead.","A website can be very time-intensive, but I'd love to have one where people can contribute to it - like invent islands and make their own flags, and their own laws. I think that'd be kind of fun.","Americans like to think 'Python' is how English people really are. There is an element of truth to that.","We've discovered that the less we do, the more money we make.","My education was paid for by the RAF Benevolent Fund, so a charity school, run like an orphanage, with uniforms and beatings. It was tough, but it got me to Cambridge - like being a chrysalis suddenly becoming a butterfly.","Life is a comedy when watching and a tragedy when experiencing. I try and share anything I have.","Life took over 4 billion years to evolve into you, and you've about 70 more years to enjoy it. Don't just pursue happiness, catch it.","People can tell the truth much more freely when they're apparently lying.","I do pool exercises, like weightlifting but underwater. I walk, I swim... I'm pretty fit for an old bloke.","Talent is always more interesting - ambition is not interesting. If you have talent, you have to find ways of expressing it, but you may not be a success in the world's terms.","You initially become funny as a kid because you're looking for attention and love. Psychologists think that's all to do with mother abandonment. I think John Cleese has his depressions, and Terry Gilliam's the same. All of us together make one completely insane person.","No day of my life passes without someone saying the words 'Monty Python' to me. It's not bad.","John Cleese once told me he'd do anything for money. So I offered him a pound to shut up, and he took it.","At least in America, you have freedom of speech, which is a good thing. It's just a question of whether you're allowed to use it on 'Fox News'.","To me, the musical is best when it's a musical comedy. So if you have a very, very funny show, and very good, funny songs, that's what the musical does best.","I like the idea of being out there regularly with an audience and with a funny gang of people. That's what I grew up with - doing television, doing shows every week.","I'm more surprised than anyone that 'Spamalot's done so well. You can never predict what's going to be a hit.","I won't read scripts because I have a limited amount of time. Why should I help other people do lame stuff when I can just go out and put on lame stuff of my own?","If the studios paid the artists, how would they ever be able to afford the executives?","You look just like you!","I will jump on anybody's private plane at the drop of a hat. I'm an old-fashioned lower-middle-class boy.","The Minister of Transport issued this appeal to motorists: Can anyone give him a lift to Leicester?","Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will make me go in a corner and cry by myself for hours.","I think the special thing about Python is that it's a writers' commune. The writers are in charge. The writers decide what the material is.","I love being an older comic now. It's like being an old soccer or an old baseball player. You're in the Hall of Fame and it's nice, but you're no longer that person in the limelight on the spot doing that thing.","I love my family, my wife, my kids, my dogs, my home, my life. I am a very happy and contented man.","I listen to the audience and try and bounce with them. All audiences are different. But they are all homo sapiens.","I like being a foreigner. For me, to live in California is very pleasant - I'm more comfortable not feeling a part of everything, not feeling responsible for the government or the roads or the health system.","It's such fun to take a lot of people and create something silly.","The dreadful thing about getting older is you cry at the drop of a hat.","I love stage work. The thing about plays is that they're perfectible. With film, you shoot that take and maybe another. During 'Spamalot,' I rewrote Act II three times.","I never think in terms of target audience. I try to write what makes me laugh, so I'm the target audience. I guess I just hope there's another person in America like me.","I'm drawn to things that aren't particularly popular at the time. I don't know why.","It just seems to me that there's no particular reason comedy albums should be dead. There's a lot to laugh at. We have very funny people, still.","Probably spending 12 years at boarding school - comedy became a survival gene. But I think some people are funny right off the bat, as soon as they can speak or be naughty.","I've always found bad films more enjoyable than good ones.","I was thrilled to win a Tony in 2005 for 'Spamalot'."],"Eric Jerome Dickey":["It's impossible to explain creativity. It's like asking a bird, 'How do you fly?' You just do.","I'm just trying to write a good story, strictly from imagination. People just think it's random, they don't see the rewriting, phrasing of characters, choosing the words, bringing the world to light in which the characters live in. That creates an illusion that this is real.","When you start a new job or a particular journey, you really don't know what to expect. I mean, you hear about your name being on the bestsellers list, but it doesn't really mean anything. Like, really, what does that translate to?","For a lot of people, becoming an author is a change in occupation... they are coming from something that totally has nothing to do with this. If they are expecting to come into a room full of people praising them, then they are in the wrong place.","Some people are just so happy to get published to, they sign anything. Next thing you know, they've signed over the rights to their book.","I want those young whipper-snappers to know that in days past we actually used to kill trees and make those things called books.","As a writer, I challenge myself not to tell the same story - to tackle different characters with different issues."],"Eric Johnson":["You can't just blame things on evil. Everyone's a human, so when people say that somebody's behaving 'inhuman,' it's not. It's very human - it's just not a very nice side of it.","The great thing about being a lead is getting to go to work every day and have fun.","Growing up in Canada, none of my family were performers or anything like that, but I was terrible at hockey, so they needed something for me to do on Saturdays for me to get out of the house. I signed up for theater school on Saturdays, and I'd go for four-and-a-half hours every Saturday morning and learn about theater.","I did my first professional play at 11, and there was really nothing else I ever dreamed of doing. I felt so fortunate that I knew at the age of like, 12, like this is all I want to do for the rest of my life; that's the only play. There's no backup plan. My mom wanted me to go to school and have a backup plan. I'm like 'No, this is the only plan.'","The best thing about doing those Hallmark movies is my dad loves them. My dad watches all of those Christmas movies, not just ones I'm in. He watches them all, so the first one I did, it was like my Christmas present to my dad.","Movies are a big thing in our house. Every Friday, we do family pizza night, and we make pizza from scratch, and then we sit down and watch a movie.","I had a friend who had done the cinematics for 'Splinter Cell: Conviction,' so he kind of indoctrinated me into the series. I did a bunch of temp stuff for him - I roughed stuff in the game for him, playing about nine characters - just so he had some character templates to work from.","When a lot of people watch these Victorian-era shows, they're in love with the costumes, the romance, the whole sweep of it all. But there is nothing nostalgic about 'The Knick' at all.","Actors are almost conditioned to get their director's approval. 'I just did my song and dance, boss. What did you think?' Actors are infantilized so much.","I realize I live in a bubble, and all the opportunities are there to me. And having done a number of popular TV series, I'm mildly famous in certain situations, and lots of doors open to me.","At the end of the day, you're saying lines and playing pretend. All that varies from show to show is the level of the intensity and the terms of the expectations you place on yourself.","You dream about getting to be a part of really solid projects.","One of things that drives me nuts is you rarely get bad guys who are written very well.","I'm resigned to the fact that I'm gonna be the person in shows that people hate and dislike and root against. And I'm OK with it.","Sometimes it's tough as a supporting character: you are on the sidelines, and you don't get to be there for most of the fun stuff. You are hearing about all the great stuff that is going on, but you never get to be a part of it.","It's pretty amazing to see something in your head and write it down, go out and shoot it, then see it on the big screen. It's a pretty amazing feeling.","It doesn't feel good to be a horrible, violent, misogynist person.","I have played my fair share of bad guys, or at least the nemesis.","I've played horrible people and done horrible things, and there were moments on 'The Knick' where it was super uncomfortable - some of the things I had to do and say.","As a performer, I'm happy if one person gets to see the work I do, but to have lots of people see it and appreciate it, it feels good."],"Eric Johnston":["The dinosaur's eloquent lesson is that if some bigness is good, an overabundance of bigness is not necessarily better.","If the power goes out, business stops... whether you sell roses or you're a big manufacturer.","Movies are immortal art - the first new art since Greek drama.","Most government officials are rushing headlong to solve the problems of 50 years ago, with their ears assailed by the sound of snails whizzing by."],"Eric Kandel":["One of the ultimate challenges for biology is to understand the brain's processing of unconscious and conscious perception, emotion, and empathy.","Memory has always fascinated me. Think of it. You can recall at will your first day in high school, your first date, your first love.","I had many moments of disappointment, despondency, and exhaustion, but I always found that by reading the literature and showing up at my lab looking at the data as they emerged day by day and discussing them with my students and postdoctoral fellows, I would gain a notion of what to do next.","Modernism in Vienna brought together science and culture in a new way to create an Age of Insight that emphasized a more complex view of the human mind than had ever existed before.","Life is sort of a circle. You come back to a lot of the interests that you had early in life.","In art, as in science, reductionism does not trivialize our perception - of color, light, and perspective - but allows us to see each of these components in a new way.","The brain is a complex biological organ possessing immense computational capability: it constructs our sensory experience, regulates our thoughts and emotions, and controls our actions.","Nerve cells communicate with one another at specialized points called synapses. And these synapses are plastic - they can be modified by learning.","The biology of mind bridges the sciences - concerned with the natural world - and the humanities - concerned with the meaning of human experience.","In order to produce learned fear, you take a neutral stimulus like a tone, and you pair it with an electrical shock. Tone, shock. Tone, shock. So the animal learns that the tone is bad news. But you can also do the opposite - shock it at other times, but never when the tone comes on.","My parents were not born in Vienna, but they had spent much of their lives there, having each come to the city at the beginning of World War I when they were still very young.","If you read any of my books, they tend to have a strong historical perspective.","Since Socrates and Plato first speculated on the nature of the human mind, serious thinkers through the ages - from Aristotle to Descartes, from Aeschylus to Strindberg and Ingmar Bergman - have thought it wise to understand oneself and one's behavior.","Psychoanalysis has a degree of unreliability about it. You will never know whether you've found the truth. You may find a subjective truth, but you don't know.","You learn emotional experiences as much as you learn cognitive experiences, except that they are more unconscious. Sometimes one represses the cognitive component of it, but it's often more difficult to repress the emotional component.","It may act as an ancillary factor, but by itself, the mutation in tau doesn't give you Alzheimer's disease. This is not to say the tau is not very important. It may be important in propagating the disorder from one cell to another. But as a causal mechanism, the evidence is strongest for beta amyloid abnormalities.","There was little in my early life to indicate that an interest in biology would become the passion of my academic career. In fact, there was little to suggest I would have an academic career.","I was born in Vienna on November 7, 1929, eleven years after the multiethnic Austro-Hungarian Empire fell apart following its defeat in World War I.","My parents genuinely loved Vienna, and in later years I learned from them why the city exerted a powerful hold on them and other Jews. My parents loved the dialect of Vienna, its cultural sophistication, and artistic values.","In the 1950s and early 1960s, psychoanalysis swept through the intellectual community, and it was the dominant mode of thinking about the mind. People felt that this was a completely new set of insights into human motivation, and that its therapeutic potential was significant.","The problem of psychoanalysis is not the body of theory that Freud left behind, but the fact that it never became a medical science. It never tried to test its ideas.","Long-term memory involves enduring changes that result from the growth of new synaptic connections.","You could double the number of synaptic connections in a very simple neurocircuit as a result of experience and learning. The reason for that was that long-term memory alters the expression of genes in nerve cells, which is the cause of the growth of new synaptic connections.","I was interested in the nature of human mental processes, which is what got me interested in psychoanalysis. And it became clear to me after a while that mental processes come from the brain, and in order to understand them, you need to be a biologist of the brain.","I have a philosophy that has guided me throughout all of my scientific career, and that is, I think of myself as a fairly thoughtful person. I don't go into projects impetuously, and I try to select important problems.","I like problems at the borders of disciplines. One of the reasons that neurobiology of learning and memory appeal to me so much was that I liked the idea of bringing biology and psychology together.","I was reluctant to be critical of the United States because I thought the United States could do no wrong; that the government could not lie to its people.","Early in my career, I was disappointed that psychoanalysis was not becoming more empirical, was not becoming more scientific. It was primarily concerned with individual patients. It wasn't trying to collect data from large groups of people who have been analyzed.","What the Ellison Foundation and I are hoping to encourage is a more holistic approach to psychiatry, in which psychotherapy is put on as rigorous a level as psychopharmacology.","Rather than studying the most complex form of memory in a very complicated animal, we had to take the most simple form - an implicit form of memory - in a very simple animal. So I began to look around for very simple animals. And I focused in on the marine snail Aplysia.","I went to medical school after having decided to do so somewhere between my junior and senior year at Harvard - very late. I initially wanted to be an intellectual historian.","I found working in the lab is so completely different than reading a textbook about it. You know, you're planning strategies; you're working with your own hands. There's essential satisfaction in running experiments.","A brain scan may reveal the neural signs of anxiety, but a Kokoschka painting, or a Schiele self-portrait, reveals what an anxiety state really feels like. Both perspectives are necessary if we are to fully grasp the nature of the mind, yet they are rarely brought together.","One of the ultimate challenges of biology is to understand how the brain becomes consciously aware of perception, experience and emotion. But it is equally conceivable that the exchange would be useful for the beholders of art, for people who enjoy art, for historians, and for the artists themselves.","I would not necessarily say that scientists and artists need to collaborate with one another, but it would be helpful for them to talk to one another to, perhaps, give rise to specific ideas that may or may not be carried out together.","I've been collecting art for much of my adult life. I started around 1960. And my wife and I really enjoy art a great deal. We don't have a lot of money, so we have works on paper, but we enjoy them a great deal.","As you know, in most areas of science, there are long periods of beginning before we really make progress.","One can, in principle, outline sort of a set of neural circuits that are critically involved and even identify disorders that affect different components of that neural circuit and see what happens if you knock out, for example, inability to recognize faces, how it affects your response to portraiture.","One of the wonderful things about Internet is it's like a salon. It brings people together from different intellectual walks of life.","Indeed, artists, particularly modern artists, have intentionally limited the scope and vocabulary of their expression to convey, as Mark Rothko and Ad Reinhardt do, the most essential, even spiritual, ideas of their art.","Ever since the Enlightenment, people thought that we were living in a rational universe. They thought that God was a mathematician and that the function of the scientist was to figure out the mathematical rules whereby the universe was created.","Carl von Rokitansky is one of the founders of scientific medicine and systematized it, looking at what the clinical symptoms mean. The medicine we practice today, which is infinitely more sophisticated, is Rokitansky's medicine.","My heart beats in three-quarter time.","When I was a medical student in the 1950s, we practically never spoke about Alzheimer's disease. And why is that so? And that is because people didn't live long enough to have Alzheimer's disease.","I've been around a long time, and I've been interested in memory for a long time. And one of my earlier interests in molecular biology of memory led me to define the switch that converts short term to long term memory.","If you have a lesion in the hippocampus in both sides, you have short term memory, but you can convert that short term memory into long term memory.","The problem for many people is that we cannot point to the underlying biological bases of most psychiatric disorders. In fact, we are nowhere near understanding them as well as we understand disorders of the liver or the heart."],"Eric Kripke":["It's hard asking someone with a broken heart to fall in love again.","People simply don't make eye contact anymore.","When you start a show, the plans are not set in stone. They're really mutable, cocktail napkin sketches.","Beyond all our Blackberries and iPhones, we're dangerously separated from our food and water supplies.","Religion and gods and beliefs - for me, it all comes down to your brother. And your brother might be the brother in your family, or it might be the guy next to you in the foxhole - it's about human connections.","People love a good mystery; I understand that.","If I had a worldview, and I don't know if I do, but if I did, it's one that's intensely humanistic.","I've had a lifelong obsession with urban legends and American folklore.","I'm not a fan of endless mystery in storytelling - I like to know where the mythology's going; I like to get there in an exciting, fast-paced way - enough that there's a really clear, aggressive direction to where it's going, to pay off mystery and reward the audiences loyalty.","I like to tell stories that have beginnings, middles and ends.","Every so often, you want to map out your plot mythology but never so specifically that you can't let a story surprise you. You want to allow the type of action of the writer's room so that you have the ability to take a left turn.","People pitch me the crazy mystery mind-blowing thing all the time. My response is, 'Great, but how do the characters feel about it, and how do we reveal new facets and new dimensions of who they are?'","Mythologies become exhausting burdens, from a writer's perspective.","Television showrunners are a foolishly optimistic bunch."],"Eric Ladin":["My friend Jonathan had a great tree house. It was awesome. It was like a big fort up in this tall magnolia tree... That's where we would conduct our very important business, I'm sure, with all our bikes leaning up against a tree and no girls allowed, handling all sorts of important things you handle when you're seven or eight.","I'm new to the Twitterverse and so I'm attempting to build my followers. I'm trying to be a better tweeter. I try not to tweet too much, just when I've got something worthwhile to say.","I guess working on 'Mad Men' turned me onto AMC and really got me watching the network, and so with that I got a good idea of the type of show they like to produce.","It's funny: All my friends back home are always wondering why every television show I'm on is a drama, but all the comedy pilots I did died a slow and painful death.","Honestly, I was a good kid but I figured out pretty early that I had a gift for making people laugh. I wanted to entertain and when that happens you tend to get yourself in trouble in class.","I feel challenged every day, when I come to work. I feel like I have to step up my game, and that's a great thing.","To be able to work with actors who are doing such good work, not only makes it easier for you, but it makes you better.","I've been extremely lucky to be a part of these really great shows that have gotten so much attention."],"Eric Lefkofsky":["To me, no one has fully cracked the code on social recruiting yet.","I've been part of founding three companies that have gone public. It doesn't seem like a big number, but it's actually a lot.","My weeks tend to differ pretty dramatically.","I think there are four or five interesting pockets where a lot of cool technology companies are getting started. Chicago is one of them. New York is certainly another. Silicon Valley really dominates. And you're seeing some stuff out of Boston and Seattle and down South.","The West coast money and the East coast money, in an ever-increasing manner, is finding its way to Chicago.","Think about the way most companies currently hire. You post a job and then get blind resumes in response. This should be a social experience.","Studying doesn't have to happen in a silo. It can be a social experience. You can engage with your friends and family to find out the answer to a tough question or have someone explain it to you. You can also study anywhere you happen to be and on any device.","Any business that is looking for new customers needs to understand the Internet and how to market their goods or services through it.","The big success stories - Facebook, Zynga and Twitter - are leading to investing in ideas on a napkin, because no one wants to miss out on the next big thing.","I'm going to be in technology for a long time.","I'm going to start a lot of companies. These are not sham companies. These are great businesses."],"Eric Lewis":["People are used to seeing kids jump around. You know, the target audience, the audience that's spending money on music, like rock and hip-hop - they're used to seeing people get really physically involved in their music.","I'm endorsed by Yamaha. I represent Yamaha, and I really like the way that piano handles and capacitates the force that I put into it without losing the shape of the sound and the contour, and it really holds up well.","The iPod has taken away the whole platinum record sales prospect. Sincerity and specificity are going to be the hot commodities in music. Everybody can have anything that they want, so now it gets into what specifically you have to give.","Labels serve a purpose. They help one be identified. And I want to be identified.","I've never broken a piano. However, I've been banned from particular clubs for breaking piano strings."],"Eric Liddell":["God made me fast. And when I run, I feel His pleasure."],"Eric Lindros":["I've been excited since I received a phone call from Paul Holmgren inviting me to represent the Flyers and Flyer fans at the alumni game of the Winter Classic weekend.","I look forward to proving something to myself and others.","Right now I'm happy to be on the ice anywhere, anytime.","It's not necessarily the amount of time you spend at practice that counts; it's what you put into the practice.","You have to dream dreams to live dreams.","There's always risk. But I'm going to come in and play hard. I want to come in and contribute.","People on the streets are ready for hockey.","I don't think you can run around and crash and bang quite the way that I might have done in the past.","I had great representatives looking out for my best interests and safety. They just happened to be my parents."],"Eric Liu":["In the end, arguing about affirmative action in selective colleges is like arguing about the size of a spigot while ignoring the pool and the pipeline that feed it. Slots at Duke and Princeton and Cal are finite.","It turns out umpires and judges are not robots or traffic cameras, inertly monitoring deviations from a fixed zone of the permissible. They are humans.","Like the 'little emperors' of one-child China, too many Boomers were taught early that the world was made (or saved) for their comfort and enjoyment. They behaved accordingly, with a self-indulgence that was wholly rational, given their situation.","We tend to think of politics as bad, full of dirty tricks, negative ads, big campaigns, but I am here to explore the original meaning of politics, which is positive and has to do with balancing competing interests and looking for solutions.","Americans need to call on Boomers, in their next act onstage, to behave like grown-ups. And there is no better way for them to do this than to guide young people to lives of greater meaning, effectiveness, and purpose.","The summer of 1991, I took $2,000 of my savings and a desktop program, and I asked my friends to write 800 words about something they cared about. I got eight or nine articles and put them together. It was no frills, black and white, no graphics. I printed them out and just dumped piles around D.C.","I know many people on the left are suspicious of words like Americanization. To them, it can sound like a cover for white privilege and warmongering. It suggests arrogance and groupthink. But these connotations are not fixed. It is in our power to reshape them by recalling the best of America.","Jeremy Lin is the only Asian American in the NBA today and one of the few in any professional U.S. sport. His arrival is surely leading other talented Asian American athletes this week to contemplate a pro career.","The Boomers have modeled a set of bad habits, and one grand gesture is not going to unwind all those bad habits.","America is exceptional: but because it yields the likes of Obama, not the likes of Bush.","Talk of citizenship today is often thin and tinny. The word has a faintly old-fashioned feel to it when used in everyday conversation. When evoked in national politics, it's usually accompanied by the shrill whine of a descending culture-war mortar.","What we should celebrate more than diversity is what we do with it. How do we bring everyone in the tent and create something together? In a twenty-first century way that activates our true potential, we all need to become sworn-again.","We live in a great country. It's time again to get religion about it.","When Bryan Price taught me how to throw a changeup, he made me see myself. All my life, I've been the equivalent of a fastball pitcher - trying to use blazing speed and brute force to wow the people around me.","Throughout this country's history there have of course been systematic efforts to create an official underclass.","In the end no segregationist scheme has withstood the force of a simple idea: equality under law.","If the undocumented have to work hard to attain citizenship, those of us who already are citizens should have to work hard to sustain it. We should all have to serve more, vote more, build more, and do more for our country.","You want to defend citizenship? Don't persecute or isolate those without papers. Just live like a citizen. That'd be a first-class way to be American.","Have you ever watched someone become American? Last week, at a national citizenship conference I organize, thirty immigrants from 17 countries swore an oath and became citizens of the United States. It was a stirring experience for the hundreds of people in the room.","From the right, you get demagogues shouting about brown-skinned anchor babies and clamoring to deport the undocumented. From the left, you get advocacy for the oppressed but otherwise, when it comes to national civic identity, mainly silence.","Conservatives forget that citizenship is more than a thing to withhold from immigrants. Progressives forget it's more than a set of rights.","In the end, a new Americanization movement can't just be about listing our privileges and immunities, which we catalog in our laws. It also has to be about reinforcing our duties, which we convey in our habits.","We all want merit to mean something, and we all may be tempted to reduce that meaning to something measurable and concrete like an SAT score. The reality, though, is that who deserves entry into an institution depends on what the institution exists to do.","Great numbers of Asian Americans do not fit the model minority or 'tiger family' stereotypes, living instead in multigenerational poverty far from the mainstream.","Imagine filling a college with the first 1,000 students to get perfect SATs. Whatever the racial composition of that class would be, the notion seems absurd because we know that college in America is supposed to be about creating citizens and leaders in a diverse nation.","Six decades ago, as Mao's Communists seized power, the question in Washington was, 'Who lost China?' Now, as his capitalist descendants stand astride the world stage and Washington worries about decline, it seems to be, 'Who lost America?'","To be sure, the United States has profound problems, not least our faltering educational and physical infrastructure.","Much of our national debate proceeds as if China and America were locked in a zero-sum game in which one's loss is precisely the other's gain.","Why does an iPhone cost only a couple hundred dollars? Because, as the stage performer Mike Daisey depicted in an arresting one-man show called 'The Agony and Ecstasy of Steve Jobs,' Apple's shiniest products are made by a shadowy company in China called Foxconn.","After watching my first World Series in 1977, I wanted to be Reggie Jackson. I bought a big Reggie poster. I ate Reggie candy bars. I entered a phase during which I insisted on having the same style of glasses Reggie had: gold wire frames with the double bar across.","There have been, in recent years, many Asian American pioneers in the public eye who've defied the condescendingly complimentary 'model minority' stereotype: actors like Lucy Liu, artists like Maya Lin, moguls like Zappos CEO Tony Hsieh. They are known, often admired.","Identity in America is complicated but it's also simple: it's about whom you identify with and who identifies with you.","The nativism behind the push to repeal or amend the Fourteenth is ugly and obvious.","Here's a proposal, offered only partly in jest: no resident of the United States, whether born here or abroad, should get to be a citizen until age 18, at which time each such resident has to take a test.","Republicans say they want citizenship to truly mean something. Let's be equal-opportunity about it and test everyone, including those very Republicans and others whose forbears came here generations ago.","True fans of the Constitution, like true fans of the national pastime, acknowledge the critical role of human judgment in making tough calls. We don't expect flawless interpretation. We expect good faith. We demand honesty.","Sometimes when I listen to fellow progressives, I wonder if the only lesson we took away from the '04 elections is that politics is a word game.","Many smart folks seem to think that if you just get your metaphors and messages right, you'll win. That if you start describing what you favor as a 'moral value' - 'affordable health care is a moral value' etc., - then you'll appeal to red-state voters.","'The Purpose-Driven Life' is not just a mega-bestselling work of Christian faith; it is the thing that every voter, secular or not, yearns for.","You cannot mistake Bush's clarity of purpose. He believes in a story about freedom and opportunity that makes his followers feel like they aren't just ticking their days down but are part of something larger than themselves.","Why should citizenship be a matter of birth? The premise held by those who want to end birthright citizenship is that some people deserve it and some do not - that the status shouldn't be handed out automatically. Frankly, that's a premise worth considering.","As it stands now, those of us who are lucky enough to be citizens by birth don't have to do much. Very little is asked of us.","Today, public understanding of our past and our system of government is pitifully low.","The next time someone uses denial of citizenship as a weapon or brandishes the special status conferred upon him by the accident of birth, ask him this: What have you done lately to earn it?","The Boomers will eventually have to accept that it is not possible to stay forever young or to stop aging. But it is possible, by committing to show up for others in community after community, to earn a measure of immortality.","Race in America has always centered on our mutual agreement not to see each other. White or non-white. Black or non-black. Mongoloid, Hindoo. We've always bought into to the crudest, humanity-denying forms of sorting.","If whiteness were of no particular advantage, then having a fuller color wheel of skin tones would be purely a matter of celebration. But whiteness - just a drop of it - does still carry privilege. You learn that very young in America.","If half-black Barack Obama had decided years ago to call himself white - which his genes certainly entitled him to do - his story would have carried very different meaning. If millions of part-black people had followed him into whiteness, then the N.A.A.C.P. would be in true crisis.","My grandfather was a general in the Nationalist Chinese Air Force during World War II, and I grew up hearing the pilot stories and seeing pictures of him in uniform.","I had heard so much negative talk about our generation, that we're slackers and young fogies, that I knew wasn't true of the people I know.","Today's multiracial Americans are at greater liberty to choose how they'd like to be seen, and under less pressure to pass for white."],"Eric Ludy":["The Word of God is a treasure map. That treasure map is the most valuable thing you have until you get to that treasure.","The emergent movement is creating a mushiness to the thinking patterns in Christianity today. It's like we really can't stand for anything.","I actually do propose open-mindedness, but open-mindedness to the Word of God.","Job 29 is about Job reflecting on his past before the calamity hit him to say this is the type of man I was. So, you want to know what God calls perfect and upright? Read Job 29, and you will understand what kind of man God esteems.","My problem with the Emergent Church is not the questions they are bringing up, but the answers they are giving. They are making Christianity milky. They are making it so you can no longer define anything. There is no sound judgment allowed.","Whether we want to acknowledge it or not, Jesus didn't do it the world's way. He came in and offended the world. He came in and did everything the wrong way."],"Eric Mabius":["You do have to follow your heart, otherwise you're living a false life.","When I watch films or tv that I've done, I get very restless and tend to not sit still.","A lot of actors are perfectionists, besides merely being egotists.","Overall, women are a lot more fun to work with than a bunch of men.","I can tell women's confidence levels rise when they wear heels.","Being able to laugh at a situation can help you hang on to your perspective. And there's an intimacy in laughter that nothing else can come close to.","If a woman is bed-heady and it doesn't look put on, it's pretty sexy. But when a woman is wearing a really smart dress with great heels and her hair is pulled back, that's terribly sexy too - like an Audrey Hepburn kind of thing.","I didn't date my wife in high school, but she was definitely by far the coolest woman there. She was definitely the most beautiful, but she also marched to the beat of her own drummer. I was in New Orleans 10 years after high school and my friend played matchmaker with us, and that's kind of how we got together.","I think that when you've only lived 17 years, you don't have, you haven't had a full canon of experiences, so every moment that you have here feels like the last moment in the world, because you've only had a handful of whatever those moments are."],"Eric Maskin":["A properly designed tax system can strike a balance between helping the poor and, at the same time, giving people the incentive to work.","There is universal consensus among experts that the earth's atmosphere is heating up - and that we are responsible for it by putting carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. We also know that the consequences of global warming are catastrophic. But how do we make sure that all countries reduce greenhouse gases?","It wasn't that Harvard was deliberately trying to overwork me, but I think I had a tendency to take on more things out of enthusiasm than were good for me.","I like to work on a number of things simultaneously. If you're working on a variety of projects and if you get stuck on one of them, you can move to another without grinding your gears indefinitely.","I think I have met nearly all the Laureates in Economics. Among the few I haven't met, I suppose I'd most like to meet Ronald Coase because of his legendary power to persuade his colleagues of the validity of the Coase Theorem.","Prediction is certainly a valuable goal in science, but not the only one. Explanation is also important, and there are plenty of sciences that do a lot of explaining and not much predicting.","What we mean by an outcome will naturally depend on the context. Thus, for a government charged with delivering public goods, an outcome will consist of the quantities provided of such goods as intercity highways, national defense and security, environmental protection, and public education together with the arrangements by which they are financed.","I was born in New York City but grew up across the Hudson River in Alpine, New Jersey.","At Tenafly High, I was lucky to have some dedicated teachers; I'm especially indebted to my calculus instructor, Francis Piersa, who opened my eyes to the striking beauty of mathematics.","I probably learned most at MIT by teaching and working with Peter Diamond, who acted like a big brother to me during my time in the department.","Of course, MIT was notable not just for its faculty but also for its students. And, facing such extremely bright kids as a rookie teacher was something like being thrown to the wolves.","Much theoretical work, of course, focuses on existing economic institutions. The theorist wants to explain or forecast the economic or social outcomes that these institutions generate.","The theory of mechanism design can be thought of as the 'engineering' side of economic theory.","Because mechanism designers do not generally know which outcomes are optimal in advance, they have to proceed more indirectly than simply prescribing outcomes by fiat; in particular, the mechanisms designed must generate the information needed as they are executed.","Economic forecasting has actually got pretty good over the years, though admittedly, we don't always get it right.","If budget planning requires gathering information from people who may not always have the incentive to disclose that information, then the principles of mechanism design can definitely be of use in such planning.","I entered economics because of a course I took on 'information economics,' which I found fascinating.","I choose questions to work on according to how much they excite me.","In various countries around the world, assets that had previously been in the hands of governments were sold off to the private sector in the hope that this would lead to a more efficient allocation, that these assets would be put to better use.","Through meteorology, we know essentially how hurricanes form, even though we can't say where the next storm will arise.","Perhaps one day earthquakes, hurricanes and financial crashes will all be predictable. But we don't have to wait until then for seismology, meteorology and economics to become sciences; they already are.","There are some things that we value as a public good that the markets can't deliver, like clean air.","The market is no god - it cannot solve every problem.","Most policy makers embrace a religious-like belief that the market can and should solve every problem.","I have a strong attachment to Harvard.","I'm not a housing market expert, and I don't want to pretend to be one.","If I'm a bank, and I'm making risky loans, I have an incentive, if I can, to make those loans using other people's money: in other words, to make highly leveraged loans.","I don't want to make public statements about issues that I have not studied in detail.","Many markets work best with little or no outside interference. But others - especially those subject to big 'externalities' - need a helping hand.","When a bank calls in a loan, it obviously hurts the customer in question. But it also adversely affects other banks that have lent to this borrower. They are now less likely to be repaid and so can't as readily lend to their own customers.","If banks anticipate government will come to the rescue should the credit market go badly awry, they may make loans that would otherwise be imprudent, e.g. subprime loans with little prospect of repayment.","A contingent bailout policy - implicit or explicit - must be coupled with some regulation of what banks can and cannot do. For example, a ban on lending to uncreditworthy customers might well make sense.","Specifically, in the software industry, progress is highly sequential: progress is typically made through a large number of small steps, each building on the previous ones.","In an industry with highly sequential innovation, it may be better for society to scrap patents altogether than try to tighten them.","The market doesn't work very well when it comes to public goods.","Markets work well with goods that economists call private goods.","If I buy a car, I use the car, you don't, and the market for cars works pretty well. But there are many other sorts of goods, often very important goods, which are not provided well through the market. Often, these go under the heading of public goods.","How do we ensure in the case of public goods that they are provided at all, and that they are provided at the right level, taking into account citizens' preferences?","The Nobel Prize is not very important for the winners - they are usually pretty successful people already. But it is valuable as a way of drawing the public's attention to important work in economics.","Devising a mechanism is a lot like solving a puzzle - and gives you the same kind of kick.","Leo Hurwicz is the father of mechanism design theory and has inspired much of my work, and Roger Myerson is an old friend and collaborator and a tremendous economist.","This may not be the most serious problem in the world, but it is a familiar one: How do you divide a piece of cake equally between two children and also make sure that each of them sees it as a fair division?"],"Eric Massa":["Here's a news flash: No soldier gives his life. That's not the way it works. Most soldiers who make a conscious decision to place themselves in harm's way do it to protect their buddies. They do it because of the bonds of friendship - and it goes so much deeper than friendship.","That's a tumor. It goes across my liver, up through my lungs, all the way around my heart. And when they were done trying to cut it out, nuke it out with radiation and chemotherapy it out, it left so much scar tissue that when I walk outside now in cold weather and take a deep breath, it feels like someone is stabbing me.","I do believe in God. That's why I'm alive.","If what I've been told is true - and I believe it is, General David Petraeus, a commander with soldiers deployed in two theaters of war, has had multiple meetings with Dick Cheney, the former vice-president of the United States, to discuss Petraeus's candidacy for the Republican nomination for the presidency.","You think that somehow they didn't come after me to get rid of me because my vote is the deciding vote in the health care bill? Then, ladies and gentlemen, you live today in a world that is so innocent as to not understand what's going on in Washington, D.C.","Rahm Emanuel is son of the devil's spawn. He is an individual who would sell his mother to get a vote. He would strap his children to the front end of a steam locomotive.","And this administration and this House leadership have said, quote-unquote, they will stop at nothing to pass this health care bill. And now they've gotten rid of me and it will pass. You connect the dots.","I should have never allowed myself to be as familiar with my staff as I was.","I never translated from my days in the Navy to being a congressman.","I happen to believe that health care is an imminent crisis. It is.","I will vote adamantly against the interests of my district if I actually think what I am doing is going to be helpful.","I am leaving because I have to fight simultaneously a potential recurrence of cancer the Democratic leadership, a health care bill that's going to destroy this country, my opposition to it and a belief that my party has become what it became - what it campaigned against.","I'm collateral damage. I'm road kill. And in 72 hours, nobody is going to remember who I am nor are they going to care.","My very good friend, Rahm Emanuel, made it very clear to me on several occasions that I was, quote, unquote, not a team player; that I was not - that I didn't not have a future.","In health care, the biggest imperative is: Fix those who cannot get insurance without changing the world for everyone else.","Congressmen spend between five and seven hours a day on the phone, begging for money.","When I voted against the cap-and-trade bill, the phone rang and it was the chief of staff of the president of the United States of America, Rahm Emanuel, and he started swearing at me in terms and words that I hadn't heard since that crossing the line ceremony on the USS New Jersey in 1983.","Look, half the men who signed the Declaration of Independence were either in debt or bankrupt. The remaining half, most of them lost all their possessions. The only reason Monticello didn't get burned to the ground was that the British patrol missed the road."],"Eric McCormack":["Most people, if you live in a big city, you see some form of schizophrenia every day, and it's always in the form of someone homeless. 'Look at that guy - he's crazy. He looks dangerous.' Well, he's on the streets because of mental illness. He probably had a job and a home.","I could probably eat sushi every day.","Each one of us fulfills a piece of a larger puzzle.","It's hard in this business to get the opportunities to show off range.","On Netflix and other streaming services, they're taking risks that are based on 'Come with us! Come with us!' and the audience does.","I knew I wanted to be an actor in first grade.","Unfortunately, with men's health, we don't talk about it enough, and prostate cancer gets lost in the conversation.","When you become a father, everything changes.","I think I was very lucky that I didn't get well-known until my early thirties. If it had happened when I was younger, you might have seen me falling out of nightclubs. I think I conducted myself as a much better human being because I was already married when all that came along (I got married five months after I got the role as Will).","I'm torn about late parenting. I believe people should spend their twenties living and having fun and not having any regrets later. I also think people in their thirties generally make better parents but so many of my friends are having trouble - myself included - as fathers get older.","That's an amazing feeling, to walk onstage, and you're not thinking about anything, you're not thinking about your lines or what you're supposed to do - your body, your brain knows, so there's freedom. There's not fear, there's not nerves.","As a television actor, there's a power you're given to use your image to do something valuable. As a parent, these messages are particularly important to me.","I did 'The Commish' and an episode of 'Neon Rider,' and then I got the series called 'Street Justice,' which I ended up doing about 18 episodes of.","We see people talking to themselves all the time. We always have. Particularly if they're homeless people or at all questionable, there's a sense of, 'That guy's crazy!' I see that now with a much more empathetic eye.","Particularly in television, we can stereotype ourselves. You realize that we all have a lot of voices in our head. We have angry voices, we have voices of doubt, and we have moments of strength.","This 'historical record' will exist, flawed as it is, in hundreds of years. What will that tell the future? How accurate are we reporting our lives?","Mental illness is the last frontier. The gay thing is part of everyday life now on a show like 'Modern Family,' but mental illness is still full of stigma. Maybe it is time for that to change.","I started to realise that it wasn't for me. Perhaps I didn't have to give my Hamlet before I died, that the world might be an OK place without my Hamlet, in fact.","Will isn't a screaming queen - that's Jack's part. They needed someone to play the part for America. It's just not the same as Britain. To have a gay character as a lead is risky.","I'm doing a very funny show in which we talk about issues. I speak at Aids charities and things. It's great to do something fun with our days and yet we're told we're doing something important.","I have accomplished a lot, but it didn't happen overnight for me. I was 35 when I got the show, and had been working professionally for 15 years. It would be a lot weirder if I were in my early 20s and stumbled into it.","But I was ready for it and I knew I could do it. I've just turned 40, I have a son and I feel more settled and driven than ever. I think my 40s will be my most prolific time. It's a very rare life you get to lead as a sitcom guy.","At home in L.A., Sunday is lazy. It's the wife and me lying in bed with coffee, watching 'The Soup' or something funny on TiVo. The kid will occasionally join us. Eventually, breakfast is at a place down the street called Paty's. And we always have some kind of great dinner - my wife makes a great roast beef.","My most romantic job: I was a manager at Baskin-Robbins.","I think there's a certain objectivity that comes from being Canadian. You're partly British and partly American; you have a good bird's-eye view of both countries. So much of the comedy that comes out of Canada is impersonation - it's less 'look at me' than it is 'look at me playing other people.'","My wife is a real camper; it's a nice way to bond.","I never felt cool growing up. I was a bit of an outsider, but I discovered theatre very early on, which got me through.","When I read the script for Will & Grace in 1998, I knew I was the only guy for the part.","If you're doing an hour-long show, you're working movie hours, doing a 12-15-hour day. We work three or four hours a day, and get every third or fourth week off to give the writers time to write. It's the cushiest job in Hollywood.","I had played many gay characters before, but they were finite - guest characters in TV shows or characters in plays.","Growing up, my father was a financial analyst for an oil company. He was just a regular dad. And when I would say, 'Hey, come see my play,' he'd say, 'Sure.' He'd see one, 'Oh, good play' - you know, very typical dad reaction.","I was raised on 'Get Smart' and 'All in the Family' and 'M.A.S.H.,' and certainly when 'Cheers' came along, that was a big one.","We didn't, with 'Will & Grace,' set out to change the gay world. We just set out to be funny.","I think we all realize that anyone can - and has - gotten AIDS. So there's obviously still a lot to be done.","I like playing a character every day. I like having something to go back to. I always enjoyed that with 'Will & Grace.' I like the camaraderie. I like having a crew that I know and I can work with every day.","Back when I was in theater school, trying to figure out what I was going to do with my life, 'Sweeney Todd' was a huge touchstone for me, my favorite musical for sure.","I always get a little uppity when I hear the phrase 'TV actor.' It's like saying you're a magazine reporter. I was in the theater for ten years before I ever had a TV audition.","There wasn't an episode of 'Will & Grace' that didn't begin with my voice saying, 'Will & Grace' is taped before a live studio audience.","'Perception' was a different show than 'Will & Grace'. 'Will & Grace' was obviously a different show than anything I'd done before.","Certainly 'Lonesome Dove' would be way hard now, because, I mean, back then I wasn't married. I didn't have kids.","As much as I loved Pacino and De Niro and wanted to be a dramatic actor, I also grew up on sitcoms. I grew up on 'M*A*S*H' and 'All In The Family' and 'Cheers.' And then around this time - this would have been '95, '96 - I was so into 'Friends' and 'Mad About You,' the idea of being on a sitcom became a very real thing that I wanted.","Probably one of the most surreal moments of my career was acting in front of Notre Dame with a mime.","I love everybody at TNT, and they were totally behind 'Trust Me.' I totally loved that show. I feel like it should have had more life.","I know where TNT's sweet spot is, and when I read 'Perception,' I thought, 'This is a chance to play a fascinating, fun, challenging character but still within the realm of something that will sit very well with 'The Closer' and 'Major Crimes' and the other shows there.'","I love playing anyone that does stuff that I don't do.","I love learning language and ideas that I didn't know before and making them sound like my own.","That's the hard part of television: When you walk into the network tests, you're signing away seven years of your life.","That was the only trepidation I had about 'Will & Grace.' It had nothing to do with the sexuality of the character. It was more, 'This could be the next 7 to 10 years of my life.'","I think most actors go into the business thinking, 'I can play everything. Why can't I play a black woman? Just give me a chance.' Then you grow up and realize it's probably better that they cast an actual black woman.","As I got older, I realized that my life experience, what I really had, was always going to be more valuable than what I pretended to have.","The vote is the important thing. Just go and vote.","I've had to take roles that on purpose were not Will-like so that someone like 'The Hollywood Reporter' would write, 'McCormack shows great range; no Will Truman here.'","I'm an actor. I can't afford to have a type. I love to mix it up.","I haven't had a chance to play a quiet leading man in a while.","With these scripts and these writers, so much of it is done for me. Because we don't just throw words around: we make sure the audience understands.","I find that with every script I get, I go, 'Who knew this? This is so cool!'","Not a big sci-fi guy.","We're definitely hoping 'Travelers' attracts more than just solely the sci-fi audience, too. There are so many elements here. I think this will be a show that women like, because there's a lot of unlikely romance in it between people who were in love 300 years from now, but they're in different bodies.","In the future, things will truncate! No, in the age of Twitter, we can't be upset when words become shorter.","The States doesn't think much about Canada, but we're attached. We're like Siamese twins. We can't do things - you can't roll over in the American bed without waking up the Canadians. It matters.","Every day, there's something that makes you go, 'Is this Funny or Die?' That can't be a real headline.","There was a time when history was written by a few people, the winners. Now, history is written by all of us all the time... That's the thing we keep telling our 14-year-olds, you know: anything you do right now, it's not going anywhere.","I needed to start pulling at this other sort of funnier, lighter side. So I auditioned for everything. I auditioned for 'Friends,' even.","I did my first musical in 4th grade as Huck Finn. By 11th grade, I was starring in 'Godspell' and 'Pippin' and pretending to be Che in 'Evita' in my bedroom. Singing has always been a huge part of me.","When I was 16, I'd ping pong between AC/DC and Barry Manilow without any sense of irony.","Show-wise, I love 'Little Shop' and 'Big River', 'Avenue Q,' and 'Spring Awakening'.","If we're karaoke-ing, I'm as likely to do Aerosmith as I am 'Sweeney Todd'.","Tom Cavanagh is fantastic.","I didn't want to do a lawyer. I didn't want to do forensics. I didn't want to work in an ER.","Putting my head on Ruth Buzzi's body - it's upsetting.","The Trevor Project provides crisis-intervention and suicide-prevention services to lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning teens and young adults. It's truly a lifeline to so many young people who just need someone to listen to them.","We want all LGBTQ kids to grow up in a world where they feel safe and equal to their straight peers.","It's very strange - several years ago, I was in the running for the 'Young Frankenstein' musical. Kristin Chenoweth was going to do it, but then she backed out because she got 'Pushing Daisies' on TV, and then, the next day, I went in for my final-final audition, and I saw Megan Mullally standing there.","It's very, very hard to create something that is big these days because you have niche markets - and, you don't necessarily need to be big; the show is specifically created for a small group of people. You know, if it's on the USA network, well, then a small group of people is fine.","I always kind of dreamed locally - I never really ever dream that I would be south of the border; I dreamed about being a theatre star in Toronto, and maybe I'd do Stratford and regional stuff. I always thought it would be a slow growth.","I understudied Colm Feore quite a bit in '85 and '86 - 'Persephone' and 'The Boys from Syracuse,' too - and that was great, great training for me. He was and he is an amazing theatre actor.","My first job was at Baskin-Robbins. I made store manager at 16.","I'm still mad at Josh Charles for dying on 'The Good Wife.'"],"Eric Metaxas":["I have no doubt, if people are really seeking the big questions, it will lead them to the Lord.","All of us, believers and non-believers, desire some kind of fellowship and connection.","If God miraculously created all that is, including you and me, then to say that we need miracles is an understatement. Our only response to that idea should be undying gratitude.","Every country has things to be proud of and to celebrate.","We may have city lights and the glow of touch screens to obscure our view, but God's world is still near at hand, even right here in New York City where I live.","The logical conclusion of relativism is absurdity. Non-sense. A worldview that undermines its own premises.","Miracles are signs, and like all signs, they are never about themselves; they're about whatever they are pointing toward. Miracles point to something beyond themselves. But to what? To God himself. That's the point of miracles - to point us beyond our world to another world.","Each era has the fatal hubris to believe that it has once and for all climbed to the top of the mountain and can see everything as it is, from the highest and most objective vantage point possible.","Whether one believes in miracles or the miraculous has mostly to do with the presuppositions one brings to the subject.","There was a time when 'science' meant the systematic pursuit of knowledge through experimentation and observation. But it's rapidly becoming a synonym for progressive politics and materialist philosophy.","Language is powerful. Words matter.","If America is an idea, which it is - we're not a nation of ethnic groups that say we're Americans because we have American blood; we have the blood of every nation in our veins - and there's something really beautiful about that, but it means that we are an idea and that we all have to buy into this idea.","Created in the awesome image of God, men and women know that life has a meaning beyond 'eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we die.'","Freedom requires virtue. Virtue requires faith. And faith, in turn, requires freedom. You can't have coerced state-sanctioned religion. It has to be utterly free.","America is the only nation in the world based on an idea - freedom and self-government - so if we don't understand that idea and what sacrifices were made to win that freedom and keep it for over two centuries, how can we possibly continue to keep it?","Religious liberty is misunderstood. It simply means that the Founders said that everyone in America should have the freedom to practice and exercise their religion. Not to believe it but to exercise our beliefs - to act on our beliefs. It's not about believing privately in your head, privately in that building, or simply about freedom of worship.","To be labeled a 'science-denier' in 2017 often just means you've upset someone who insists on teaching strict, Darwinian orthodoxy in schools or who advocates particular climate legislation or who supports ethically fraught research on embryos.","I came to the conclusion over time that Trump is not the person I feared he was in the beginning when I was against him.","The truth is many singles deeply desire and pray for marriage.","We all can do our part to address America's anger mismanagement crisis. And for us Christians, it starts with a little more faith, hope, and love.","I guess I'm concerned that vulgarity has now officially entered the mainstream of our culture, and I think people have to respectfully stand up and say, 'No thanks.'","Wilberforce, because of his faith, stood up for African slaves. Bonhoeffer, because of his faith, stood up for Jews. That's Christianity to me.","Six-hundred-page biographies of German theologians aren't known to fly off the shelves.","We're commanded by God to worship God with our mind.","Where did God come from? It's certainly more complicated than trying to figure out where, say, Barry Manilow was born.","It's one thing to be innocent and another thing to be naive or willfully ignorant.","Miracles seem to attest to the presence of a loving and compassionate God, one who wants to help us, who wants to speak to us and encourage us.","Donald Trump's rise is certainly a symptom of our fading virtue and faith, but ironically, he may well be our only hope for finding our way back to bolder expressions of them.","No politician has ever used his faith to a greater result for all of humanity, and that is why, in his day, Wilberforce was a moral hero far more than a political one.","When you have a biblical idea of men's strength, you know that God only gives us anything good to be used for his purposes and mainly to serve others.","Young men, more than anything, need good role models in their lives.","To try to preemptively shut down debate with name-calling is profoundly un-American and will harm this country.","Everyone needs to stop and breathe and look at how redefining marriage will have a hugely chilling effect on religious liberty in America.","I think most people have no idea about what religious freedom means.","Religious liberty is the salt and light that has made us the great nation we are in a whole number of ways.","Many in our increasingly secular culture want to chase Christians out of the public square altogether.","If the main contribution that Christians make to culture is complaining about it, we're doing something wrong.","Christians who enjoy and support art and culture, who make it a priority in their lives, and who reach out to those in the arts instead of reflexively pushing them away, can help bring the culture toward a renewed appreciation of goodness, truth, and beauty. And that is good for everyone.","The familiar can feel good - especially with so much uncertainty when we turn on the news. But it doesn't uplift us, challenge us, or inspire anew as truly original work can.","For at least a decade, Millennials have been stereotyped as lazy, entitled, and stuck on social media. While that may not be entirely fair, they are notoriously liberal, overwhelmingly supporting left-leaning candidates and favoring policies like nationalized healthcare and same-sex 'marriage.'","No one knows what the future holds, except the One Who holds the future!","God designed humans to live in community.","We all have different strengths, different gifts.","There's already a world of evidence that life on Earth is unique and intelligently crafted.","Christians recognize that our planet was uniquely designed and fine-tuned to support life - and that's putting it mildly. Our place in the universe is nothing less than a miracle.","Women are, I think, moved by the idea that self-sacrifice is noble and can be the source of great joy.","Our longing for immortality is good! It was put there on purpose. We were meant - from the moment of our creation - to live forever.","Let me tell you something you already know: reading is critically important - especially for Christian believers. God, after all, reveals Himself to us in the written words of Scripture. Think about it: when we read the Word, we place ourselves in the very presence of God.","A Christian worldview impacts every area of life. Including making your house a home.","Home is - or should be - a place for companionship, for rearing children and having friends and family over for meals while the dog begs for scraps under the table.","The power of forgiveness transcends personal relationships.","Thankfully, forgiveness, and the healing it brings in its wake, has nothing to do with 'deserve.'","Ultrasound is instrumental in the fight against abortion precisely because it allows women to make an informed choice by shedding light in a place which, for most of its history, has been shrouded in secrecy.","It's a fact that if Hillary Clinton is elected, the country's chance to have a Supreme Court that values the Constitution - and the genuine liberty and self-government for which millions have died - is gone. Not for four years, or eight, but forever.","For many of us, this is very painful, pulling the lever for someone many think odious. But please consider this: A vote for Donald Trump is not necessarily a vote for Donald Trump himself. It is a vote for those who will be affected by the results of this election. Not to vote is to vote. God will not hold us guiltless.","Part of my life's thesis is that we live in a culture that has bought into the patently silly idea that there is a divide between the secular world and the faith world.","Largely, the people driving abolition did it because of what they believed from the Bible.","You can't fool children.","In some sense, there is no such thing as writing for children.","The odds against life in the universe are simply astonishing. Yet here we are, not only existing, but talking about existing. What can account for it? Can every one of those many parameters have been perfect by accident? At what point is it fair to admit that science suggests that we cannot be the result of random forces?","Doesn't assuming that an intelligence created these perfect conditions require far less faith than believing that a life-sustaining Earth just happened to beat the inconceivable odds to come into being?","The greatest miracle of all time, without any close seconds, is the universe. It is the miracle of all miracles, one that ineluctably points with the combined brightness of every star to something - or Someone - beyond itself.","When Trump says America first, it doesn't mean cheering for America only. It means if you want to care for your neighbors, you have to make sure that you are yourself, first, healthy.","Here's one thing the media and all of us should learn: Trump is not wrong nearly as much as everybody says he's wrong.","We've always been the most generous nation in the world when it comes to caring for those outside of our borders.","Trump errs on the side of bluster sometimes for effect, but I don't think that the people who voted for him, most of them, would ever be for not caring for immigrants or refugees. People in the church know it's our obligation.","The freedoms we have enjoyed in America - and spread around the world - are incredibly fragile freedoms.","Restricting the religious impulses of Americans is precisely like killing free enterprise with too many regulations.","America is fundamentally exceptional. No one in the history of the world had ever done anything to compare with what the Founders did, creating a fragile mechanism by which men and women could actually govern themselves.","Most people really have no problem with the idea of a creator God. Their question is just what is this God like, how can I know about him, how can I know him.","I thought a book on miracles might be a great idea, but just because it's a great idea doesn't mean I'm supposed to do it. But my editor persisted, and eventually I thought, 'He's right. I should write this book.'","If you accept my thesis that the universe and this earth are the most outrageous miracles by an infinite margin, then you will understand that simply for us to exist requires a miracle.","Miracles are supposed to point us to Him, but we can get to God without miracles. It is God himself we should long for rather than for the miracles that point to him. To get caught up in wanting miracles is a bit like thinking the destination of a road trip is the highway you're supposed to take.","I think that there are deceptive forces out there that will try to lead us away from God, and we really do need to be careful.","The only leader America should ever have is someone who understands that the people are the government.","I'm willing to give Pat Robertson a pass when he says things he shouldn't. That's because for every wacky, regrettable thing he says, he does a hundred thousand non-wacky good things that you'll never hear about on television.","Thinking about the sins of others give us a feeling of moral superiority. But thinking about our own sins is a humbling experience, which is generally much less fun.","The Bible is filled with stories about angels, but many of us have had our view of angels confused by popular misconceptions about them, the principal of which is that angels do not actually exist anymore than fairies do, or wood nymphs or water sprites. But they do exist, and the Bible attests to their existence innumerable times.","I'm the author of several books, including children's books.","I think the fact that I use salty words in my Bonhoeffer book would tip you off that I'm no prude, exactly.","As an undergrad, I was the editor of the Yale humor magazine, and since then, I've published humor in the 'New York Times' and 'Atlantic,' among other places.","Even if you aren't a believer, there are incredible stories in the 'good book' that I guarantee you will keep you glued to the page. The Bible is no less a part of our cultural heritage than Shakespeare is - and by the way, Shakespeare's plays are absolutely loaded with Biblical references.","Being an American is something we need to learn and understand.","Often, we have only focused on what we've done wrong as a nation. Of course we should face our sins and our mistakes. But if we get stuck there and don't focus on where we've come from and how we've overcome those sins and mistakes, we are truly to be pitied.","God gave men and women work to do in the Garden before the Fall.","Work is not optional for those able to do work, and that's most of us. There are to be no shirkers in the Lord's kingdom.","Work allows us to take care of God's creation and bring glory to Him as His stewards.","Sometimes you have to hold your nose and vote for the person who is going to do the least damage or who is maybe going to pull you back from the brink.","Donald Trump is not some great man of virtue, but this much I'll say for him: I think he loves America, and I don't think he wants to line his own pockets.","Perhaps the best thing about biographies is that they enable us to slip the strictures of time and provide a bracing corrective to our tendency to see everything in the dark glass of our own era, with all its blind spots, motes, beams, and distortions.","Men and women are complements to each other, physically and otherwise.","Every single cell in each person's body tells us whether that person is a male or a female. There is no human being in history whose cells have some mixture of the two, nor anyone who has ever been able to change that cellular reality.","You and I must demonstrate love to our gay neighbors, of course, remembering that we are ultimately engaged in spiritual warfare. But we should boldly stand up when our rights as citizens and the demands of our conscience are threatened.","David Frum, every now and again, comes up with something pretty darn brilliant.","For proof that our culture has gone to the dogs, look no further than the bizarrely parental ways many Americans talk about our furry friends.","People everywhere see the True, the Beautiful, and the Good and long to know their source. And, thank God, He has revealed Himself!","As Christians, we sin with anger because we lack faith in God's ability to provide for or protect us.","One of my favorite things about America is our breathtaking collection of national and state parks, many of which boast wonders the Psalmist would envy.","Quite simply, our isolation from nature has become isolation from God's Word. Cocooned in our manmade world of climate-controlled homes, cars, subways, and high-rises, we're finding it easier to live as practical atheists."],"Eric Millegan":["A lot of times I feel I probably would have ended up in a mental hospital if it weren't for the structure that 'Bones' gave me.","Bipolar disorder is a scary disease, but it is manageable. And I feel blessed that I was able to get the right attention and the right medication to deal with my specific illness.","I was hoping that I could say stuff about mental illness that maybe people didn't know. You know, speak up for bipolar disorder and let people know a little bit more about it that they may not have known.","If you know people who are suicidal, or if you know people who are bipolar, depressed, have panic attack disorder, just be there for them. They're going through something that's very, very hard.","If you have a friend or a family member who's bipolar, or has panic attack disorder, or is depressed, read up on it a little bit so you can get to know where they're coming from."],"Eric Morecambe":["I'm playing all the right notes, but not necessarily in the right order.","My neighbour asked if he could use my lawnmower and I told him of course he could, so long as he didn't take it out of my garden.","We had not had time to establish ourselves as a double act before Ernie joined the Merchant Navy. I teamed up with the brother of the late Dave Morris.","Together with script writers Sid Green and Dick Hills, we worked on the comedy ideas for this series."],"Eric Nylund":["Tension is the cornerstone of any good story.","'Ghosts of Onyx' is the end of one chapter in the 'Halo' saga - and hopefully the start of an entirely new one!","I don't look at it as writing a book in a videogame universe. I look at it as writing for 'Halo', which for me, transcends being just a great video game. It's evolving into a whole new mythology.","I know a lot more about the 'Halo' universe than the fans do."],"Eric Ries":["I asked all of our recruiters to give me all resumes of prospective employees with their name, gender, place of origin, and age blacked out. This simple change shocked me, because I found myself interviewing different-looking candidates - even though I was 100% convinced that I was not being biased in my resume selection process.","The biggest start-up successes - from Henry Ford to Bill Gates to Mark Zuckerberg - were pioneered by people from solidly middle-class backgrounds. These founders were not wealthy when they began. They were hungry for success, but knew they had a solid support system to fall back on if they failed.","I would say, as an entrepreneur everything you do - every action you take in product development, in marketing, every conversation you have, everything you do - is an experiment. If you can conceptualize your work not as building features, not as launching campaigns, but as running experiments, you can get radically more done with less effort.","You get a culture of entrepreneurship after you have successfully changed the accountability system so that people can use a better process. Process drives culture, not the other way around, so you can't just change the culture, you have to change the system.","Entrepreneurship is not really building a product, it's not having an idea, it's not being in the right place at the right time. It's fundamentally company building.","The grim reality is that most start-ups fail. Most new products are not successful. Yet the story of perseverance, creative genius, and hard work persists.","Entrepreneurs can't forecast accurately, because they are trying something fundamentally new. So they will often be laughably behind plan - and on the brink of success.","Science and vision are not opposites or even at odds. They need each other. I sometimes hear other startup folks say something along the lines of: 'If entrepreneurship was a science, then anyone could do it.' I'd like to point out that even science is a science, and still very few people can do it, let alone do it well.","Prove to yourself that your business, in micro-scale at least, creates value. If you believe it, you'll find it that much easier to convince potential investors, partners and employees, too.","There is no greater country on Earth for entrepreneurship than America. In every category, from the high-tech world of Silicon Valley, where I live, to University R&D labs, to countless Main Street small business owners, Americans are taking risks, embracing new ideas and - most importantly - creating jobs.","Learning to see waste and systematically eliminate it has allowed lean companies such as Toyota to dominate entire industries. Lean thinking defines value as 'providing benefit to the customer'; anything else is waste.","Most entrepreneurs don't need as many customers as they think. A lot of people think 10 is too few for a sample. But if all 10 refused a product, why is that not enough? If you want 100, 1,000 or a million customers, you first have to get 10.","When it comes to meritocracy and diversity, the symbolic is real. And that means that simple actions that reduce bias, such as blind resume or application screening, are a double win: they reduce implicit bias and they help communicate our commitment to meritocracy.","It's a really paradoxical thing. We want to think big, but start small. And then scale fast. People think about trying to build the next Facebook as trying to start where Facebook is today, as a major global presence.","I bet the people who are in the auto industry right now have more than 10,000 good ideas about what might work and what we need to do is not come up with more good ideas. We need to go and test as many of those good ideas as possible.","There was a study done in the early 20th century of all the entrepreneurs who entered the automobile industry around the same time as Henry Ford; there were something like 500 automotive companies that got funded, had the internal combustion engine, had the technology, and had the vision. Sixty percent of them folded within a couple of years.","Building the right product requires systematically and relentlessly testing that vision to discover which elements of it are brilliant, and which are crazy.","I believe for the first time in history, entrepreneurship is now a viable career.","The reality is the Lean Startup method is not about cost, it is about speed. Lean startups waste less money, because they use a disciplined approach to testing new products and ideas.","Start-up success is not a consequence of good genes or being in the right place at the right time. Success can be engineered by following the right process, which means it can be learned, which means it can be taught.","Nowadays people talk about PayPal's founders as prescient geniuses who would inevitably change the world. It was, however, not so obvious that PayPal would taste its first major success by helping people sell Beanie Babies on eBay. But they had a vision, a hope, and the perseverance to try multiple iterations until they got it right.","In my first start-up, I had an initial advertising budget of $5 per day total. That would buy us 100 clicks per day. At $5 per day, marketing people scoffed and said that is too small to matter. But if you think about it, to an engineer, 100 real humans everyday giving your product a try means you can really start improving.","Except in very narrow cases, where there's breakthrough science that needs patent production, worrying about competitors is a waste of time. If you can't out iterate someone who is trying to copy you, you're toast anyway.","Most phenomenal startup teams create businesses that ultimately fail. Why? They built something that nobody wanted.","It doesn't matter if you call it a boom or a bubble. The startup business moves in cycles, and what goes up will eventually come down.","Entrepreneurs always pitch their idea as 'the X of Y', so this is going to be 'the Microsoft of food.' And yet disruptive innovations usually don't have that character. Most of the time, if something seems like a good idea, it probably isn't.","You know how people always talk about how vision is the key to entrepreneurship and perseverance and really seeing what other people don't see? We can actually redeem a fair amount of that folk wisdom.","Start-ups make so many mistakes that the challenge to identify the root cause of a failure is tough. But believing in your own plan is probably the worst.","Most companies are busy making their products worse, not better. Updating is almost always a disaster.","When we're in the shower, when we're thinking about our idea - boy, does it sound brilliant. But the reality is that most of our ideas are actually terrible.","It was 1999, and we were building a way for college kids to create online profiles for the purpose of sharing... with employers. Oops. I vividly remember the moment I realized my company was going to fail. My co-founder and I were at our wits' end. By 2001, the dot-com bubble had burst, and we had spent all our money.","If your goal is to make money, becoming an entrepreneur is a sucker's bet. Sure, some entrepreneurs make a lot of money, but if you calculate the amount of stress-inducing work and time it takes and multiply that by the low likelihood of success and eventual payoff, it is not a great way to get rich.","I actually believed if you work hard enough it was inevitable you'd succeed. Then I lived the 'Social Network' movie, but only the first half. The hardest part is the grueling work of constantly being wrong.","The attributes for entrepreneurs cut both ways. You need the ability to ignore inconvenient facts and see the world as it should be and not as it is. This inspires people to take huge leaps of faith. But this blindness to facts can be a liability, too. The characteristics that help entrepreneurs succeed can also lead to their failure.","Vanity metrics are the numbers you want to publish on TechCrunch to make your competitors feel bad.","The problem with entrepreneurship is we are often working really hard producing high quality products that no-one wants. The creation of stuff is not valued.","We need to reengineer companies to focus on figuring out who the customer is, what's the market and what kind of product you should build.","I can't say I'm not grateful to have journalists writing about me as a genius. But I know it's not true. I'm not confused. I understand that success comes through a lot of failure and a lot of very embarrassing failure. People want to create the next Facebook, but they are too afraid to create the next Facemash.","A lot of entrepreneurs hate big companies. But if you hate them so much, why are you trying to build a new one? The truth is, as soon as a startup has any kind of success whatsoever, it will face big company problems.","HubSpot has used the lean startup method to build a spectacularly successful company. What I particularly love about HubSpot is that they are so geeked out on data analysis and making evidence-based decisions, which are at the heart of the Lean Startup process.","The mistake isn't releasing something bad. The mistake is to launch it and get PR people involved. You don't want people to start amping up expectations for an early version of your product. The best entrepreneurship happens in low-stakes environments where no one is paying attention, like Mark Zuckerberg's dorm room at Harvard.","Meritocracy is a good thing. Whenever possibly, people should be judged based on their work and results, not superficial qualities.","At IMVU, the cost of customer acquisition through our five-dollar-a-day AdWords campaign was less than twenty-five cents. Our revenue from those same customers was more than a dollar.","When I meet with most entrepreneurial teams, I ask them a simple question: How do you know that you're making progress? Most of them really can't answer that question.","The Lean Startup has evolved into a movement that is having a significant impact on how companies are built, funded and scaled.","There's nothing wrong with raising venture capital. Many lean startups are ambitious and are able to deploy large amounts of capital. What differentiates them is their disciplined approach to determining when to spend money: after the fundamental elements of the business model have been empirically validated.","Our educational system is not preparing people for the 21st Century. Failure is an essential part of entrepreneurship. If you work hard, you can get an 'A' pretty much guaranteed, but in entrepreneurship, that's not how it works.","In the industrial world we have the problem of having more productive capacity than we know what to do with. That's at the root of the unemployment crisis: we've got so productive at making things, we don't require people to be involved in making the basics of life any more. Or nearly as many people.","When Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak created Apple computer in a garage in Palo Alto, it heralded the beginning of the PC revolution that ultimately dealt a death-blow to dozens of older companies.","The United States is locked in a new arms race for that most precious resource - the future entrepreneurs upon whom economic growth depends. Substantial research shows that immigrants play a key role in American job creation.","There is much that public policy can do to support American entrepreneurs. Health insurance reform will make it easier for entrepreneurs to take a chance on a new business without putting their family's health at risk. Tort reform will make it easier to take prudent risks on new products in a number of sectors.","Famous pivot stories are often failures but you don't need to fail before you pivot. All a pivot is is a change is strategy without a change in vision. Whenever entrepreneurs see a new way to achieve their vision - a way to be more successful - they have to remain nimble enough to take it.","As an entrepreneur, I knew that if my company failed, I could always try again. So I often felt that the only real risk of true financial ruin came from the possibility of a serious illness that either exceeded my insurance plans lifetime limits, or was not covered due to rescission.","Most start-up companies fail and it is smart public policy to help entrepreneurs increase their odds of succeeding. But, the biggest loss to our economy is not all the start-ups that didn't make it: It's the ones that might have been created but weren't.","Here in Silicon Valley, I have taken part in hundreds of conversations trying to convince people to dive in and become entrepreneurs. All too often, innovators with good, safe, jobs are unwilling to put their family's access to health care at risk by walking away from company-backed medical insurance."],"Eric Ripert":["I don't think I have an obsession, however I do eat chocolate every day.","Chefs are leaders in their own little world.","You don't become a chef to become famous.","Having sharp, great knives will enable you to cook very precisely. Knife skills are essential in cooking.","I don't like it when I go to a restaurant and I'm lectured from the menu.","If you can't think like an onion or a carrot or a tomato, you may be a technician, but you won't understand what you're doing, and your dish will be flat.","I'm very inspired by other cultures and very often use what I perceive to be exotic ingredients.","When I am about to have a difficult project, I dream I am climbing a mountain. When everything is going fine, I dream I am going down the mountain.","Factory farming's evil; you know that.","I am a Buddhist, therefore I should not be collecting anything - however, I have a collection of Buddhas. I have a lot of them.","A lot of foreign people say, when asking about eating habits, 'What is your guilty pleasure?' I have no guilt. Whatever I do, I enjoy and it's the point. I think if you start to feel guilty about it, that's a problem. So, no guilty pleasures. I have pleasure and no guilt at all.","I just find the world very exciting and beautiful everywhere.","I'm fascinated by Japanese cuisine.","America is a such a melting pot, I'm not sure if roast chicken is the classic comfort food for everybody.","I see a lot of people who change careers in the middle of their life and they think it's a good idea to come in the kitchen.","Cooks build muscles; we can stand all day long on our feet and not feel the pain.","Nobody wants an ugly book.","I find the organic wave much more interesting in America than in France.","California is lucky, the East Coast is lucky because we get great seafood and a lot of produce from Florida, locally in good weather, but in the winter we have to buy it.","When you are 25, 30, you know, you have no responsibility, no mortgage, no kids, no retirement to think about, nothing.","In a professional kitchen, the idea is to have your cooks not moving much while they're cooking. You want them to stay in the same spot.","I like very much Louis Vuitton. My wife loves it too.","To me, it's very important to have time at the restaurant but also time with family and time for myself.","There is great food in Vegas.","For me, I do not wish to build an empire.","Some chefs go crazy with one restaurant, and if I had 20, I would go nuts.","I like the dynamic of PBS. They're very honest and authentic.","The nature of human beings is to eat meat and fruits and vegetables, and therefore we have to kill animals. I don't have a problem with that. But it's a sacred moment. It's a gift of life.","I don't follow the food trends.","As young cook, especially in France, they're very tough in the kitchen. The idea is to make you humble and learn fast.","Obviously California is fantastic in terms of produce, vegetables.","I come from a family of farmers on both sides of my family.","Money is not necessarily, although it helps a lot for happiness, it's not necessarily the best way to be happy, to be rich, you know.","I am not a picture guy. I like to live in the present and keep the image of the past vivid in my mind. I don't need the precision of the picture.","I am totally anti-technology.","It has been stressful to be a French resident in America.","The Cheesecake Factory's not that bad.","I barely speak English.","When I see someone who has responsibilities, most of the time I can pinpoint that person because of the way he carries himself.","I am convinced that if you serve great value, people will come to you.","Everybody wants to support his own region and economy and farming. If we can preserve the land and if we can preserve the ocean, we all know, deep inside that we're doing the right thing.","A lot of people believe that when you are Buddhist, you are the Dalai Lama. I'm certainly not.","It took me all my life to learn how to salt a tomato.","It's a very naive idea to think that the chef is cooking everything, and, on top of it, is irreplaceable. That would mean that basically he is the only genius, and there are idiots all around him, which doesn't make sense.","I never pressure myself to do something I don't want to do.","I'm a very bad baker.","I like working in silence.","One thing I don't like is complaints."],"Eric Roberts":["Sometimes movie-making happens like clockwork; other times, like a car accident.","Well, I quit smoking three weeks ago and I had a hard day today not smoking.","My wife and I have so much fun when we travel and find anything... like stray cats and squirrels.","But if you love animals for all the right reasons- and that's just love and affection- then you're going to go after animals who need you.","Yeah, some of my college friends and I have been tinkering around for years, you know, just for fun.","I think maybe Mr. Sinise and Mr. Bacon have slightly bigger egos than I do.","We loved being in Russia and would love to go back again, especially to visit my namesake.","I did have a dog for a few years when I was little, but then just really had cats until I was about 21.","And then I bought my own horse, which I had until it died.","Years later I made a movie with Wayne Newton, who has Arabians.","We consider all our animals to be our kids.","I'm a real bore.","I ride my horses three to four times a week.","And I'm as attached to my wife as anybody can be to another human being.","The earth is a great big orphanage for most animals.","But I can't remember who is in my CD player now.","My first four roles were all nice guys, Raggedy Man being one of them.","I have a movie coming out called Spun, which will be at the Toronto Film Fest.","But the thing about bad guys is that they have the biggest bosomed blond, they have great clothes and cars, and get great death scenes.","I'm really good with fighting with my feet.","Sylvester Stallone is very funny and he's a great guy to hang out with.","As I've gotten older I look like a man, finally.","The point of my explanation is I'm very subjective when it comes to describing my characters: they are all a little bit a part of me from the outside in or the inside out - but to put your mind at ease, I built Paul Snider from the outside in."],"Eric Rohmer":["You have to know how to go against the trend of the times.","I don't think that my films are 'literary'; they are based on the most ordinary things of life.","I think that high art reposes on popular art, without one there cannot be another.","I don't owe my success to state subsidies but to a faithful public which has sustained me.","Western civilization shapes the content of my films, provides me with subjects that haven't been used before.","The French are very individualistic.","The French don't seek out alliances except when there are difficulties."],"Eric Roth":["Ultimately it doesn't matter whether you go forwards or backwards: you need to live your life as well as you can.","The wish fulfillment of growing younger is not necessarily all it's cracked up to be. You have new problems that arise which you are not anticipating and you deal with the same problems you would deal with if you were ageing normally: what is the end of life about? What have I accomplished?","When I met Richard Leakey, I thought, 'This is the most charismatic man I've ever met.' He has no legs. He lost them when his plane was sabotaged. But he's an interesting, sort of narcissistic guy."],"Eric S. Raymond":["The beginnings of the hacker culture as we know it today can be conveniently dated to 1961, the year MIT acquired the first PDP-1.","Thompson and Ritchie were among the first to realize that hardware and compiler technology had become good enough that an entire operating system could be written in C, and by 1978 the whole environment had been successfully ported to several machines of different types.","A critical factor in its success was that the X developers were willing to give the sources away for free in accordance with the hacker ethic, and able to distribute them over the Internet.","When are programmers happy? They're happy when they're not underutilized - when they're not bored - and also when they're not overburdened with inappropriate specifications or meaningless bureaucracies. In other words, programmers are happiest when they're working efficiently. This is a general preference in creative work.","Berkeley hackers liked to see themselves as rebels against soulless corporate empires.","In the beginning, there were Real Programmers.","The ARPAnet was the first transcontinental, high-speed computer network.","If Unix could present the same face, the same capabilities, on machines of many different types, it could serve as a common software environment for all of them.","The workstation-class machines built by Sun and others opened up new worlds for hackers.","For the first time, individual hackers could afford to have home machines comparable in power and storage capacity to the minicomputers of ten years earlier - Unix engines capable of supporting a full development environment and talking to the Internet.","In early 1993, a hostile observer might have had grounds for thinking that the Unix story was almost played out, and with it the fortunes of the hacker tribe.","Linux evolved in a completely different way. From nearly the beginning, it was rather casually hacked on by huge numbers of volunteers coordinating only through the Internet.","As a Facebook user, do I have control of the data Facebook keeps about me? Concretely: can I examine and modify that data using tools of my choosing which are built for my needs?","Does Facebook act as though I own my online life, or as though it does? Concretely: Can I control what data it shares with other users, with advertisers, and with business partners?","Does Facebook behave like a tool in my hand, or a firehose designed to spew at me in accordance with other peoples' agendas? Concretely: can I write my own client to present a filtered view of the Facebook stream, or have other people do that for me?","Money is just a way to keep score. The best people in any field are motivated by passion. That becomes more true the higher the skill level gets.","People are happiest when they're the most productive. People enjoy tasks, especially creative tasks, when the tasks are in the optimal-challenge zone: not too hard and not too easy. To some extent, that has always been true. But it becomes even more true as work becomes more about brains and creativity.","People who study primate societies make a distinction between two kinds of cultural interactions, agonic and hedonic. In agonic societies, you gain status by asserting dominance over others. In hedonic societies, you gain status by drawing attention to yourself. Open source is a hedonic culture."],"Eric San":["My scratching I don't really think communicates to intelligent life forms. Anyone with more than one brain cell would think Kid Koala music is completely retarded.","I try and make little stories. Whether it's with a pencil or with bits of records, it's really the same thing.","Nothing to do with anything, something to do with everything.","Dear motorist on the information superhighway. I'm sorry I do not have a car.","We're on tour to kind of explain why we do what we do, how its done and how we put it together.","There's individual turntable setups devoted to piano, bass, drums and a set for soloing as well. We like to try and explore the gamut of what a turntable can do.","Playing with decks, for me, has always been about trying new things. I make it a point to keep trying different things, keep pushing it a little bit at a time.","Eventually it just got really crazy. Less and less oxygen in the apartment.","Even though you were radiated doesn't mean you get to have that sort of power.","If you can understand the humor in the drawing part you'll probably get the humor in the audio part.","It's funny how making odd noises can get you into strange situations sometimes.","Eventually we want to do a puppet musical with turntables in the orchestra pit.","I really enjoyed the sort of real crazy, eclectic layering stuff and how it all worked together. I could tell it was some of it was derivative of something. I could tell that certain things were being looped around and I just really enjoyed the way that it all came together.","A lot of the stuff I've accumulated over the last few years of touring I thought was really interesting. Like sounds, sound bites, and beats even, but they weren't good dance beats they weren't ones anyone would want to rap over or anything.","If you met my dad, I think a lot of things would be put to rest. Because my pops is a pretty silly guy. But, Coldcut, they're based in the U.K. I'm a big fan of jazz music, so American music has had a big influence on what I listen to.","When I'm playing with the band or playing with some projects or some of my own stuff it's about the musical approach. That would be the more turntablist approach to things of where it's strictly about music.","When the generation after me started getting on the cut, a lot of them would call me over to hang out or go jam and scratch and they were always separate from each other.","When I started, there weren't that many kids doing it in the city, but the in the wave after me there were a lot of them and they actually never spoke to each other.","I realized that we were all sort of conspiring, well, not conspiring against each other, but all this cloak and dagger stuff and I was like; what is this?","You can say battle or war or whatever, but in the end, it's music. It's not really violent in intent at all, it's really just about expression and celebrating that in itself.","I'm not here to battle anybody. In the end it's just an instrument. That shouldn't be a concept."],"Eric Schlosser":["Fast food is popular because it's convenient, it's cheap, and it tastes good. But the real cost of eating fast food never appears on the menu.","One might expect that the families of murder victims would be showered with sympathy and support, embraced by their communities. But in reality they are far more likely to feel isolated, fearful, and ashamed, overwhelmed by grief and guilt, angry at the criminal-justice system, and shunned by their old friends.","McDonald's revolutionized fast food. They introduced a way to eat food without knives, forks or plates. Most fast foods can be eaten while steering the wheel of a car and the restaurants are usually drive through.","Fast food chains spend a large amount of marketing to get the attention of children. People form their eating habits as children so they try to nurture clients as youngsters.","I'm a huge supporter of animal rights - and I've been an outspoken critic of the cruelties routinely inflicted on livestock at factory farms. But it really bothers me that the mistreatment of pigs and chickens and cows seems to attract a lot more attention and spark a lot more outrage than the abuse of immigrant workers.","Hey, I used to eat at McDonald's: I liked the taste of the food, especially the French fries.","Most fast food is fried. Fried food tastes great, and people don't seem to care about the fat aspect.","Studies have found that preparing your own food is usually healthier and less expensive than buying fast food. But most people just don't have the time.","The fast-food industry is in very good company with the lead industry and the tobacco industry in how it tries to mislead the public, and how aggressively it goes after anybody who criticizes its business practices.","Like Hollywood movies, MTV and blue jeans, fast food has become one of America's major cultural exports.","Different people, in good faith, can look at the same fact and interpret it differently. But that's where an interesting conversation begins.","I can understand why a single parent, working two jobs, would find it easier to stop at McDonald's with the kids rather than cook something from scratch at home.","McDonald's has been extraordinary at site selection; it was a pioneer in studying the best places for retail locations. One of the things it did is study very carefully where sprawl was headed.","As a matter of fact, most cases of food poisoning are never linked back to their source.","I think it's important that people know what they are eating and especially to know what their children are eating.","Very few people realize that the U.S. government does not have the power to order the recall of contaminated meat.","I think there should be very strict limits on the pathogens that can be sold in your meat. There should be limits on disease-causing pathogens. Tests should determine whether the meat is contaminated or not, and you shouldn't be allowed to sell contaminated meat.","It's possible to go to the market, buy good ingredients, and make yourself a healthy meal for less than it costs to buy a value meal at McDonald's.","The symptoms of food poisoning often don't appear for days after the contaminated meal was eaten. As a result, most cases of food poisoning are never properly diagnosed.","It's not a question of McDonald's vanishing from the face of the earth. It's a question of these companies assuming some more responsibility for what they're selling.","Since 1966, hundreds of books have been published that follow murderers along their paths of destruction. Every serial killer, it seems, now has a biographer or two.","I aimed at the public's heart, and by accident I hit it in the stomach.","Firstly, should we be selling and buying irradiated meat? I think that's up to the consumer, ultimately. But the second point is, this irradiated meat should be clearly and unmistakably labeled as irradiated meat.","The importance of recalls is to show that contaminated meat is getting out the door. And when you look at these recalls, in many ways the most disturbing thing about these recalls is how little of the meat actually winds up back at the plant.","I've been called communist, socialist, anti-American.","I hadn't planned on being an activist.","By birth and upbringing, I think I'm emotionally resilient. I don't feel like I'm a depressive person.","I was introduced to the world of modern food production in the mid-1990s, while researching an article about California's strawberry industry for the 'Atlantic Monthly.'","I really like hamburgers and French fries, and I don't consider myself some kind of gourmand.","By the way, I'm not a vegetarian. I have a lot of respect for people who are vegetarian for religious or ethical reasons.","One of my favorite dishes in the world used to be steak tartare, which is raw ground beef seasoned and then served.","'Fast Food Nation' appeared as an article in 'Rolling Stone' before it was a book, so I was extending it from the article, and by that time, everyone could read the article.","'Fast Food Nation' isn't about my journey into the dark world of fast food and the prison book is not about my journey into the prison world. I'm not using myself as any kind of narrative link.","I'd like to think that, in the United States, you can criticize a company that makes hamburgers without having to worry about what might happen to you.","Yes, a cheeseburger and fries is probably my favourite meal. But I don't eat ground beef anymore.","I'm just angry at the sort of things that are winding up in ground beef. I'm angry that other people - mainly children - are going to be sickened by eating a hamburger.","The fear of murder has grown so enormous in the United States that it leaves a taint, like the mark of Cain, on everyone murder touches.","Even academic elites are drawn to the figure of the murderer, which has long been a focus of attention for psychiatrists, sociologists, and criminologists.","I never consciously set out to model myself after Upton Sinclair.","The thing that's been inhibiting long-form investigative reporting is fear - fear of being sued, of being unpopular, of being criticized by very powerful groups.","Journalists aren't supposed to be cheerleaders.","I try to persuade people to act in ways that are not only in their own interest, but in the interest of society at large.","There is a growing market today for local, organic foods produced by small farmers. And farmers' markets have played a large role in making that happen.","I'd been eating fast food all my life without thinking about it. And the more I learned about the subject, the more intrigued I became.","If you eat, you should be concerned about the people who are providing you with food.","I'm all in favor of animal rights, but I'd like to see the food movement take a much stronger stand in defense of basic human rights. If you're a vegan or a vegetarian, you should care about the people who are picking your fruits and vegetables by hand."],"Eric Schmidt":["You have to fight for your privacy or you lose it.","The rise of Google, the rise of Facebook, the rise of Apple, I think are proof that there is a place for computer science as something that solves problems that people face every day.","I still believe that sitting down and reading a book is the best way to really learn something.","If you look at the history of technology over a couple hundred years, it's all about time compression and making the globe smaller. It's had positive effects, all the ones that we know. So we're much less likely to have the kind of terrible misunderstandings that led to World War I, for example.","The Internet is the first thing that humanity has built that humanity doesn't understand, the largest experiment in anarchy that we have ever had.","The coach doesn't have to play the sport as well as you do. They have to watch you and get you to be your best.","YouTube's traffic continues to grow very quickly. Video is something that we think is going to be embedded everywhere. And it makes sense, from Google's perspective, to be the operator of the largest site that contains all that video.","The adult way to run a business is to run it more like a country. They have disputes, yet they've actually been able to have huge trade with each other. They're not sending bombs at each other.","Even though Google may do very well, there will always be an alternative to what Google is doing, and people will always have the free choice... because there's no way for us to prevent them from exercising that choice. That is one of the key aspects of why the Internet has been so successful. No technologies can dominate.","There's nothing that cannot be found through some search engine or on the Internet somewhere.","I actually think most people don't want Google to answer their questions. They want Google to tell them what they should be doing next.","I had a rule that I had to go to bed before the sun came up. So I used to look up the sunrise times because I thought it would be bad karma to be going to bed as dawn was arriving.","There is a science to managing high tech businesses, and it needs to be respected. One of them is that in technology businesses, leadership is temporary. It's constantly recycling. So the asset has limited lifetime.","If you have something that you don't want anyone to know, maybe you shouldn't be doing it in the first place.","Washington - having spent a lot of time there, I grew up there and have spent a lot of time there recently - is largely defined by detailed analytical views and policy choices that are not very good. You know, each policy choice has a winner and a loser, right? Somebody's ox is getting gored.","In general in technology, if you own a platform that's valuable, you can monetize it.","If you think about the history of the PC industry, the PC industry has essentially been nothing but acquisitions by one company or another. Dell is the outlier. Dell built its own culture. They automated themselves to be the most efficient manufacturer.","People are building communities of people who use video. They're sharing them. YouTube's traffic continues to grow very quickly.","Your car should drive itself. It's amazing to me that we let humans drive cars... It's a bug that cars were invented before computers.","Google is more than a business. Google is a belief system. And we believe passionately in the open Internet model.","Remember, when you go to YouTube, you do a search. When you go to Google, you do a search. As we get the search integrated between YouTube and Google, which we're working on, it will drive a lot of traffic into both places. So the trick, overall, is generating more searches, more uses of Google.","Google is very much a not-invented-here, build-it-ourselves culture.","When you use Google, do you get more than one answer? Of course you do. Well, that's a bug. We have more bugs per second in the world. We should be able to give you the right answer just once. We should know what you meant.","Half of Google's revenue comes from selling text-based ads that are placed near search results and are related to the topic of the search. Another half of its revenues come from licensing its search technology to companies like Yahoo.","When the Internet publicity began, I remember being struck by how much the world was not the way we thought it was, that there was infinite variation in how people viewed the world.","Amazon has well passed any expectations of its ability to change distribution and marketing.","The funny thing about advertising is that it's not a zero-sum game... Historically, in the digital ad world, pie has gotten larger and it's possible for everyone to win, and it's perfectly possible that will continue to be true for quite some time.","The characteristic of great innovators and great companies is they see a space that others do not. They don't just listen to what people tell them; they actually invent something new, something that you didn't know you needed, but the moment you see it, you say, 'I must have it.'","I do want to emphasize that we've seen an explosion in the use of Google Maps and Google Earth for education. The earth is a special place. It is our home and it's why we're all here. And the ability to see what's really going on the earth, the good stuff and the bad stuff, at the level that you can, is phenomenal.","We used to think that the enterprise was the hardest customer to satisfy, but we were wrong. It turns out, consumers are harder than the enterprise because the consumer will not give you a second chance.","Facial recognition, completely unmonitored, can be used for very bad things. It can be used for stalking, for example.","The Internet is really about highly specialized information, highly specialized targeting.","We want to make sure the thing you're looking for is on Google 100 percent of the time.","We weren't here to hope and hang on. We wanted to win.","And the more broadband we can get globally, the better. It's better for the world; it's better for our advertisers; it's better for Google.","The average American doesn't realize how much of the laws are written by lobbyists.","People are surprised to find out that an awful lot of people think that they're idiots.","The thing that people seem to miss about not just Google, but also our competitors, Yahoo, eBay and so forth, is that there's an awful lot of communities that have never been served by traditional media.","Google docs and spreadsheets don't work if you're on an airplane. But it's a technical problem that is going to get solved. Eventually you will be able to work on a plane as if you are connected and, then when you get reconnected to the Internet, your computer will just synchronize with the cloud.","Fast learners win.","I don't believe society understands what happens when everything is available, knowable and recorded by everyone all the time.","The computing world is very good at things that we are not. It is very good at memory.","People assume that computers will do everything that humans do. Not good. People are different from each other and they are all really different from computers.","I used to say that you'll have 10 IP address on your body... and it looks like that's going to happen through medical monitoring.","People are good at intuition, living our lives. What are computers good at? Memory.","The issues of wireless versus wireline gets very messy. And that's really an FCC issue, not a Google issue.","There's a set of people who are intrinsic oppositionists to everything Google does.","I think I could argue that the press has more impact on politics than corporations.","The core problem is that the world is full of people who would like to take 99 per cent of the information that's on the Internet, and eliminate 1 per cent. Everyone has their own thing they don't like.","In whatever number of years I have on Earth, I think that promoting the values of free expression, the openness of the Internet, that's the best use of my time.","The more broadband we can get globally, the better. It's better for the world; it's better for our advertisers; it's better for Google.","We know that Google Earth and Google Maps have had a tremendous impact on Google traffic, users, brand, adoption, and advertisers. We also know Google News, for example, which we don't monetize, has had a tremendous impact on searches and on query quality. We know those people search more. Because we've measured it.","If you think about YouTube, YouTube is a 'searching the world's videos' problem, right? They all have to be there, but how do you find them? What I guess I'm trying to say is that search is still the killer app.","Countries that have the Internet already are not going to turn it off. And so the power of freedom, the power of ideas will spread, and it will change those societies in very dramatic ways.","In our case, we focus on quality, and we have a very simple model. If we show fewer ads that are more targeted, those ads are worth more. So we're in this strange situation where we show a smaller number of ads and we make more money because we show better ads. And that's the secret of Google.","A lot of the Google inventions came from engineers just screwing around with ideas. And then management would see them, and we'd say, 'Boy, that's interesting. Let's add some more engineers.'","I think to some degree one of the strengths of the high tech industry is that people are actually willing to tell you things. When I went to Novell, I didn't know how to be a CEO, so I went in and I called all sorts of CEOs I knew. I called in a favor. I wanted to come by and listen to them tell me what it's like to be a CEO.","I've never met a person who does not want a safer world, better medical care and education for their children, and peace with their neighbours. I just don't meet those people. What I meet, over and over again, as I travel around, is that the essential human condition is optimistic - in every one of these places.","Google was founded to get information to everybody. A by-product of that strategy is that we invented an advertising business which has provided great economics that allows us to build the servers, hire the employees, create value.","I think of Google as a set of overlapping things. It's a consumer platform, consumer phenomenon of which search is its fundamental activity, but there are many other things you can do than search... I think of Google as an advertising company who services the broader advertising industry in the ways that you know.","The policy of America to deny visas to technically trained people in the U.S. and shipped to other countries, where they create companies that compete with America, has to be the stupidest policy of all the U.S. government policies.","Washington is an incumbent protection machine. Technology is fundamentally disruptive.","People who bet against the Internet, who think that somehow this change is just a generational shift, miss that it is a fundamental reorganizing of the power of the end user. The Internet brings tremendous tools to the end user, and that end user is going to use them.","One of the unintended negative consequences of online advertising has been the loss of value in traditional classifieds. It's simply quicker, simply easier for an end user who's online, on a broadband connection, to look things up and to figure out what they want to buy.","It's very difficult for governments to dominate the Internet because it's so difficult to control. People want to be free. People want to hear multiple voices. They want to make their own decisions. And people who see things will report things.","Silicon Valley's involvement with Washington dates from one event, which was John Scully - who was the CEO of Apple - had dinner with President Clinton and Vice President Gore in 1993. And we're all going, like, 'What's going on? Why would we have dinner with the president?'","I use Google+, and I find the quality of the comments are very sophisticated because there is more trust inside of Google+ than there is inside of Twitter and Facebook, for example.","I've come to a view that humans will continue to do what we do well, and that computers will continue to do what they do very well, and the two will coexist, but in different spaces.","Since I have access to every, every crisis in the world because it's always blaring at me on cable television, that doesn't mean I have to worry about every one of them. This is also known as knowing where the off button is.","I think it's pretty clear that the Internet as a whole has not had a strong notion of identity. And identity means, 'Who am I?' Fundamentally, what Facebook has done has built a way to figure out who people are.","Google's architectural model around broadband and services and so forth plays very well to the powerful devices and services Apple is doing. We're a perfect back end to the problems that they're trying to solve."],"Eric Schneiderman":["Every day, in every city and town across the country, police officers are performing vital services that help make their communities safer.","Our investigation has found that, unlike traditional fantasy sports, daily fantasy sports companies are engaged in illegal gambling under New York law, causing the same kinds of social and economic harms as other forms of illegal gambling and misleading New York consumers.","Gambling is entertainment. People go to casinos to be entertained.","We're going after the possibilities of tax fraud, insurance fraud, securities fraud. We're going to look at this stuff very closely. We have the jurisdiction, we have the resources, and we have the will.","Daily fantasy sports is much closer to online poker than it is to traditional fantasy sports.","After the 1970s, when President Nixon's illegal campaign cash was used as a secret slush fund to pay for the Watergate burglary and cover-up, Americans have demanded to know where the money fueling our elections is coming from.","Games of chance often involve some amount of skill; this does not make them legal. Good poker players often beat novices. But poker is still gambling, and running a poker room - or online casino - is illegal in New York.","The right to vote is one of our nation's most important civil rights.","If you have faith in the public sector, as I do, you must be the harshest critic of corruption, waste and fraud in government.","My commitment to gender equality is rooted in the quintessentially American principle of equal justice under law.","People plead guilty or admit to crimes they didn't commit for various reasons. Certain interrogation procedures produce high rates of false confessions.","Right here in New York, people are struggling in working conditions not much safer or fairer than the sweatshops of 1911.","Abandoned homes become magnets for vandalism and crime. They drag down the property values of neighboring homes.","You wanna know people are held accountable if they engage in misconduct and that no one is above the law.","History teaches that the overwhelming majority of elected officials follow movement builders outside government when it comes to the new and risky... Once you recognize it, demand it and reward it, it will happen.","Once they are charged, too many poor New Yorkers find themselves trapped by our unjust bail system. Unable to pay for bail, they languish in Rikers Island or other jails while they await trial, regardless of guilt.","Equal justice means that there is not one set of rules for the powerful and another for everyone else.","Exercising the right to vote is essential to our democracy.","Organizing gives workers the power to lift themselves out of poverty and build a better future.","Obviously, Nevada doesn't prohibit all forms of gambling, but you have to submit yourself to a very rigorous regulatory process to run a gambling operation in Nevada.","You're not allowed to lure people into spending their money or betting their money based on false representations.","We can prevent unfair advantage, and we can avoid the destabilizing effect that high frequency trading can have.","Unions go hand-in-hand with a strong middle class.","When I was in the Senate, I worked to pass Women's Health and Wellness Act, which bars insurance companies from discriminating against the health care needs of women.","Anyone who believes in the essential role government can play in improving people's lives must also be the toughest critics of those who abuse the public trust.","I am running for Attorney General because I believe there is no higher calling than the pursuit of justice.","As the state's top lawyer, I am empowered to protect nonprofit donors from fraudulent solicitations and charitable assets from misuse.","Just as we demand that people take responsibility for their actions, we as a society must take responsibility for fighting injustice.","The memory of the 146 people who lost their lives in the Triangle Shirtwaist fire stands as a reminder that legal protections and workplace safety standards were won through a long struggle for social justice and at great human cost.","High-frequency traders are firms all around the world. They're massive investments. And there is an incredible race for speed now. People are paying hundreds of millions of dollars to shave milliseconds off.","I'm going to go after crime and corruption wherever it is. But I did focus particularly on the need to restore public confidence in essential institutions of both the public and private sector.","I don't like conflicts of interest; they should be eliminated or disclosed. I believe in transparency: that people have to really not just know but understand what they're buying and selling.","Ninety-five percent of the work in the attorney general's office is civil litigation and regulatory work, and I think I certainly have a lot more experience in that than most of the folks who have served in the office.","Prosecutors are all used to people who commit fraud making wild accusations when they're caught.","We're very interested in seeing what science Exxon has been using for its own purposes because they're tremendously active in offshore oil drilling in the Arctic, for example, where global warming is happening at a much more rapid rate than in more temperate zones.","In New York, we have laws against defrauding the public, defrauding consumers, defrauding shareholders.","There's nothing wrong with advocating for your own company.","The 2006 federal Internet gaming statute is not ambiguous. It does not prohibit gambling on fantasy sports.","My actual statement during the campaign was I want to be the sheriff of Wall Street, Albany and Main Street. I'm going to go after crime and corruption, wherever it is.","I don't think it's any secret that the public has lost confidence in the state government, and there's a lot of work that needs to be done on issues related to public integrity.","I'm very interested in the more grass-roots consequences of the economic meltdown: issues related to mortgage foreclosures, debt collection, and the practices of credit card companies and others who hold a lot of consumer debt.","I have three very simple principles. I don't like conflicts of interest; they should be eliminated or disclosed. I believe in transparency, that people have to really not just know but understand what they're buying and selling. And that you have to have enough capital to back up your promises.","Fraud is fraud. And consumers of any product - whether you want to buy a car, participate in fantasy football - our laws are very strong in New York and other states that you can't commit fraud.","We've got to do more to ensure that people who work full time are not living in poverty and that the massive gap between rich and poor - which is fundamentally un-American, as far as I'm concerned - is somehow dealt with.","Prosecutors are all used to persons who commit fraud making wild accusations when they're caught.","High-frequency traders are firms all around the world. They're massive investments.","The president and I had much more important stuff to talk about than Donald Trump. I've never discussed Mr. Trump with the president of the United States.","The credit reporting system suffers from inaccuracy and often from outright injustice.","You can't have some institutions that are protected by the law, not allowed to fail, and not held to account, and all the other companies in America are allowed to fail. You can't have equal justice under law and too big to fail.","Our review concludes that DraftKings'/FanDuel's operations constitute illegal gambling under New York law.","Daily fantasy sports is neither victimless nor harmless, and it is clear that DraftKings and FanDuel are the leaders of a massive, multi-billion-dollar scheme intended to evade the law and fleece sports fans across the country.","The right to organize is a fundamental right for American workers.","The Supreme Court should follow settled precedent and allow states like New York to manage our own labor relations to achieve labor peace and government efficiency and to continue our long tradition of support for workers.","My job is to enforce the law, without fear or favor.","Unlike most traditional, season-long fantasy sports sites, which make most of their money from administrative fees and advertising, FanDuel and DraftKings take a cut of every bet. That is what bookies do, and it is illegal in New York.","There are few people who exemplify the ideals of opportunity, entrepreneurship and commitment to the collective good than the great New Yorker and the face of the $10 bill, Alexander Hamilton.","A staunch abolitionist, Hamilton was one of the founding members of the New York Manumission Society. He was a trustee and namesake of Hamilton-Oneida Academy, an upstate New York school dedicated to educating Native-American boys.","If the Treasury Department should not remove Hamilton from the $10 bill, what should they do? The answer is fairly simple: Replace Andrew Jackson on the $20 bill.","Morally bankrupt wage practices and laws cannot hold.","We must use every tool at our disposal to lift the living standards of low-wage employees.","The secret's out: New York's Labor Law provides the power to help low-wage workers earn enough to meet their basic needs.","Lawmakers zealously guard their prerogatives, and as much as some might oppose a minimum-wage increase, they will not want to see the issue taken out of their hands.","When someone makes a claim against the state, that person must legally verify that the facts in the claim are true.","A statute that lets some wrongfully convicted individuals seek restitution but denies that right to others is an unjust and unequal application of the law.","I am not in the entertainment business; I am in the justice business.","Trump University had neither a license nor a charter from New York State certifying it as an institution of higher education.","As the state's chief law enforcement officer, it's my job to see that perpetrators of fraud are brought to justice.","These facts are clear: Trump University was an unlicensed enterprise promising students that they would become wealthy by learning Trump's real estate tips and strategies, taught by his handpicked instructors.","A factory-installed security measure - one that phone owners would have to opt out of, rather than opting in - could automatically render purloined devices inoperable on any network, anywhere in the world. No resale value, no thefts.","Manufacturers must accept responsibility for their customers' safety.","In the 1960s, the public demanded seat belts in cars, but automakers balked. Not until government intervened did seat belts become standard equipment. Now, no one would consider buying a vehicle without this basic safety feature.","Thieves sell to unscrupulous merchants who pay hundreds of dollars for phones - no questions asked - and then 'jailbreak' them. They unlock the units, erase their data, reprogram them, and put them up for resale.","When a donor is asked to contribute to a group whose innocuous-sounding name makes it appear to be doing work in the public interest, that donor should have a clear picture of where his or her money is going.","More money is being spent on our elections, with less disclosure of where that money is coming from, than ever before.","The workers who harvest our food have been systematically denied the basic rights that are granted to all other American workers. They can be fired for trying to form a union or for attempting to improve their working conditions. They are not eligible for overtime pay, disability, or even unemployment insurance.","By cracking down on wage theft, we can make sure workers and taxpayers are not getting ripped off by crooked employers.","Transactional politics requires us to be pragmatic about current realities and the state of public opinion. It's all about getting the best result possible given the circumstances here and now.","Transformational politics requires us to challenge the way people think about issues, opening their minds to better possibilities.","In 1980, a young Senator Al Gore held the first Congressional hearings on global warming.","Very few checklist liberals will focus on transformational work if they are rewarded or punished only for their transactional work.","In a system that disproportionately harms poor people and people of color, too many Americans have lost faith in the essential American principle of equal justice under law.","We must never stop fighting for a vision of American democracy in which we strive for and encourage the highest levels of voter turnout and participation.","I have the highest possible regard for the district attorneys in the State of New York.","When the trust between the police and the communities they serve breaks down, everyone is at risk.","New Yorkers must be able to trust the men and women of the NYPD. They must come forward to report crimes. And they must come forward as witnesses.","Here in New York, we are already seeing how climate change contributes to increasingly violent and extreme weather that has cost us dearly, in both damage and in lives.","The bottom line is clear: Climate change is a reality, and it is having a real impact.","No woman should have her personal health care decisions dictated by the religious beliefs of her boss.","I believe that in New York, we must have one set of rules for everyone - and that means women cannot be unfairly denied health coverage.","I look forward to continuing to serve the people of New York and making our state a safer place to live, work and raise families for many years to come.","That is the definition of equal justice under law: everyone gets a fair shot, everyone pays their fair share, and everyone plays by the same set of rules.","As New York's chief law enforcement officer, I have taken a hard line against those in state government who abuse the law they have sworn to uphold.","Throughout my career, I have made rooting out public corruption a top priority.","Every New Yorker has the right to clean air, safe drinking water, and healthy communities to raise their children - and you can rest assured that I will aggressively protect that right, not just on Earth Day, but every day.","We've sued out-of-state power plants that are polluting our air and led a coalition of attorneys general from Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, and Massachusetts against efforts in the U.S. House of Representatives to remove critical environmental regulations that protect New York communities from toxic pollution.","New Yorkers have been fortunate to have Andrew Cuomo as our Attorney General - protecting working New Yorkers against the banks, insurance companies and big corporations.","As Attorney General, my most important responsibility is keeping New Yorkers safe by enforcing the laws that protect our people from harm. But another fundamental part of my job is to seek to advance the basic American principle of equal justice under law.","For more than a century, states have sought to protect the integrity of the democratic process at the state and local level by regulating corporate spending in elections.","In 'Citizens United v. FEC', the Supreme Court ruled that sections of the federal campaign finance law known as McCain-Feingold imposed unconstitutional restrictions on the First Amendment rights of corporations.","Exxon Mobil and JPMorgan Chase each made more in profits in the first quarter of 2012 alone than the entire state budget of Montana. Without a doubt, multinational corporations like these have the resources to overwhelm the voices of the people.","Our elected representatives wisely enacted laws to protect our state and local governments from undue outside influence.","My office is committed to tearing down unlawful barriers to voting to ensure that all eligible voters are able to freely cast a ballot.","Language has historically stood as a barrier for some voters seeking to participate in the electoral process.","From the Bronx to Buffalo, cities and towns in New York have been plagued by what are commonly called zombie properties. These are homes that residents abandon - often after they have received a foreclosure notice - which then languish, uncared-for, until the foreclosure process is complete."],"Eric Sevareid":["The difference between the men and the boys in politics is, and always has been, that the boys want to be something, while the men want to do something.","Consultant: any ordinary guy more than fifty miles from home.","I'm sort of a pessimist about tomorrow and an optimist about the day after tomorrow.","Better to trust the man who is frequently in error than the one who is never in doubt.","The most distinguished hallmark of the American society is and always has been change.","The chief cause of problems is solutions.","Dealing with network executives is like being nibbled to death by ducks.","Next to power without honor, the most dangerous thing in the world is power without humor.","Men want power in order to do something. Boys want power in order to be something.","I have never quite grasped the worry about the power of the press. After all, it speaks with a thousand voices, in constant dissonance."],"Eric Shanteau":["Being happy outside the pool means fast swimming in the pool.","At 28, you need recovery time after training.","If I have one message to young swimmers about taking care of their bodies, it's definitely take care of your shoulders.","Obviously, losing a parent is very difficult. I miss my dad every day, but I know he would be proud to see me continuing to swim and going for another shot at the Olympics.","One of the things you learn when you get married is how you need to always work on continuing to make it better.","I'm really looking forward to just concentrating on the swimming part now instead of what's going on with me outside the pool.","When you get to an event like the Olympic Games, you can put too much pressure on yourself.","I've kind of got an out in cancer. It keeps things in perspective for me.","There's a lot more to life than just the Olympic Games.","I know there's life after the Olympics.","Most people take long breaks after Olympics. I needed some normalcy back in my life, so I came back to the pool.","Getting to the Olympics was, has always been, my swimming dream since I was 8 or 9 years old. You know, right after I started swimming it was, 'I want to make an Olympic team. That's where I want to be.'","I've been in a Speedo half my life. So I am really comfortable with my body.","I don't let myself get upset about the little nitpicky things anymore.","I don't know what cancer did to me but I put on probably 10 pounds of muscle and got a lot stronger in the weight room and during our dry-land stuff.","I think being an athlete prepares you for more things than people give us credit for.","I attacked my cancer diagnosis the same way I attack training and competing, and that's pretty fearless.","Olympic medals are the one medal that I don't have; I've won just about every other competition that I've been at.","After my cancer diagnosis, I really took my swimming to a new level.","I think you have to be weird to swim breaststroke."],"Eric Shinseki":["I have spent a lifetime watching kids make mistakes because they were not trained or well led or properly motivated to do well. I never faulted the kids; rather, I saw opportunity to train, to motivate, to improve leadership - not to punish the individual.","It's tough never being right.","The magnificent army that fought in Desert Storm is a great army, and it still is a magnificent army today. But it was one we designed for the Cold War, and the Cold War has been over for ten years now.","Well, let's assume the world is linear. If we required a certain amount of troops per 25,000 population in the Balkans, if the world is not radically different, something of the same extent is going to be needed in Iraq.","I am an armor officer.","I am an armor officer. I grew up as a part of the team that helped to field M-1s and M-60-A3s to the army back in 1980s. It's still a magnificent tank, and we designed it for the Cold War and Central Europe.","An army that fought and won a war decisively finds it even more difficult to undergo change.","In the army, we do two things every day. We train our soldiers, and then we grow them into leaders, because frankly, we don't hire out. We grow our own leaders.","More importantly, if you are in a position to hire, hire a veteran. They will be the best employees you have.","You don't get many do-overs in life.","It's important in any organization that if visions have any reality at all, it's because the organization believes that the vision is right and that they share in it. Otherwise, it becomes the good idea of one person, and that even more importantly contributes to the sense that it will not survive the departure of that individual.","If you are going to make a change, make it big and bold. Walk up to the biggest guy on the block, stand in his face and get it started. Then go around, brigade by brigade, making it make sense.","I do engage veterans. I meet with the veterans' service organizations monthly. It's a direct, no-holds-barred discussion. I travel to their conventions, where I speak to the veterans membership. I do travel. I've been to all 50 states. When I do, I engage veterans locally. So I get direct feedback from those veterans.","I spent five years working very hard to develop a relationship with the veterans' service organizations. We have together worked some major projects.","What I want veterans to know is that VA is here to care for them. VA is a good system - health care wise, safety wise - highly comparable to any other system out there. Our oversight reviews tell us that. I'm very comfortable in the quality of our system.","No veteran should have to wait for claims. If there's anybody impatient here, I am that individual."],"Eric Snow":["I'm a firm believer in the hustle game.","The deeper you get into the playoffs, obviously the better the opponent is. Which means they'll be better defensively, they'll rebound better, they don't turn the ball over.","I haven't seen one guy beat five people yet. It needs to be done collectively.","Whenever we don't turn the ball over, we're pretty productive. When you're turning the ball over, you're cutting down on offensive opportunities.","I'm very happy and excited to be re-joining the Sixers family as a part of their broadcast team. I spent my best and most enthusiastic years of my NBA career with this organization and its fans and I truly feel honored and blessed to have been given this opportunity to return."],"Eric Stoltz":["It just seems to me that the world's kind of a mess, and the more messy it gets, the more interested I am in escapist fare. Having a good time is something that isn't about the war in Iraq or the Asian flu or the Kyoto protocol - things that are horribly depressing to consider in our real lives. I'm eager to get away from them.","Let's not kid ourselves here, robots already run most of our world. We'll be their butlers soon enough.","It's hard not to get a big head in the film industry, there are people on a set paid to cater to your every need, from the minute you arrive until you go home. It's kind of strange, but not unpleasant.","There's a strange sense of accomplishment in making an independent film. Everything's against you; there's no time, and even less money - you bring a bottle of glue, chip in twenty bucks, and hope you all make it through the day. If you manage to finish it and it actually turns out to be pretty good, it's thrilling.","I think violence, cynicism, brutality and fashion are the staples of our diet. I think in the grand history of story-telling, going back to people sitting around fires, the dark side of human nature has always been very important. Movies are part of that tradition.","I'm a gentleman, if nothing else. It's taken me years to become one, but finally I have a sense of propriety.","It seems that whatever we do is somehow beyond reproach - murder, rape, drunk driving - as long as we go on a TV show and apologize.","My perfect day is constantly changing. Right now, it would be to lie around in a hammock reading with a portable phone and a table of food next to it. I would spend all day there. And that's all that I can possibly come up with on the spur of the moment.","I consider myself a very lucky man indeed.","I don't want to see the zipper in the back of the monster suit. Like everybody else who goes to the movies, I want to believe the monster is real.","I'm interested in doing movies I wouldn't normally be interested in doing.","I realize I'm a very lucky man. I love what I do, I love films, TV and theater, and the fact that I'm able to make a living at it staggers me.","When you're in a movie, they treat you like you're four years old and give you whatever you want.","Directing has only increased my admiration and respect for what it is that actors do.","I have several dogs and several cats who aren't really mine. In fact, they think that I am theirs. I'd like to have some goats and chickens, but I travel around too much.","I was up for Michael Corleone in 'The Godfather,' but, as I was only 10 at the time, I think Mr. Coppola made the right choice. The Julia Roberts role in 'Pretty Woman' held a bizarre allure for me. But, it's silly to look back with regret.","My first film as an actor was 'Fast Times at Ridgemont High,' a glorious experience that spoiled me for future films.","The '80s were a time of technical wonder in filmmaking; unfortunately, some colleges didn't integrate their film and theater departments - so you had actors who were afraid of the camera, and directors who couldn't talk to the actors.","I can count on one hand the directors who actually directed me.","Before I start directing a show, I try to spend a few weeks hanging around the set, getting to know the crew and talking to the actors about how they like to work. Who is fussy? Who is left-handed? Who wants to go home early, and who is the perfectionist?","To this day I over prepare. I draw storyboards for every scene - chicken scratches so crude that they amuse and horrify the crew. I send out shot lists, act out the scenes, and search for a theme that I can relate to. It's my favorite time of the process.","I try to read all news sources - not just CNN or FOX, but worldwide papers and journals, to get opinions from every end of the spectrum - and then I like to try to find out the cut and dried facts - and go from there.","I can relate to historical characters or imaginary ones. It doesn't matter if a story takes place in the future or in the present, as long as the story is compelling.","I've been directing more and more the last few years, I find it an enjoyable challenge.","I did a film called 'Fort McCoy,' based on a true story of one of the few internment camps during WWII that was actually in the United States.","Things happen to everybody in the course of a lifetime. Relationships end, people die, tragedy befalls everyone. So everyone has this wealth of experience, and the older you are the more you have to draw on.","My parents moved to American Samoa when I was three or four years old. My dad was principal of a high school there. It was idyllic for a kid. I had a whole island for a backyard. I lived there until I was eight years old and we moved to Santa Barbara.","But I've always felt that the less you know about an actor's personal life, the more you can get involved in the story in which he's playing a character. And I don't like to see movies where you know about everything that happens behind the scenes. I can't engage in the story if I know what's going on in the actor's head.","TV, in particular cable channels, has assumed the role of independent film.","I've been pretty lucky - or slothful - in that I've never been a 'career builder.' I take the jobs that come along that feel right, and that's left me fairly open to all genres, really. But with 'Caprica,' the complex, dark and very smart script was the draw.","I'll be directing some more 'Private Practice' episodes when we wrap 'Caprica.'","It seems I have a hard time being attracted to someone unless I respect what they do on some level. Otherwise, I would feel disdain for them. Which is not always pleasant in a relationship. Sometimes it's fun though.","You know, you grow up with the image of John Travolta being super cool - 'Saturday Night Fever,' Brian De Palma, handsome young god... he, in reality, is a very silly man. And I mean that in a good way. He'll walk around the set talking in little weird voices, making people laugh.","I think I'm wealthy. I make a good living for what I do. Well, it depends. If I'm doing an independent film I'm making no money - probably losing money. But if I'm doing a studio film, I'll make a decent wage. I can live for a year without working.","I know a lot of writers who would much rather be writing the Great American Novel, but they've got bills to pay and alimony, and so they take a job at a less-than-reputable paper. You know, you do what you gotta do.","I studied piano for many years, and I still play. I'm a complete amateur, and I wouldn't consider myself very good at all, but I enjoy it.","I have a love/hate relationship with just about all technology in my life. My first typewriter in particular. I had a helluva time putting new ribbon on it.","Recently I was directing an episode of 'Glee' and I lost my cell phone - and I didn't have time to buy a new one for three weeks. Well, the first few days I was anxious as hell, suffered the delirium tremens, didn't think I could make it through, etc. Then something kind of curious happened - I began to feel great."],"Eric Stonestreet":["I wasn't a great student; I was lazy. But when I was in sociology class, I listened.","My dad had a retail business in Leavenworth, Kansas, and there's a whole bunch of prisons there, so it was a backdrop of my childhood, these ominous prisons sitting off the road.","I've never lived in New York. I've never done a play off or on Broadway, so I think that's in my future. Have that experience - get a little apartment in the city and grow a beard and walk around with earbuds in my ears, and a stocking cap and a big giant scarf.","I'm a regular dude from Kansas who grew up with pigs and cows.","I like fresh and clean. I don't ever want anyone to smell me and say, 'Oh that guy is wearing a lot of cologne.' I want people to smell me and say, 'You smell really good!' I think there is a difference.","Right outside of Kansas City is Leavenworth, and there are, like, five prisons there. It was kind of the tapestry of my childhood. I was always fascinated. I wanted to know what was behind those walls.","Don't we all think picky eaters are a pain in the rear end? The good thing about the holidays is that it's a buffet-style thing, so you can pick what you want. It's about filling your belly, not theirs.","No, I'm not gay.","The most important thing for me as an actor playing a character is to make you laugh. That's my No. 1 goal.","Bringing up a child in a loving relationship is the most important thing.","My mom's passionate and energetic and very funny and enthusiastic.","When I was a kid, I wanted to be a clown. I didn't want to be an actor, I wanted to join the circus and entertain people.","I never thought I would be somewhat of a gay icon.","Growing up, one of my cousins was an out gay man.","TV is definitely easier hours.","People don't realize how long hours are when you're shooting a movie.","Quickly you learn it's way better to have fans talking and caring about you than not.","I sort of look at music as helping me get through situations.","I have a Tinder account. Now I've done Bumble, and I've tried this other one, and the way I justified it is that... because I'm on TV, I shouldn't be eliminated from participating in what's going on in the world. But people are always like, 'I can't believe you're on a dating app!'","I took a sociology class, and I got an A in it. Then I found out you could get an emphasis in criminal justice. I wanted to be an administrator.","I got dared to audition for a play by my best friend Paul. He got cast in 'Hamlet,' and I got cast in 'Prelude to a Kiss,' and that changed everything.","I'm always open to meeting people, but I would be lying if I didn't say that my trust issues have changed because of 'Modern Family.'","All I ever wanted to do was get a great job on a TV show. When I read 'Modern Family' and started looking at what was available - I obviously couldn't play Gloria; I couldn't play Claire. When I saw the character of Cam, I was like, 'I have to have a shot at this,' because I thought it was a character that would be really fun to play.","I'm a full-contact actor, meaning that I love to act in my toes and in my fingers, and I just try to keep it surprising.","I'm an actor in that I just want to create roles and characters and play parts that people remember and like or dislike or hate.","On an animated television series, you pretty much read the script as written. Whereas on an animated feature, you'll sometimes record the same scene multiple times over the course of a year as the filmmakers continue to tweak that part of the movie.","My job was to give 'The Secret Life of Pets' production team lots of options when it came to Duke. So that's what I always tried to do.","A lady passed me a note in Australia one time that said, 'My daughter gets bullied at school because she has two moms, and you know, we told her just to tell them to watch 'Modern Family.'","I like the Open Window Fresh WetJet scent; it smells pretty good as you are using it. I like fresh and clean smells, so it makes sense that I would also be partnered with Swiffer because that is what they are all about: making your house all fresh and clean.","Because makeup happens in my life as an actor, face wash is a key. I use La Mer cleansing gel every morning, every night, sometimes three times a day. Also, I use Bobbi Brown's Hydrating Face Tonic that you put on after you wash your face. It just rejuvenates your face. It takes away that morning face.","I like to be at a party and be a quiet observer, be in conversation. I wouldn't say I was a class clown growing up, but I would definitely sit back in class and take snipes at the teacher.","I've gone out with a couple girls in L.A. that I met on Tinder, like on real dates. It's hard to meet people.","I tell people all the time that producers, writers, and directors really don't know what they want until it walks into the room - you have to show them what they want. Everyone is rooting for you when you walk into the room. Everyone wants you to be good because it means their day is over!","I probably became an actor because of my vivid imagination, and doing voice-over really sort of takes me back to that.","I don't think guys inherently don't want to clean. I think the roles are most definitely changing, but I think in a good relationship, it's never been defined as 'a lady does this and a guy does this.' I think, in most working, healthy relationships, everybody does a little bit of everything.","I don't think I could keep my position as a well-standing man in the world if I thought there were roles for men and women.","My mom has this ugly Santa ornament, and one year, I took it off the tree and clipped it to her pillow. We've been trading it back and forth ever since - 16 years now. I wore it to the Golden Globes and even put it in her bird feeder. As the birds eat, it's slowly revealed.","I like day-after-Christmas omelets, day-after Christmas pizzas... Or you take croissant rolls, put gravy on top, turkey, mashed potatoes, cheese, more gravy. That sounds good!","Listen, re-gifting is fine as long as there is transparency. You just have to be like, 'This is something I got that I couldn't use, and I thought you might like it.'","I love cheeseburgers, really good Italian food, and really good Mexican food. I look the way I look because I've practiced a lot.","Most people don't think of actors and people like us that are performers and out in the world as introverts, but I like to know I can trust someone first.","I'm a good boy! I do what I'm told; I'm on time. I'm always where I'm supposed to be when I'm supposed to be there. I don't mess around with other people's time and schedule. And I eat my vegetables. And my meats. And my carbs. And my dairy."],"Eric Swalwell":["I support gun safety measures, and I'll tell you, I grew up in a family of gun owners and hunters, and I went hunting with my dad as a kid, and you know, I have deep respect for the Second Amendment and the culture of our country.","If you say you're going to do something, you better damn well do it.","I support an assault weapons ban, and I'll tell you why. We already have one in California, so I don't support doing anything above what we do in California.","My back's not big enough for the number of targets on it.","When I got injured, I think I was starting to sense that there was more to the world than just sports. This dream of playing professional soccer probably wasn't the best track for me.","I think having a national system that tracks who owns guns is fine. I don't think we need to be printing it on the Internet.","My position has always been that the House of Representatives does not take reservations. It's walk-in only.","The power of incumbency cannot be underestimated.","One of my goals here in Congress, being the youngest member of the California delegation, is to really try and get the institution to upgrade the way it communicates with its constituents."],"Eric Topol":["For diabetes in particular, we know there's a relationship between lack of glucose regulation and complications like blindness and kidney failure. So if you were diabetic and you knew that you could get your glucose in a tight, normal range just by adjusting your lifestyle, wouldn't that be great?","When I went to medical school, the term 'digital' applied only to rectal exams.","The digital world has been in a separate orbit from our medical cocoon, and it's time the boundaries be taken down.","Medicine is still all about treating populations, not people - one-size-fits all treatments and diagnoses.","Where today people surf the Web and check their e-mail on their cell phones, tomorrow they will be checking their vital signs.","The problem is that it takes physicians so long to accept a radical change. And the lag is unacceptable.","The ability to diagnose an imminent heart attack has long been considered the holy grail of cardiovascular medicine.","The digitization of human beings will make a parody out of 'doctor knows best.'","It's infrequent that people are rail thin yet have high blood pressure.","About half of all people don't take medications like they're supposed to.","There are certain mutations you can find across cancers in different organs.","If you sequence a cancerous tumor, you should be able to tailor the therapy according to the root cause of the cancer. But it has taken so long to do the sequencing - which also requires time to prepare the samples and interpret the deluge of data that comes out - that the patients are already undergoing therapy by the process if over.","We're all essentially surgically connected to our smartphones, and we're still in the early stages of realizing their medical potential. But they should be a real threat to the medical profession.","I use a portable pocket ultrasound device instead of a stethoscope to listen to the heart, and I share it with the patient in real time. 'Look at your valve, look at your heart-muscle strength.' So they're looking at it with me. Normally a patient is tested by an ultrasonographer who is not allowed to tell them anything.","Not only can consumers handle their personal genetic information, but they are getting genomically oriented and anchored about such data.","The U.S. government has been preoccupied with health care 'reform,' but this refers to improving access and insurance coverage and has little or nothing to do with innovation.","Our brain starts a long degenerative arc beginning around age 40.","Chemotherapy is just medieval. It's such a blunt instrument. We're going to look back on it like we do the dark ages.","Warfarin is the drug the medical community loves to hate.","For some men, the inflammation of their arteries is a result of really low good cholesterol.","For people who have heart disease, statins are great. But if all you've had is high cholesterol, what you're doing is taking this 1/100 chance of getting a benefit and offsetting it with 1/200 chance of getting diabetes.","Seeing your glucose every minute on your phone, it really changes your lifestyle. You ask yourself, 'Do I really need that piece of cake? No, because I don't want to stress out my pancreas.'","The stethoscope for listening to the heart is over. It's obsolete.","There are estimates that 2 to 3 percent of cancers in the U.S. each year are engendered by exposure to repetitive imaging.","When you're asked to have a CT scan or a nuclear scan, do you know how much radiation that involves? How many of those sorts of scans have you already had? Is it necessary? Is there an alternative? I don't think many people know about that.","I have had my genome fully sequenced and have learned a great deal about which medications I would respond to and which might or would induce major side effects, along with knowing many medical conditions for which I'm particularly susceptible.","I love information. I can never get enough. I get bored easily.","Of course, the medical profession doesn't like D.I.Y. anything."],"Eric Trump":["My father is my best friend. He's my idol and my boss. We work side by side and spend every weekend together.","I get a sparkle in my eye when we talk about redoing a property soup-to-nuts.","You see these terrorists that are flying planes into buildings, right? You see our cities getting shot up in California. You see Paris getting shot up. And then somebody complains when a terrorist gets waterboarded, which quite frankly is no different than what happens on college campuses and frat houses every day.","I've always liked sparkling wine. Rose, too.","Business, unfortunately, isn't all sunshine and lollipops.","For the Trump brand name, when we build, we want only the best buildings in the world. We travel a lot to see real estate projects worldwide, and we always study what can be done better. There's no question about it: a Trump Tower has to have the very best quality, amenities and facilities. People want that ultra-luxurious lifestyle.","Out of all my friends, I believe I'm the only kid whose dad made us work to cut rebars; we laid bricks in construction sites and did other real work every summer for minimum wage. Our dad said that it's important in the future that when we tell people to dig a hole, that you personally know how long it will take to dig that hole.","There's not a single day when I walk the streets of New York City when someone doesn't come up to me to say: 'Please, please, ask your dad to run for president.' We really need a businessman as leader of our country, not a politician.","I believe with great fortunes come great responsibility, so with our family's assets and many wealthy friends, we could help raise a lot of money to help others.","If you are running for the presidency of the United States, you better have a strong opinion.","Our father always made us work. I think that's the greatest thing a parent could ever do.","My father would be an amazing, amazing commander in chief.","There's probably people that go to Harvard and say, 'Listen, I went to Harvard. I got a great education, and I can't find a job, or I didn't become the success that I could have been.' Sure, I mean, you probably have that at every major university.","People often talk about Hispanics. You know, I have more Hispanics come up to me telling me, 'Listen, I can't wait for your father to be president. He's gonna bring jobs back to the United States. He's gonna end the nonsense. He's gonna create good trade deals. He's gonna create better education. He's gonna create a better family structure.'","People think we're only into big buildings, but iconic houses have always been the real interest. We own 11 of the world's top hotels and all the support services needed to keep them running. Trump properties have to be the best - clubs, hotels, houses.","You always have groups that want to come after the big bad developer. They don't want to see anything done. Don't disturb a blade of grass; just freeze the world in time. It validates them.","My father is an amazing guy - he's a total, total patriot... He loves America ... and he says what's on his mind... He's not like the typical politician who has to pander to everybody.","If you look at us as a company, what's the one thing that's consistent? It has to be the biggest, the best, the greatest. My father, over the years, has bought some of the best mansions of the world. It's just something he loves.","Wine is incredibly sexy.","I was at my father's office, and I'd be in the back of his office, building Lego skyscrapers, as he was negotiating million-dollar deals.","I travel probably four days a week. That's the game of international development. You have to be at your properties. No developer is successful sitting behind their desk.","Turnberry is truly one of the most spectacular properties on earth. The views, the setting, and grandeur of the hotel - there's just nothing else like it. We've respected the architectural history of the hotel first and foremost, but most of all, we've respected the tradition of golf at Turnberry."],"Eric Van Lustbader":["I can't write a scene unless I've visualized it. Unless I can actually see it, and that's why a lot of reviewers have said my books are very cinematic, because I actually do see them before I write them.","I mean, if you lined up 100 writers, you'd get 100 different ways in which they write. There's no right way or wrong way to do it; it's whatever your process is.","I do not go down and sit in front of the computer and make myself write; that's not my style."],"Eric Walters":["I always have a rough outline, but I'm shocked at how little I actually follow it. Those characters keep doing things that I never expected. I think if I crept up to my keyboard and peeked, they'd be talking about things behind my back. Okay, that's a little paranoid and delusional... but just a little.","I'm a big believer in bibliotherapy. Books have the power to change lives: what we think and what we do.","I don't chase publishers. Publishers chase me.","It doesn't matter what you have if you can't protect it.","The first time my father woke me up in the middle of the night to tell me he was going to die, I think I was eight. He brought out all his papers and explained to me what to do with his body and who to call and how to take care of things. You either learn how to survive, or you fall to pieces. I'm pretty good at surviving.","My family claims I think I'm always right, although I'm always willing to be proven wrong. I hold my opinions dearly, but you can always try to convince me differently, and if you do, I will hold that opinion dearly. I am decidedly stubborn and have been described as not having a type-A personality, but a quadruple-A personality.","My whole background as a social worker has allowed me to understand human behavior in difficult situations. Working in Kenya, I see the most desperate situations - things I could never believe possible - and then have to try to find solutions.","I wrote my first 30 books as a teacher. I would read to my classes, and they'd give me feedback. I was trying to role model.","At his heart, Shakespeare was a YA author. So many of his plays are set with high school-aged characters. He understood the passion, the confusion and drama that marks that life stage."],"Eric Wareheim":["Vests are flair for men. It's one of the few ways men can accent themselves in a formal yet fun fashion.","L.A. malls are so different than a 'mall' mall like we probably all grew up with that had a food court and the sword shop, the yo-yo kiosk.","People are rude in general.","Todd Solondz is one of my favorite directors.","There's nothing less funny than someone who looks cool. There's nothing more unappealing.","When I was 15, I wore combat boots with a fluorescent Columbia ski jacket. I was trying to find myself.","Adult Swim's philosophy is, 'Put it on the air and if it works, great. If it doesn't, take it down and try again.' It's a refreshing way to do TV, I think."],"Eric Weddle":["I'm not going to waste time or energy spent on something I can't control.","It's not a selfish desire, growing a beard, but maybe I need to not have the beard, and it'll bring us more wins.","I brush it, brush it after every practice and stuff, just because it gets tangled. It's just all natural, let it grow, let it be, let it be real.","There's a love of San Diego that I will always cherish, but this is the East. It's football - these people love rooting for the Ravens, and this gives you extra motivation in life to go get what you want.","San Diego is the best city in the world.","I usually take the first batch of some ice cream, eat it, and then about an hour later, at halftime of the Sunday night game, I go after a second serving. So I pretty much get a whole gallon of ice cream Sunday night. It's pretty bad.","I never, ever dreamed that I'd play in the NFL.","That irritates me the most - missing tackles.","I try to keep a Sabbath perspective.","I'm as loyal as anyone and will do anything for people I respect. But if you don't give that back to me in return, you're dead to me.","I want to go somewhere I have a chance to win a Super Bowl.","I've never had surgery. I don't drink. I don't go out. My shoulders, back, legs, hip, they're all fine. I think I bring a lot to a team.","I know what my body can do.","I've been to just one AFC championship game.","It honestly feels like high school or college all over again. You're comfortable; you see the game. You've seen a lot of ups and downs, a lot of good plays and bad plays. They're all in the back of your head. It's all just experience over the years. There are guys that play well as rookies, but it's hard.","I always try to remind myself, when it's tough, when your body's sore and you're hurting, I try to sit back and tell myself, 'Would you rather be doing anything else in the world at this moment?'","It's a blessing to know that the church and the gospel are the same no matter where I go. I can find a church and know the services and feel at home there.","I have noticed a difference in myself spiritually. I have had a better relationship with my wife and kids. It's because I am putting the gospel first. I just wish it hadn't taken me so long to realize it.","When I didn't go to church during my first two years in the NFL, I didn't know how it would impact me as a person. It was hard to go six or seven months without church.","Football is important, but my family and faith are also important, and no matter how good a football player I am, I knew I still needed to be a good member of the church. Having that spiritual connection helped me throughout the season. It brought balance. I felt better about myself and saw improvements in all aspects of my life.","Great night. Phelps got a gold. How sick is that.","I can sit back in 10, 15, 20 years, when I'm sitting with my kids, I'll be able to say that I'm sitting in Ravens Stadium during a game, and I'm watching one of the best swimmers ever win a Gold for the U.S. You know, as you get older, you cherish those kinds of moments.","Understanding why we are here, what we are supposed to be doing, relationships, and striving to do more other than play football - when you get understanding like that and apply it, it works wonders.","I love working with the youth. I am just as new to the gospel as lot of the kids, so I get just as much out of it as they do. Just being around them makes it one of the best callings.","I want to be appreciated, to be loved, to feel wanted.","If teams are doubting me and offering me such a small amount of money, it might not be worth moving my family.","I love the game. But I love my wife and kids more. I can't tell you how many sacrifices I make throughout the season. I leave the house at 4:15 A.M. and get home at 7 P.M. and see my kids an hour every night. It's been sacrificing for nine years. It's not just about what's best for me. It's about what's best for me and my family.","When your heart tells you something, you have to go with it.","We came from a neighborhood that was kind of older, so we didn't have that many kids that would go out and play. We moved into a neighborhood that has, like, 50 kids in it. There are 12 houses where we kind of all share a big backyard, and we're all circled in there. If one kid goes out there, they all go out and play.","Our kids are super outgoing and energetic, and they definitely don't stay in the house at all.","I want everyone to do well and to be as successful as you can. Because at the end of the day, this game is about relationships and what you make of them.","I can guarantee you this: We will be the strongest, most in-shape Ravens team that this team has ever had.","If I am running 100 yards, I should be cut. Because then I am getting beat. I do not need to be doing that. I need to be running 20, 30, 40 yards as fast as I can over and over and over at optimal energy and efficiency and speed.","For me, personally, I'm a simple guy.","The things I felt Baltimore would give me is a team that gives everything for each other and a team that wants to win and has a goal to win a Super Bowl every year.","When you think of Baltimore, you think of football. You don't think of anything else. This is what I want. I've always wanted it.","I live and breathe football.","Obviously, there is a high standard here of getting into the playoffs and having a chance at the ultimate goal, and that is the Super Bowl.","I'm a pro. I'm a professional and strive to be the best and try to have fun.","I just want to go out on a high note, go out on top, and lead my team.","I want to continue to show what I'm all about.","There's so much uncertainty within certain players and the organization.","Baltimore, it's been an amazing place and experience. It's opened my eyes a little bit just of other organizations. I'm proud to be a part of this team, proud to be part of this group of men that really challenged each other, never pointed the fingers, never turned our backs on each other.","If I don't trim the upper lip, my wife wouldn't kiss me. You have to take into account her needs as well.","Ed Reed is a legend. Ed Reed will always be the standard that, as players, we look up to and strive to be like.","I'm not Ed Reed. I'm Eric Weddle, and you're going to get a great Eric Weddle that does a lot of amazing things on the football field. And there's no pressure; pressure is self-inflicted.","I want to be great. I want to be the best.","I want to help my team win, and this is a winning organization, so there's no added pressure.","They welcomed me like I have been a Raven my whole life. It meant a lot to me. I knew what I could bring to the team, on and off the field.","I just wanted to work, build a relationship with my teammates, and earn their trust.","Going through everything in my mind, I kept waking up in the middle of the night thinking Baltimore, thinking this is my fit, this is where I want to be, and they want me.","I've played in San Diego for nine years and gone against my new team a bunch of times, and I've always envied their success. I've always envied the way they play, the way they go about business.","I went from being one of the best players, batting .550, to not being able to do it mentally, hitting .200. I thought I was mentally tough. But I couldn't hit the ball.","I've always been able to overcome things, and to this day, it still bugs me that I couldn't overcome a ball to the face. But I think things worked out for the best.","I've been the underdog my whole life.","I think I have respect from players, coaches, and certain media who watch the games. I'm not a youngster anymore.","I don't really worry or waste my energy on where I rank and this and that. I know where I'm at.","I think I'm one of the best. If you don't think that, then that's your opinion.","People didn't like me because I didn't take any garbage.","A lot of guys thought I'd bow down to them, but I wasn't like that. I was just trying to play football and do my thing.","I wanted to be the best, and I was going to outplay anyone out there. I've always been that way.","Everybody drops balls every once in awhile. I just can't let it happen."],"Eric West":["I was lucky enough to meet the Material Girl twice.","I was homeless for about 8 months, I refused to live with my dad or anyone for that matter. So I stayed somewhere that had no hot water, ever, no heat, I told myself I have to be strong and get through it on my own.","Janet Jackson is an icon, I've been honored to meet her a few times, working with her would be amazing.","Last time I spoke to my mom she called me from a pay phone, and we didn't have the best talk. Ever since my stepdad passed away three years ago, she has been very depressed and hasn't been herself at all."],"Eric Whitacre":["I don't know if it is a spiritual, physiological or psychological phenomenon, but I believe now more than ever that singing is a universal, built-in mechanism designed to cultivate empathy and compassion.","I'm not a culture snob. So while, of course, I think the Mozart 'Requiem' or, say, Beethoven's 'Ninth' are some of the greatest works of art in the history of humankind, that's not to say the Beatles or Queen or Simon and Garfunkel aren't brilliant, beautiful, important works of art that should be sung without a sense of irony.","People in chorus tends to be much more emotional or at least wear their hearts on their sleeve. They are generally the kind to hold hands and cry. It's just a different personality type.","As a composer, I know that all sorts of sounds I hear are making their way into my brain and soul and later sneak into my music.","I happen to be one of the people who believe that the Internet is a force of good, and I'm very optimistic about it.","The virtual choir would never replace live music or a real choir, but the same sort of focus and intent and esprit de corps is evident in both, and at the end of the day it seems to me a genuine artistic expression.","With vocal and choral music, first and foremost, it's the text. Not only do I need to serve the text, but the text - when I'm doing it right - acts as the perfect 'blueprint', and all the architecture is there. The poet has done the heavy lifting, so my job is to find the soul of the poem and then somehow translate that into music.","When you look back on music history, it falls into these neat periods, but of course, the period you yourself are living through seems totally scattered and chaotic.","I wouldn't say that I'm actually trying to cause chills in the audience, but certainly my goal is to, at the very least, effect a physiological response - at the most, to effect some sort of state change, ideally, in the audience.","Many composers use software to write music - programs like Finale or Sibelius. There are also recording programs. I should say I'm still very old-fashioned, I still use pencil and paper. But almost every composer I know does it the 'new way.'","I can't write music unless I'm deeply connected to it and that connection almost always comes from some experience that I have had or am having.","I'm not an atheist, but I'm not a Christian, either.","I write music that sounds complex but isn't. I frankly never think in terms of theory.","A really good poem is full of music.","For the first six or eight months at Juilliard I felt paralysed. I didn't know what I was doing.","When I had my first experiences of choral singing, the dissonance of those close harmonies was so exquisite that I would giggle or I would tear up, and I felt it in a physical way.","For me, the virtual choir has taught me that, if anything, the Internet builds these post-national tribes, people finding each other anyway they can.","There must be four or five hundred choirs here in London alone. In a way, there's nowhere else on Earth I could go and get this level and passion for singing in the one place.","I truly thought I was going to be in pop music. And then I joined a choir to meet girls, and everything changed in the first rehearsal.","I don't feel like I'm an artist with a capital 'A.'","I wanted to be a rock star. I dreamed of it, and that's all I dreamed of. To be more accurate, I wanted to be a pop star. This was in the late '80s. And mostly, I wanted to be the fifth member of Depeche Mode or Duran Duran.","To have a live choir there on the stage and then these singers from different countries signing with us in real time through Skype, it's as if there aren't borders anymore.","When I went to college at the University of Nevada back in Las Vegas, I got tricked into singing in choir. The first thing we did was the Mozart 'Requiem.' That was the piece that changed my life overnight.","I'm a self-confessed geek, and my whole concept of music at first was entirely electronic. In many ways, it turned out to be an advantage. I was so green, so utterly naive about the nature of classical music, that I did things that made me look totally, deliberately unorthodox.","Since I first fell in love with choral music when I was 18 and began composing at 21, I've been listening to these recordings of British choirs. I just fell in love with that sound - that pure, clean, pristine sound - and I think it's probably been the biggest influence on my sound.","In Las Vegas, the magnitude is impressive, but the humanity is gone. It feels like you're being intimidated out of your money instead of inviting you to come have this experience."],"Eric Williams":["Some things you'll never know, and some things you'll wish you never knew.","Once I grew from 6'1' to about 6'6', by that time I was going into 12th grade, and that's when I started wanting to play basketball, because, pretty much basketball players always got the girl.","I played baseball, and that's pretty much it. Basketball came late, this was, basketball was the sport that I tried to master, I kind of mastered baseball, so basketball was one of those things where I wanted to master this game, so that's why I probably play it the way I do.","My mental approach is totally different. My coach predicated everything on defense. He always talked about defense, defense, defense. I took it to heart that if you play defense, you can take the heart from an offensive player."],"Eric Wilson":["Even a lot of kids who are gifted can be kids who feel like wimps or nerds.","I'm aware of what kids like because I'm constantly in touch with them. Also, they say that a lot of people who write for children can remember their own childhoods vividly and I can remember my childhood very vividly."],"Eric Winter":["Within that dream of working with your partner, you want to be able to separate and have a home life. You have to be able to be husband and wife at the same time as business partners.","I was an athlete when I was younger and played a lot of sports, including golf, but I always ended up throwing around my clubs in frustration.","My parents are divorced, but they have and always are there for me. They've never missed a ball game or anything else I've done, and we've always been so close."],"Eric Zorn":["You can't buy time or save it, common idioms notwithstanding. You can only spend it.","There's no sense talking about priorities. Priorities reveal themselves. We're all transparent against the face of the clock."],"Eric-Emmanuel Schmitt":["You have to really use your imagination to refresh your daily life.","Everything in life can be tiring and tiresome if we don't have the ability to look at it as if it's the first time we've ever done it.","I find mirrors detestable; I dislike seeing myself. Of course, there's a mirror in the bathroom, but it's a magnifying one for shaving. Photographs are fine, but I don't like mirrors because they take you by surprise.","I can spend the day without writing or reading, but I can't spend a day without listening to music.","In Brussels, you are able to have a lot of appointments in a day. In Paris, you can have one, two, maybe three, but you spend all your time on the road, in the car or in the suburbs. In Brussels, everything is easy. It's not a very big city, and the people are very quiet and warm.","I really enjoy spending Sunday evenings with friends, because Sunday evenings are always frightening. You are obsessed by the fact that you are working again the next day. And sometimes you get the blues.","I am not married anymore. I hate marriage... but it's okay now.","I really enjoy spending Sunday evenings with friends, because Sunday evenings are always frightening. You are obsessed by the fact that you are working again the next day. And sometimes you get the blues. I always decide to spend it with friends. It's very nice.","When I start a book, it's every day. There is no Saturday, no Sunday. It's every day, because if I stop one day, I'm afraid of losing the book and losing the energy.","I can spend the day without writing or reading, but I can't spend a day without listening to music. I listen to music on a Walkman; it's from the 19th century, I know.","I don't like apartments - the idea of other people living, copulating and defecating above me - they make me feel as trapped as a slice of ham in a sandwich. When I was a student in Paris, I always rented attics right at the top of buildings, and as soon as I was making enough money, I bought houses.","I consider a house without books or a piano to be unfurnished.","I have some beautiful 20th-century drawings and a few paintings, but I'm not a collector, and I'm not particularly attached to objects.","Balthazar Balsan is not a self-portrait. If he was, I'd have made the character more flattering.","I wanted to become a director before I wanted to become a writer. When I was 10, people would ask me what I wanted to be when I grew up, and I said, 'Walt Disney.' I wanted to make films. But I wasn't offered a camera. I was offered language. So I started telling stories in the theatre and then in my novels."],"Erica Ash":["I love going after what I want and not stopping till I get it.","Moisture, moisture, moisture is the key to maintaining our hair. I use water-based products and try to put something on my hair every day. I pay special attention to my edges, as they are so fragile.","My natural hair is short and naturally grows to frame my face. So that's my favorite. I also like tree-braids. They're easy, fast, there's not much pulling on your hair, and they are very lightweight.","To be honest with you, the dramatic side is more fun to play because I don't get to do it as often as I get to do the comedy stuff. Most of my work in this business has been comedy, and that's sort of the way the cookie crumbles. I had not sought out to just be a comedic actor, but I think that's my default because I come from a funny family."],"Erica Cerra":["My most memorable recognition story was in Venice, Italy. My fiance and I were renting a car, and I was recognized by the person standing behind me by my voice. I thought that was hysterical!","I do really love singing. It's something that I have always liked to do.","When I grew up, my dad always used to watch 'Star Trek' and any and every sci-fi show you could imagine. I used to watch it with him, and I loved it.","I loved all fantasy, and I always thought that the ideal job as a performer and an entertainer would be to take on a mythical character, you know? Make someone up. Give them a voice, a mannerism, whatever. I always thought that that was the coolest way to do.","I love my sci-fi. I love my fantasy. Yeah! I can say it. I'm a geek. I'm a geek and I'm a proud geek!","I've always been a person who thinks it's really important to better themselves.","I know a lot of people recognize me or know me from 'Battlestar Galactica,' but I only did a couple of episodes.","I grew up in Vancouver and my father drove me to every single one of my acting lessons, auditions, and jobs."],"Erica Durance":["We all need to make time for a burger once in a while.","I've been lucky enough to do a few roles where you get to be crazy and wild, put on contacts and different wigs and different hairpieces and dresses and outfits and embody the craziness of it all.","You have to squeeze every creative moment and be grateful.","I learned to laugh at myself a little more, and I realized that beautiful things can be made out of mistakes.","Sometimes, someone you thought was your adversary is your ally.","Often we want to go back to the familiar, go back to where we felt our life pause, but nothing is ever the same.","There are a ton of medical dramas out there dealing with life and death.","I'm constantly taking my own blood pressure.","One of my goals is to educate myself more as a woman in this business.","Let's face it: Some of us need our burly men to come rescue us.","I'm learning to embrace who I am and what I look like.","It's easier to shut yourself off outside than reveal your inner thoughts.","'Smallville' was my first love and it is always close to my heart.","If you think too much about playing an icon, it will immobilize you. You have to treat it like a fresh character. Sure, there are guidelines so that you don't upset people, but you have to find your own way.","The best beauty advice I ever received is to keep skin hydrated and limit harsh exposure to the sun. If you are set on the tanned look, there are plenty of great creams that will give you a healthy-looking glow.","I maintain my inner beauty by trying to lead a balanced life in general. I try to eat healthy foods, but... that doesn't mean I won't treat myself now and then! I work out almost every day, which gives me more energy and helps me feel stronger. I also try to be a genuinely good person to the people around me.","I'm a small-town girl, and it'll never be beaten out of me.","I look forward to change, but there is a part of me that absolutely dreads it.","I might do my own independent film, that my husband wrote for me, if all the ducks are in a row.","I'm a bit of a workaholic.","Any kind of advice that I've been given to cut out carbs forever, don't do it. It just doesn't work. You do okay for a while and then you just overcarb.","I constantly have anxiety about being the lead of the show. I don't talk about it because it scares me. But I've always wanted to be part of something where I could work on a character in such a big manner, and you get offered that with all the trappings of being the lead of the show.","I'm pretty klutzy and I've always been, so I have to own up to it. It's part of my charm!","Well, I love TV, and I love a good script.","A lot of actors try to sabotage other actors, and that's sad because then you're never going to get that beautiful scene.","Actors will, in their mind, want to 'steal the scene,' and the problem is that means the scene didn't work in the first place.","I went to a tiny little high school... I'd make my foray into Calgary if I wanted to see a movie or do something crazy.","I'm fairly introverted, but when I do stuff like a Maxim shoot, there's a side of me I call Gillian.","Sometimes you revisit things and relationships, and then you get going on in it, and you realized that there is a reason this ended.","I'm a bit of a control freak, and I had to realize you can't control everything in your life.","You cannot control another human being, and you just have to learn to go with the flow and laugh at yourself, in whatever capacity.","If it scares me, it means I'm supposed to do it.","I work on most weekends, so my husband is the executive chef. He is an amazing cook. I love the way he does salmon, and his apple pie for dessert is delicious.","My home is in West Vancouver, B.C. My husband built it from drawings to design and colour.","Vancouver is a very bike-friendly city.","I sometimes take leftover food from craft services and give away a bunch of sandwiches on my way home.","What do you do when your world is falling apart? How do you hold onto the real and the rational? I think that's very relatable for people.","I read a lot of comics growing up. My mom used to say, 'Would you please read a book?' She was worried where I was going in my life.","The one thing that I really love about 'Smallville,' people are excited, and they love the characters. I can see their point of view.","I think that all actors just want to continue acting, so if you get the opportunity to go out and do something again, you feel very lucky.","I just keep looking for things that are interesting and keep calm as possible about it all, not worrying about being in a 'box.'","My worst thing that I have is that I think too much. And so it's better to go with your gut and do your best and trust the creators and the director that you have there and go scene to scene.","Thank goodness for me, 'Smallville''s Lois Lane is younger, so there's a little bit of play with the character.","In the summertime, it's always hard to introduce new series; everyone's ready for that in the fall.","It's fun to get to play a lead character that goes all the way through and drives the storyline and makes the final discovery and catches the bad guy.","I think there's something really positive about getting to explore a character for a long time on a TV show and live with that character and live with the choices they make, but it's also really great to step in.","I love TV, and I love a good script.","I constantly have anxiety about being the lead of the show. I don't talk about it because it scares me, but I've always wanted to be a part of something where I could work on a character in such a big manner, and you get offered that with all the trappings of being the lead of the show.","I think that you can't help but bring pieces of who you are. No matter what you do, it comes through you as a vessel.","I am not a particularly aggressive person. That's not Erica."],"Erica Fernandes":["The simplest of simplest things makes me happy. I love small gestures and nature in life.","My mother takes care of my health. She makes sure that the food cooked is in olive oil. She takes charge of our health also because my dad is a heart patient. So on sets, I do take care of myself. But at home, it's my mother who is the boss of our health!","My hair is quite silky and straight; however, every time I wash my hair in Hyderabad, it almost turns into a broom. The water is quite hard, and I didn't realise what the problem was until I saw another friend of mine facing a similar issue.","I am very excited, as 'Kuch Rang Pyar Ke Aise Bhi' is my first show on television, and I am thrilled about this new adventure in my career. It is an honour to be associated with such a fantastic team.","As a child, I have always wanted to have my fingers in many pies, and working on television was always on my checklist.","Being in the public eye puts you in a fix, and people are always wanting to know what you are up to.","I guess stars do not want to share anything about their personal life because then there is a question of where is the relationship going and so on and so forth.","I am never up for rain sequences because nothing can beat the excitement and thrill of natural rain.","One cannot take natural resources for granted just to entertain viewers.","After having acted in films down south, I always wanted to work on the small screen but couldn't say yes to everything that was being offered to me.","The whole saas-bahu drama is very cliched. I feel there's already too much of that on TV. So I was waiting for something like 'Kuch Rang Pyar Ke Aise Bhi.' The show offered a fresh and interesting plot.","I enjoy my work, and I take what appeals to me.","'Buguri' is a romantic film, and I play Ganesh's love interest. Initially, I had just hoped to do one Kannada film since I'm a Kannadiga. Now, I'm even learning to converse in Kannada.","After doing modeling and films, I was always keen on doing TV. It was in my to-do-list. So when 'Kuch Rang Pyar Ke Aise Bhi' happened, I was more than happy.","It's better to do one thing at a time and give your full concentration.","My sky diving experience was spectacular, to say the least. The number of safety measures and repeated cross checks make it safer. The team did not let us jump alone, as individuals are not expected to have the expertise to do so safely on their own.","I feel adventure associations in our country can be the best but somehow are lazy about getting their act together.","I've visited Mangalore as a kid because we had relatives there. But I was born and brought up in Mumbai. So I don't know much about the place or the people.","I've always wanted to model and act. My first break came to me when I was at a parlour to get a haircut. The salon owner asked me if I would model for them.","My father, Ralph Fernandes, was a model before he became an interior designer. He was very supportive of my decision to become a model and then an actress.","When I heard about how big a star Puneeth Rajkumar is, I was anxious about working with him. It was only after we began shooting that I realized how chilled-out and down-to-earth he actually is. We worked hard on the set but also had fun doing so.","Doing a film and doing a TV show are poles apart. They are two different things, cannot be compared, but I enjoy doing both, as I love what I do.","Its really important to have cooperative co-actors when you're working and specially when you are doing a daily soap."],"Erica Jong":["I think professionalism is important, and professionalism means you get paid.","It is the city of mirrors, the city of mirages, at once solid and liquid, at once air and stone.","Sexism kind of predisposes us to see men's work as more important than women's, and it is a problem, I guess, as writers, we have to change.","He who can take advice is sometimes superior to him who can give it.","Take your life in your own hands, and what happens? A terrible thing: no one to blame.","Everyone has talent. What is rare is the courage to follow the talent to the dark place where it leads.","People always think that history proceeds in a straight line. It doesn't. Social attitudes don't change in a straight line. There's always a backlash against progressive ideas.","You see a lot of smart guys with dumb women, but you hardly ever see a smart woman with a dumb guy.","Jealousy is all the fun you think they had.","Show me a woman who doesn't feel guilty and I'll show you a man.","You take your life in your own hands, and what happens? A terrible thing: no one to blame.","My generation was not only maligned in book reviews and attacked in graduate school but we lived to see our adored and adorable daughters wonder why feminism had become a dirty word.","Every country gets the circus it deserves. Spain gets bullfights. Italy the Church. America Hollywood.","The stones themselves are thick with history, and those cats that dash through the alleyways must surely be the ghosts of the famous dead in feline disguise.","Perhaps all artists were, in a sense, housewives: tenders of the earth household.","I write slowly by hand. Publishing is effectively bankrupt for you unless you are Danielle Steele. It takes a year to write book and advances are going down or disappearing.","Women's books are kind of discriminated against. If a man writes a book about his family stories, people think of it as literature. If it's a woman, she's 'spilling her guts,' and it's not art.","Advice is what we ask for when we already know the answer but wish we didn't.","Men have always detested women's gossip because they suspect the truth: their measurements are being taken and compared.","No one ever found wisdom without also being a fool. Writers, alas, have to be fools in public, while the rest of the human race can cover its tracks.","I guess the thing that I'm most proud of is that I kept on writing poetry. I understand that poetry is sort of the source of everything I do. It's the source of my creativity.","I believe that women should live for love, for motherhood and for intellect, and I believe we shouldn't have to choose. And I believe that's always been difficult for women, to express themselves intellectually, maternally, and passionately.","I think feminism means what it has always meant - women want to use all their gifts, all their talents and be judged impartially for them. I don't think feminism has ever meant anything else.","I have a very sensitive nose. I identify with dogs. I understand the world through my nose.","Ambivalence is a wonderful tune to dance to. It has a rhythm all its own.","Is a currency worth anything if no one wants it? We used to buy shoes in Italy. Remember?","Gossip is the opiate of the oppressed.","Women are the only exploited group in history to have been idealized into powerlessness.","My grandchildren are fabulous and funny.","Solitude is un-American.","Singularity shows something wrong in the mind.","If you don't risk anything, you risk even more.","I write lustily and humorously. It isn't calculated; it's the way I think. I've invented a writing style that expresses who I am.","Fame means millions of people have the wrong idea of who you are.","In a bad marriage, friends are the invisible glue. If we have enough friends, we may go on for years, intending to leave, talking about leaving - instead of actually getting up and leaving.","And the trouble is, if you don't risk anything, you risk even more.","The trouble is, if you don't risk anything, you risk even more.","I have accepted fear as a part of life - specifically the fear of change... I have gone ahead despite the pounding in the heart that says: turn back.","Men and women, women and men. It will never work.","Where is Hollywood located? Chiefly between the ears. In that part of the American brain lately vacated by God.","There is still the feeling that women's writing is a lesser class of writing, that what goes on in the nursery or the bedroom is not as important as what goes on in the battlefield, that what women know about is a less category of knowledge.","Friends love misery, in fact. Sometimes, especially if we are too lucky or too successful or too pretty, our misery is the only thing that endears us to our friends.","When I was a ten-year old bookworm and used to kiss the dust jacket pictures of authors as if they were icons, it used to amaze me that these remote people could provoke me to love.","I remember everything but forgive anyway.","I've never been able to control my public image.","I have forgotten my rave reviews and memorized my vicious ones - like most writers.","It's hard to do fiction and nonfiction simultaneously.","I never became a writer for the money. I am a poet first. Even getting published is a miracle for poets.","Poetry is what we turn to in the most emotional moments of our life - when a beloved friend dies, when a baby is born or when we fall in love.","Poetry is the language we speak in the most terrifying or ecstatic passages of our lives. But the very word poetry scares people. They think of their grade school teachers reciting 'Hiawatha' and they groan.","I don't cook. My mother didn't cook. My daughter doesn't cook.","When I met my husband, I refused to invite him home for Passover because I was embarrassed my mother might serve all the catered dishes in the wrong order.","I thought to spend my declining years writing poetry and teaching - but that won't pay the Bergdorf's bill. I think I'll move to somewhere life is cheaper.","All my forebears worked for a living. My grandfather painted portraits. My mother too. My aunt painted seascapes.","Women are not the richer sex. Women are not equal in society.","We all parent the best we can. Being human, we're ambivalent. We want perfection for our babies, but we also need sleep.","At certain historic moments, grandparents took on childrearing responsibilities. In many cultures, they still do. Chinese grandparents who are able to retire at 55 are seen all over Beijing bouncing grandbabies. In the United States, we can't afford to retire at 55.","Sadly, because of the enormous gap between rich and poor, some mothers can afford helpers, but many can't. Those who can would be kinder to refrain from criticizing other women.","Women are individuals in parenting, and why not?","When everyone thinks they know you, it's hard not to be guarded.","It was unimaginable what happens to you when you get known for a book that everybody reads, or that everybody has heard of. If the book is said to be sexy, the crazies come out of the woodwork.","Often I find that poems predict what I'm going to do later in my own writing, and often I find that poems predict my life. So I think poetry is the most intense expression of feeling that we have.","In poetry you can express almost inexpressible feelings. You can express the pain of loss, you can express love. People always turn to poetry when someone they love dies, when they fall in love.","Anybody who instantly goes from being a poet and a graduate student to being a public figure has to be in a state of shock. First people want to praise you, and then they want to attack you. No one can prepare you for it.","I'm interested in what happens to people when they get into that publicity machine. We tend to think things have changed, but there's still a deep sexism underlying the way women are treated publicly.","As a past president of the Writers Guild, I think women shouldn't write for free. Maybe you have to do it for a time, to make a reputation, but I think the idea of giving your work away is the beginning of authors not being able to make a living.","Famous people complain about fame, but they never want to give it back, myself included.","I do a lot of teaching... and so I think I know how hard it is for young writers, how they have to work two jobs to survive.","The problem with feminism in the second wave was that we fought so much among ourselves, and I think we did so much damage to the movement... and I think the next wave, the third wave, is women mentoring younger women and women helping younger women to enter the political process and the writing world.","When I'm sitting at the desk not being able to write line one, it's silence and despair! It's not so easy to put the pen to the legal pad or type the first sentence on the computer screen.","What are the sources of poetry? Love and death and the paradox of love and death. All poetry from the beginning is about Eros and Thanatos. Those are the only subjects. And how Eros and Thanatos interweave.","I think that Sappho expresses the orphaned part of ourselves. The orphaned part of ourselves that reaches out to passion for completion. That reaches out to motherhood for completion.","I don't think that I had any idea that 'Fear of Flying' would become a part of the culture. I had no idea that it would go all over the world and be published in Chinese and Serbo-Croat and so on.","Women tend to be preservers of the social structure, of marriage. They don't want to upset their husbands or their significant others. They don't want to hurt people.","Feminism is teaching. I've gotten a lot of pleasure pushing younger writers that I've met and worked with.","I don't think there's just one person for everyone. It would be very hard for me to be with a guy who was not bright or funny. And he'd have to see the absurdities of the world, not exactly as I see them necessarily.","Ken, my husband, just smelled like he belonged to me. I'm not talking about hygiene. I'm talking about when you hug him, he either feels like a member of your tribe or not. It's their scent.","I know so many women in their fifties, sixties and seventies who delight in being on their own. It's amazing. They don't see any stigma attached to it. We don't need a man to prove our identity anymore."],"Erich Auerbach":["The old man, of whom we know how he has become what he is, is more of an individual than the young man; for it is only in the course of an eventful life that men are differentiated into full individuality.","To write history is so difficult that most historians are forced to make concessions to the technique of legende."],"Erich Bergen":["My dad grew up in Pittsburgh in the '50s, and he used to sing Four Seasons songs on the stoop. He made me listen to Cousin Brucie - the guy who broke the Four Seasons on the radio. So I knew all of their songs, but I didn't know they were all by the same group.","I get tips from Bob Gaudio. And one of my songs somehow caught the attention of one of my idols, Marty Panzer, who wrote big hits for Barry Manilow. So two guys who inspired me to write lyrics are now teaching me to write.","Every bar mitzvah I ever went to was, 'Here comes 'Oh, What a Night.'","'Dawn (Go Away)' is a sad lyric, but the melody is so happy and fun.","'Jersey Boys' was a lot of running around and a lot of energy, but it was more stylized movement.","I've been performing since I was very little, about three years old. I was inspired at first by the MTV artists of the '80s and started putting on 'shows' in the apartment, most of them set to Michael Jackson's 'Bad' album. In my mind, there was a full lighting rig behind me... but it was just a couch.","I love working in television, and I've been thrilled to be a part of so many wonderful shows. I worked with Lady Gaga on 'Gossip Girl,' and the brilliant Felicity Huffman on 'Desperate Housewives,' but I think my favorite TV job so far was the pilot I shot for the CW Network this year called 'Joey Dakota.'","As an actor, when you are called upon to do a job, you are oftentimes convinced you can't do it. You say to yourself 'I don't have the talent for this; they are going to figure out I'm a fraud.' And then you watch how the others do it, and fake your confidence.","I saw my first Broadway show when I was 10 years old. I saw 'Big: The Musical' and I remember going out to dinner with my mom afterward and reading the souvenir program like crazy!","A lot of my friends were a lot into theatre a lot earlier than I was. A lot of my friends were kids who were in The Broadway Kids and the kids auditioning for Gavroche in 'Les Miz.' I was never that kid. I was weaned on Michael Jackson. Not literally, because that would have been odd.","I dropped out of high school three days into my senior year because I hated it because New York City public school is a mess. I certainly wasn't one for sitting in a classroom. Then I went off to college to North Carolina School of the Arts, then quit that after two years.","As a person, I'm just really kitchy and corny, and I love '70s variety shows."],"Erich Fromm":["Mother's love is peace. It need not be acquired, it need not be deserved.","Immature love says: 'I love you because I need you.' Mature love says 'I need you because I love you.'","Selfish persons are incapable of loving others, but they are not capable of loving themselves either.","Creativity requires the courage to let go of certainties.","Love is the only sane and satisfactory answer to the problem of human existence.","Man is the only animal for whom his own existence is a problem which he has to solve.","Greed is a bottomless pit which exhausts the person in an endless effort to satisfy the need without ever reaching satisfaction.","There is only one meaning of life: the act of living itself.","The task we must set for ourselves is not to feel secure, but to be able to tolerate insecurity.","Who will tell whether one happy moment of love or the joy of breathing or walking on a bright morning and smelling the fresh air, is not worth all the suffering and effort which life implies.","The danger of the past was that men became slaves. The danger of the future is that men may become robots.","Man's main task in life is to give birth to himself, to become what he potentially is. The most important product of his effort is his own personality.","There is perhaps no phenomenon which contains so much destructive feeling as moral indignation, which permits envy or hate to be acted out under the guise of virtue.","Just as love is an orientation which refers to all objects and is incompatible with the restriction to one object, so is reason a human faculty which must embrace the whole of the world with which man is confronted.","The quest for certainty blocks the search for meaning. Uncertainty is the very condition to impel man to unfold his powers.","There can be no real freedom without the freedom to fail.","Not he who has much is rich, but he who gives much.","We all dream; we do not understand our dreams, yet we act as if nothing strange goes on in our sleep minds, strange at least by comparison with the logical, purposeful doings of our minds when we are awake.","Most people die before they are fully born. Creativeness means to be born before one dies.","Love is often nothing but a favorable exchange between two people who get the most of what they can expect, considering their value on the personality market.","The psychic task which a person can and must set for himself is not to feel secure, but to be able to tolerate insecurity.","If a person loves only one other person and is indifferent to all others, his love is not love but a symbiotic attachment, or an enlarged egotism.","The successful revolutionary is a statesman, the unsuccessful one a criminal.","If I am what I have and if I lose what I have who then am I?","As we ascend the social ladder, viciousness wears a thicker mask.","In love the paradox occurs that two beings become one and yet remain two.","Only the person who has faith in himself is able to be faithful to others.","To die is poignantly bitter, but the idea of having to die without having lived is unbearable.","One cannot be deeply responsive to the world without being saddened very often.","Both dreams and myths are important communications from ourselves to ourselves. If we do not understand the language in which they are written, we miss a great deal of what we know and tell ourselves in those hours when we are not busy manipulating the outside world.","Sanity is only that which is within the frame of reference of conventional thought.","The capacity to be puzzled is the premise of all creation, be it in art or in science.","We live in a world of things, and our only connection with them is that we know how to manipulate or to consume them.","There is no meaning to life except the meaning man gives his life by the unfolding of his powers.","The only truly affluent are those who do not want more than they have.","Love is union with somebody, or something, outside oneself, under the condition of retaining the separateness and integrity of one's own self.","Just as modern mass production requires the standardization of commodities, so the social process requires standardization of man, and this standardization is called equality.","The mother-child relationship is paradoxical and, in a sense, tragic. It requires the most intense love on the mother's side, yet this very love must help the child grow away from the mother, and to become fully independent.","There is hardly any activity, any enterprise, which is started out with such tremendous hopes and expectations, and yet which fails so regularly, as love.","The ordinary man with extraordinary power is the chief danger for mankind - not the fiend or the sadist.","To hope means to be ready at every moment for that which is not yet born, and yet not become desperate if there is no birth in our lifetime.","Why should society feel responsible only for the education of children, and not for the education of all adults of every age?","What most people in our culture mean by being lovable is essentially a mixture between being popular and having sex appeal.","Man's biological weakness is the condition of human culture.","The most beautiful as well as the most ugly inclinations of man are not part of a fixed biologically given human nature, but result from the social process which creates man.","In the nineteenth century the problem was that God is dead. In the twentieth century the problem is that man is dead.","Authority is not a quality one person 'has', in the sense that he has property or physical qualities. Authority refers to an interpersonal relation in which one person looks upon another as somebody superior to him.","Man always dies before he is fully born."],"Erich Hoeber":["In our office, we have a whiteboard with all of our ideas and things we want to write on it - great ideas we have that we haven't had the time to get around to yet.","Not all of our work is dark, but when we are working on a dark project, we really tend to go there.","We're always attracted to characters who are people we could identify with and yet are put through incredibly tortured or difficult circumstances - the idea being that you don't really know who you are until you've been tested or suffered in some way.","We can't really make a living doing comic books, despite the fact that would be an awfully fun way to make a living."],"Erich Honecker":["Neither an ox nor a donkey is able to stop the progress of socialism.","The Wall will be standing in 50 and even in 100 years, if the reasons for it are not removed."],"Erich Leinsdorf":["When I was to come to Washington the first time as Music Director of the Boston Symphony, Mrs. Johnson phoned us to find out if they could give us a party and who we would like to meet.","When I was introduced to Johnson he was a freshman Congressman.","The President would usually talk to me about matters relating to the immigration problem.","The Congressman ascertained that the consulate in Havana had numbers to feed the pigs.","I was sent down to Cuba. Everything had been prepared with the help of Congressman Johnson and his staff.","I was introduced to Congressman Lyndon B. Johnson. The young Congressman was very friendly.","A President doesn't have a terribly long time to talk to people who are not really on the agenda."],"Erich Maria Remarque":["A hospital alone shows what war is.","On the steps is a machine-gun ready for action. The square is empty; only the streets that lead into it are jammed with people. It would be madness to go farther - the machine-gun is covering the square.","The crowd, still shouting, gives way before us. We plough our way through. Women hold their aprons over their faces and go stumbling away. A roar of fury goes up. A wounded man is being carried off.","We want to live at any price; so we cannot burden ourselves with feelings which, though they might be ornamental enough in peace-time, would be out of place here.","I am often on guard over the Russians. In the darkness one sees their forms move like stick storks, like great birds. They come close up to the wire fence and lean their faces against it. Their fingers hook round the mesh.","Anyway the war is over so far as they are concerned. But to wait for dysentery is not much of a life either.","The later it gets the more disturbed the city becomes. I go with Albert through the streets. Men are standing in groups at every corner. Rumours are flying. It is said that the military have already fired on a procession of demonstrating workers.","They are more human and more brotherly towards one another, it seems to me, than we are. But perhaps that is merely because they feel themselves to be more unfortunate than us.","Any non-commissioned officer is more of an enemy to a recruit, any schoolmaster to a pupil, then they are if they were free."],"Erich Segal":["True love comes quietly, without banners or flashing lights. If you hear bells, get your ears checked.","Love means not ever having to say you're sorry.","This isn't a watercolor, it's a mural.","I went into Harvard one way and came out a different person... It's the air at Harvard; it's like a Renaissance court.","Professors of classics - not even a professor of English - professors of classics, they're something sacred; it's almost like being a priest.","I wrote 'Yellow Submarine' for the Beatles. I wrote the screenplay for 'The Games,' about the Olympic Games. I wrote 'Love Story,' both the novel and the screenplay. I wrote 'RPM' for Stanley Kramer. Plus, I wrote two scholarly books and a 400-page translation from the Latin, and I dated June Wilkinson!","Sometimes I amaze even myself."],"Erich von Stroheim":["I am just old-fashioned enough to prefer long hair.","If I speak of Vienna it must be in the past tense, as a man speaks of a woman he has loved and who is dead.","And yet because of my attempt at sincerity I have been condemned, hooted at, reviled; filthy rumors have been circulated about me, not about my characterizations but about me personally, my private self.","For my Vienna is as different from what they call Vienna now as the quick is different from the dead.","I would like to have you quote me, Erich von Stroheim, as having said on this day of this month of this year this one thing: you Americans are living on baby food.","Since that first showing of Foolish Wives I have seemed to walk through vast crowds of people, their white American faces turned towards me in stern reproof.","I could not work with a girl who did not have a spiritual quality.","It is not because I do not love my adopted land - it is the natural feeling of one far from home, who remembers those happy, carefree days when life flowed at full tide, without responsibility, flashing past one like the drama in a fascinating story of adventure and romance.","As soon as I had seen Fay Wray and spoken with her for a few minutes, I knew I had found the right girl.","Because I select my players from a feeling that comes to me when I am with them, a certain sympathy you might call it, or a vibration that exists between us that convinces me they are right.","Fay has spirituality too, but she also has that very real sex appeal that takes hold of the hearts of men.","The picture has made its million back in four months; I have been overwhelmed by letters, hundreds of them, literally, begging me in my next production not to swing over the shallow trash of mother love, father love, sister love, brother love.","In Hollywood - in Hollywood, you're as good as your last picture.","I was reared in an atmosphere where a great deal of attention was paid to women's hairdressing.","Bobbed hair makes women look uniform. They lack individuality."],"Erik Bruhn":["If I had an extra 20 or 50 years physically, I could have been the dancer of my dreams. But I never became that dancer.","It is important, even if you performed a role the night before, to think, 'This is the first time this is going to happen.'","Dance every performance as if it were your last."],"Erik Brynjolfsson":["There are lots of examples of routine, middle-skilled jobs that involve relatively structured tasks, and those are the jobs that are being eliminated the fastest. Those kinds of jobs are easier for our friends in the artificial intelligence community to design robots to handle them. They could be software robots; they could be physical robots.","Technology has always been destroying jobs, and it has always been creating jobs.","The heart of science is measurement.","Computers get better faster than anything else ever.","Electricity is an example of a general purpose technology, like the steam engine before it. General purpose technologies drive most economic growth, because they unleash cascades of complementary innovations, like lightbulbs and, yes, factory redesign.","The kind of job where you have to hustle and hustle and where you're not sure whether you will have enough clients next month, where you have less job security, is becoming much more common.","Some people think it's a law that when productivity goes up, everybody benefits. There is no economic law that says technological progress has to benefit everybody or even most people. It's possible that productivity can go up and the economic pie gets bigger, but the majority of people don't share in that gain.","When goods are digital, they can be replicated with perfect quality at nearly zero cost, and they can be delivered almost instantaneously. Welcome to the economics of abundance.","Knowing how to keep someone motivated and how to keep a connection are skills humans have learned and evolved over hundreds of thousands of years. A robot can't figure out whether you can do one more push-up, or how to motivate you to actually do it.","Retailing has gone from an information-scarce to an information-rich environment.","Technology is not destiny.","Technology has made it easier for different firms to coordinate their activities with one another, and they don't have to be part of one company. They can get the benefits of scale without the inertia of scale.","G.D.P. is not a measure of how much value is produced for consumers. Everybody should recognize that G.D.P. is not a welfare metric.","We're rapidly entering a world where everything can be monitored and measured. But the big problem is going to be the ability of humans to use, analyze and make sense of the data.","When I first started doing work on how the Internet is affecting commerce, like a lot of people, I was really excited by this nearly perfect market.","The kind of job where you come in and work 9 to 5, and where someone tells you what to do all day is becoming scarcer and scarcer."],"Erik Erikson":["In the social jungle of human existence, there is no feeling of being alive without a sense of identity.","The more you know yourself, the more patience you have for what you see in others.","Life doesn't make any sense without interdependence. We need each other, and the sooner we learn that, the better for us all.","Children love and want to be loved and they very much prefer the joy of accomplishment to the triumph of hateful failure. Do not mistake a child for his symptom.","You see a child play, and it is so close to seeing an artist paint, for in play a child says things without uttering a word. You can see how he solves his problems. You can also see what's wrong. Young children, especially, have enormous creativity, and whatever's in them rises to the surface in free play.","There is in every child at every stage a new miracle of vigorous unfolding, which constitutes a new hope and a new responsibility for all.","Parents must not only have certain ways of guiding by prohibition and permission, they must also be able to represent to the child a deep, almost somatic conviction that there is meaning in what they are doing.","Healthy children will not fear life if their elders have integrity enough not to fear death.","You've got to learn to accept the law of life, and face the fact that we disintegrate slowly.","The way you 'take history' is also a way of 'making history.'","Every adult, whether he is a follower or a leader, a member of a mass or of an elite, was once a child. He was once small. A sense of smallness forms a substratum in his mind, ineradicably. His triumphs will be measured against this smallness; his defeats will substantiate it.","When we looked at the life cycle in our 40s, we looked to old people for wisdom. At 80, though, we look at other 80-year-olds to see who got wise and who not. Lots of old people don't get wise, but you don't get wise unless you age.","Doubt is the brother of shame.","The only thing that can save us as a species is seeing how we're not thinking about future generations in the way we live.","Men have always shown a dim knowledge of their better potentialities by paying homage to those purest leaders who taught the simplest and most inclusive rules for an undivided mankind.","I am what survives of me.","We cannot leave history entirely to nonclinical observers and to professional historians.","We are what we love.","A man's conflicts represent what he 'really' is.","Babies control and bring up their families as much as they are controlled by them; in fact the family brings up baby by being brought up by him.","Nobody likes to be found out, not even one who has made ruthless confession a part of his profession. Any autobiographer, therefore, at least between the lines, spars with his reader and potential judge.","The psychoanalytic method is essentially a historical method.","Man's true taproots are nourished in the sequence of generations, and he loses his taproots in disrupted developmental time, not in abandoned localities.","He who is ashamed would like to force the world not to look at him, not to notice his exposure. He would like to destroy the eyes of the world."],"Erik Estrada":["I never rode a motorcycle before 'CHiPs.'","I grew up in New York in an English-speaking environment.","My new passion is to get Internet education mandated in all schools. We've got to start teaching our kids how to be safe in the 40,000 plus chat rooms that are out there. Because they're being had. These sexual predators groom the kids. I know, I've arrested enough of them.","An hour of my time is a tiny price to pay for all the support I've gotten from my fans.","My grandfather taught me generosity. He sold snow cones in Harlem. I went with him at 5 and he let me hand out the change and snow cones. I learned a lot in the couple of years that we did that.","As a Latino growing up in Spanish harlem, it's not easy trying not to be hot-headed.","I do get a lot of mail. I get a lot of foreign mail because my mail gets mixed with Emilio Estevez.","I like working with an actor who doesn't do the oneupmanship. One who has no trick and gives a true, honest performance.","I really love the karate thing I did on CHIPs. I studied with a trainer because I knew we'd do episodes that had karate.","It was a hard job, but it was a lot of fun and I'll always be grateful to Ponch. He was a part of me.","They do the soaps differently in Mexico. You just have to know the storyline and not memorize the lines. There would be someone feeding you lines while you were performing.","Sergio Leone's 'Once Upon a Time in America' is a brilliant movie. It's about four hours long, but it's so well done.","This happens to a lot of kids from different backgrounds - they lose a lot of their parents' and grandparents' teachings, language and culture because they have to deal with another language and culture 24/7. By the time I was 44, I was terrible at Spanish. I was always intimidated whenever I had to speak it.","'Top Model' is pretty good, because it gives these girls an opportunity to chase their passion and possibly get a contract.","I like to watch the Fox News Network. I like 'Nightline.' I like to watch 'The Sopranos,' of course. That is one of my favorite shows. 'Entourage' is another one. I like 'The Shield.'","Oh my God... I worked with George C. Scott, way before 'Chips,' in 'The New Centurion.' I co-star in that movie. It was great working with him. I worked with Charlton Heston, Glenn Ford, Robert Mitchum. Stacy Each. The old Hollywood. I met John Wayne, and that was a thrill. I was working next door to him.","I wanted to be a New York City cop before I became an actor.","Playing a positive role on a network television show, it was great. I took it as a responsibility. Poncherello was supposed to be Poncherelli, and then when I got this part I said, 'You know what, this guy isn't going to be Italian-American, he's gonna be Hispanic American.' And they went with it.","National Geographic has awesome stuff. I like Court TV. Sometimes I'll watch Reality Mix because they have some interesting stuff on that.","Long time ago, I was going to be a New York cop, then got involved with this girl who was into acting, then got bit by the acting bug myself.","Listen, the Latin people, I love the Latin people. They are so loyal to you. Even if you haven't been on TV for thirty years, they still love you. And they cherish you and give you respect. You're not fast food in the Latin market.","I'm a deputy sheriff."],"Erik Griffin":["I look stupid without a mustache.","I think the best compliment you can receive is not, 'Oh, that was really funny,' but, 'Is that the first time you said that?' It's something that you've said a thousand times, but if somebody says to you, 'Oh my God, is that the first time you've done that?' you know that performance was where you wanted it.","When they first start doing comedy, new comics or even people that have only been doing it three or four years, they're doing an impersonation of a stand-up. This is what I think a stand-up should sound like.","It's not like every male comic you meet is funny. Like, a lot of them are not funny.","We need more female voices to come out there and do comedy.","Sometimes comedy can be, like, negative and just the worst parts of ourselves coming out.","Women are hilarious.","My inspiration to do comedy came from many places. Saturday mornings, I would watch Bob Hope and Jerry Lewis movies. I later got into watching stand-ups like Eddie Murphy, who was my main inspiration.","Most of the time, the truth is ugly and in your face! My observational brand of humor is very much all in your face!","I don't believe anything is truly off limits, but as a performer, one has to know that people might be offended, and there are consequences.","'The Ugly Truth' isn't trying to change the world with strong political opinions; it's just trying to entertain you with thoughts and ideas from my crazy mind!","I started going to the open mics every day in 2003. You make the comics laugh, they get you work, and you build up your reputation. It was a slow process.","I was born and raised in Los Angeles.","'Workaholics' seems like it's doing wonders for my career.","I love doing stand-up, and the more you do outside of stand-up to raise your profile, the better your stand-up becomes in terms of the quality of gigs.","New York is great because it's such a cross-section of the world, and when you're used to people being shoulder-to-shoulder all the time - in the street, on the train - you become a people person. People are very open to hearing a lot of different perspectives, and they aren't as sensitive.","I take the good with the bad. I always wanted to be a comic, and part of that, for me, was that I wanted to be on the road. It's a lonely existence, but it is what it is.","People don't realize it's not just about being funny, and they don't know how perceptive a comedian needs to be about human nature. You have to really be able to read a situation and peoples' emotions.","Admitted mama's boy here - put that on the record.","I'm not really a current events guy, sadly."],"Erik Hassle":["I don't always have to be on what is the newest in music is. I'm slowly educating myself in music. For me, I feel more free in not knowing everything in what I'm doing. You can start making up too many rules for yourself. It should just be love and fun and feeling good.","The first seven years of my life, me, my mom and dad and my four older siblings lived in a suburb of Stockholm, and my mom was very active with directing theater. So I basically grew up at the theater on the floors of the shows, so I was really surrounded with music at a young age.","The first time I got into the studio, when I was 17, 18, I got to work with people who were some part of the Cheiron thing, who did all the early Britney Spears stuff, all the early 'NSync stuff.","I'd love to do a live album, like a little bit old school but still progressive, influenced maybe by more electronic music. I like everything, but I don't know anything about music. So it comes in to a lot of different ingredients. I love hip hop.","Musicians were always coming and going in our house. My parents didn't play much, but they were forever arranging these parties for artists. As a result, they didn't have to play that many records.","I'm from a rural town outside of Stockholm, so in coming to L.A., I've been able to not think that much about my background. It's much easier for me in this big town, this big bubble to isolate myself from that and be a little more self-confident. I'm here to do my take on soul.","I spent 2010-2012 in Stockholm, trying to figure things out. I caught up on life! At the end of 2012, the relationship I was in ended, and I took the first plane to L.A. where my Swedish label has been setting up base. I felt so much more inspired to write and record than I had ever been, and the songs just started coming.","L.A. is such an exotic city to me, and it is just a big bubble. If you accept the bubble and accept how isolated it is. It can be a very creative place, and I find it easy to focus.","I'm a real genre jumper, but all good music belongs to the same family. I love Dave Sitek, a producer I've been working with a lot since I moved to L.A. He will change the game.","I always go in very emotionally when I'm doing music. Sad or happy, I'm always into it. I have a hard time writing for other people, writing with someone else in mind.","I was 17, still in school, and my manager saw me in school, and then we hooked up, and after that, I went straight into making music.","I was brought up with a lot of love in my family, and I've always been supported. My family has always protected me in a sort of manic way.","I stumbled into soul music at a very young age. It had something that really spoke to me.","I don't really care about a song or lyrics; I'm really just interested in the way people emphasize words. That's what makes a strong impact on me.","I grew up listening to a lot of soul music, which has probably informed the way that I sing on my tracks.","I don't know about the hair. I've had it since I was a kid, and when I look at myself in the mirror, it looks quite normal. But then when I look at myself in a photo, I realise that my hair is basically bigger than my head! There's quite a lot of interest in my hair, which is strange, as for me, it's normal!"],"Erik Hersman":["If you put enough smart people together in one space, good things happen.","Change happens at the frontier.","The future of Africa is in innovative engineering.","In the U.S. and Europe, there has been a lot of creative hobby innovation, and that's great.","The emergence of a hardware product from an African company marks a phase-change point for tech invention. The BRCK shows that great ideas can come from anywhere, that innovation comes from solving real problems with constrained resources.","I grew up in Sudan and Kenya, and lived in both the rural and urban centers of both countries throughout my life."],"Erik King":["I've played a lot of cops. In fact, my father was a cop.","If you really want to see more work that reflects your values, you have to produce it. You have to be a contributor to the business.","Don't say you want to be an actor and not know how to read a script. Don't give up 15 minutes before the miracle comes. Everyone's career ebbs and flows, especially if you're African American. That's the time to dig in and keep your instrument sharp.","I'm always curious how we sometimes have a different point of view when it comes to justice. And that's why people root for 'Dexter.'"],"Erik Larson":["Room 40 knew a U-boat was heading south to Liverpool - knew the boat's history; knew that it was now somewhere in the North Atlantic under orders to sink troop transports and any other British vessel it encountered; and knew as well that the submarine was armed with enough shells and torpedoes to sink a dozen ships.","The sinking of the Lusitania wasn't the proximal cause for the U.S. entering WWI. It was almost two years between the sinking and the war declaration, and President Wilson's request for war never mentions the Lusitania.","In hunting ideas for books, I look for stories about long-past events that once commanded the world's attention but that, for one reason or another, faded from contemporary awareness.","One of the things I've always loved is collecting telling little details.","After I finish writing a chapter, I'll print it out, cut it up into paragraphs, and cut away any transition sentences. Then I shuffle all the paragraphs and lay them out as they come. As I arrange and hold them next to each other, very quickly a natural structure for the chapter presents itself.","The Lusitania is a monument to this optimism, to the hubris of the era. I love that, because where there is hubris, there is tragedy.","In 1933, the Gestapo was founded to become - to be a secret police agency to keep tabs on political opposition and so forth. Brand-new as of April 1933.","The toilet from time to time imparted to the boat the scent of a cholera hospital and could be flushed only when the U-boat was on the surface or at shallow depths, lest the undersea pressure blow material back into the vessel.","When I'm in New York, I have, like probably everybody else in Manhattan, a white-noise generator to use at night: a Marpac Dual-Speed Dohm-DS. It is terrific. I've never slept better in the city.","Unalloyed heroes and unalloyed villains make me suspicious.","There is something about the name Berlin that evokes an image of men in hats and long coats standing under streetlamps on rainy nights.","I have found from experience that it is often interesting and useful to start from the edges and work inward - another flaw of mine. I seldom approach things directly. I would have made a great moth.","It's like being involved in a detective story, looking for that thing that nobody else has found.","I read a book called 'Transatlantic', which is a history of the great shipping lines. Also, of course, I had read about the Titanic and saw Leo drowning at the end of the 'Titanic' movie and all that stuff.","Whenever I finish a book, I start with a blank slate and never have ideas lined up.","That's what I love about history - nuance. I don't believe in unalloyed heroes. Everyone's got warts, and everyone's got a surprise side.","I'm always looking for a sign - not in a spooky, supernatural way, but in a 'neurotic writer' kind of way.","It's essentially taught in high school and college survey courses as an item on a timeline: 'The Lusitania was sunk; the U.S. gets into World War I'.","I'm often associated with parallel narratives or dual narratives. The 'Devil in the White City' was a fluke.","With my research, I really need absolute confirmation of what actually happened, direct physical connections to the past.","I wouldn't say that I'm an Italian wine connoisseur. I do like red wine. I guess my favorites now are Bordeauxes. French.","I had a nice part at big newspapers, small newspapers, and then I went to a very big newspaper - 'The Wall Street Journal.' I wrote longer pieces, and I got tired of working so hard on stories that had a shelf life of essentially one day. So then I started working on longer magazine pieces and realized then that you might as well be writing a book.","I figured, correctly, that Berlin in February was not a destination coveted by tourists. I found good airfares on Lufthansa, an airline I quite like, and got a great rate at a brand new Ritz-Carlton, which clearly hoped to seduce visitors into forsaking Hawaii for Potsdammer Platz.","As my friends will tell you, I am a superior agonizer. Believe me, you do not want me in the cockpit of an airliner. But in my defense, choosing an idea is also a high-stakes affair.","There's something so relentless and foul about Hitler and his people, and the way things progressed from year to year. It just got to me in the strangest way.","I was never concretely aware of the extent of anti-Semitism in the United States and in the upper levels of the State Department.","I thought I'd go to a bookstore and see what moved me.","I started reading the big histories and the small histories, the memoirs and so forth. At some point, I found the diary of William E. Dodd.","We, of course, have the power of hindsight in our arsenal, but people living in Berlin in that era didn't. What would that have been like as this darkness fell over Germany?","Hitler was such an anomalous character - he was so over-the-top chaotic in his approach to statesmanship, his manner and in the violence which overwhelmed the country initially. I think diplomats around the world... felt like something like that simply would not be tolerated by the people of Germany.","I pride myself on having a journalistic remove.","I like all kinds of music, though I tend to prefer jazz and classics.","I don't listen to music when I write, but I do turn on appropriate music when I read portions of my manuscripts back to myself - kind of like adding a soundtrack to help shape mood.","I'm very perverse. If someone tells me I have to read a book, I'm instantly disinclined to do so.","Reading is such a personal thing to me. I'd much rather give someone a gift certificate to a bookstore, and let that person choose his or her own books.","One of the really amazing things about the Lusitania saga was that, at the time, there existed in the admiralty a super-secret spy entity known as 'Room 40'.","In Washington, we had a grieving President Wilson, very, very much a lonely, grieving man. He had lost his wife of many years in August 1914 at about the same time the war broke out in Europe.","I didn't know anything about the Lusitania. I started reading because I had nothing else in my plate. And as soon as I start reading, I thought now this is interesting, you know, the hows of what happened, the actual - the actual sinking of the ship.","As a rule, I am very skeptical of tying books to anniversaries. I don't think readers care. I also feel that it just about guarantees that somebody else will be writing a book on the same subject, but being a former journalist, I'm always interested in, like, why write about something today? Why do it now?","Captain William Thomas Turner, hero; villain, Schwieger. As I started doing research into him and into the submarine and so forth, I found that I was growing increasingly sympathetic to him. He's a young guy, 30, handsome, well-liked by his crew, humane.","I've really tried to strip my writing of as many adjectives and adverbs as I possibly can.","I've been asked a lot lately what message is there in the Lusitania for the modern day. To be honest, not much. Except that maybe hubris and overconfidence are always dangerous things.","There's a powerful appeal in the 'I didn't know that' effect. I love it when people say, 'Gosh, I didn't know that.'","I went to public school on Long Island, and it seemed every year we were being taught that you had a right to a fair trial and a right to confront your accuser.","It troubled me that we had these reports of torture of detainees, we had people jailed at Guantanamo Bay who couldn't even talk to their lawyers and couldn't see the evidence against them - sort of fundamental bedrock civil liberties things.","I'd always been interested in maritime history, especially the great liners. I'd have done a book about the Titanic if it hadn't already been done to death by James Cameron and Celine Dion.","I do think hubris played a role here as well, the belief that the Lusitania was too big and too fast to ever be caught by any submarine, and that, in any case, no U-boat commander would think to attack the ship because to do so would violate the long-held rules governing naval warfare against merchant shipping.","To me, nuclear weapons are the secret crisis of our time. Frankly, everyone needs to reread John Hersey's 'Hiroshima.'","I started deliberately looking for characters, ideally outsiders and ideally Americans. So I just started reading widely, as I tell my students to do: read voraciously and promiscuously.","I found a book facing out that I'd always meant to read: William Shirer's 'The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich.' About a third of the way through, I suddenly, finally caught up to the fact that Shirer had been there in Berlin, from 1934 on, and was finally kicked out when the U.S. entered the war.","The SA, that is the - shorthand, those are the storm troopers. Those are the folks who are commanded by Captain Ernst Rohm.","Yes, William E. Dodd was the - became the - America's first ambassador to Nazi Germany. Prior to that, he was a professor of history at the University of Chicago - mild-mannered guy.","President Hindenburg had ultimate say over whether the government would survive or not.","Digression is my passion. I'm not kidding. I love telling the main stories, but in some ways, what I love most is using those narratives as a way of stringing together the interesting stories that people have kind of forgotten and that are kind of surprising.","Trying to find ideas is the hardest part of my job. You'd think it would be the most fun. Just sitting around reading whatever I want, going to cafes and libraries. But I always feel so unproductive. I think I was raised too well by my parents.","For 'Thunderstruck', I discarded about a dozen ideas. And then one afternoon, I was thinking about wireless. I don't know why. I guess because it's become so ubiquitous. I was thinking that maybe there's something I could do about the origin of wireless, so I did what any self-respecting person does these days: I Googled 'wireless.'","My secret weapon is my wife. She's the best judge. She's a scientist and a natural reader. We've developed a detailed code for how she marks a manuscript, and I think it's what saves me from wild digressions.","I usually look for stories with barriers to entry, something complex enough that no one else is going to do it.","My favorite zone is from 1890 -1915, that zone that spans the overlap of the so-called Gilded Age and the Progressive Era. People had such a boundless sense of optimism; They felt they could do anything they wanted to do, and they went out and tried to do it.","I've heard from the movie marketplace that James Cameron did such a killer job with 'Titanic' that it's almost impossible to do anything better.","I never recreate dialogue. I have often been asked by people, 'You must have made this up because this is dialogue, right?' Anything in my books that is in quotes comes from some kind of living historical document: a letter, a memoir, a court transcript, a newspaper interview.","Every time I sit down to reread 'War and Peace' - I've read it three times - I feel as though I've lived another life.","It was David McCullough's 'The Johnstown Flood' that lit my imagination as to how I might one day go about writing book-length nonfiction, though my favorite of his books is 'Mornings on Horseback,' about the young Teddy Roosevelt.","I don't really have a bucket list, but if I did, one entry would be to dust off my college Russian and spend a big chunk of a year reading, or trying to read, 'War and Peace' as it was meant to be read, in Russian, with all that rumbly rocks-on-rocks poetry inherent to the language.","I was a promiscuous reader. I loved Nancy Drew books and Tom Swift - never the Hardy Boys - but I also read Dumas, Dickens, Poe, Conan Doyle, and Cornelius Ryan's war books. As to favorite character: I'm torn between Nancy, on whom I had an unseemly crush, and Edmond Dantes, the Count of Monte Cristo.","It's not my intent to write definitive history. 'Dead Wake' isn't a definitive history of the sinking of the Lusitania. It's my account.","Anytime you look at someone in detail, you're putting the camera on that person. What I typically look for is one or two or three really strong characters who will hold the narrative throughout the work.","When I'm considering an idea, and there is an element of hubris involved, I generally feel comfortable that it's going to be a good story. Pride goeth before a fall. It's an element of a lot of big stories.","The reason I choose the stories I choose - and it's why it takes me so long to find ideas - is that I'm looking for that very thing. I want an idea that begins, I want a middle that is compelling and will bring readers along, and I definitely want an ending.","At first glance, the story of the Lusitania doesn't seem like the sort of thing I would take on. I usually like ideas that are a little bit more complex, things that people don't know about - or maybe they once did, but now you bring it to life for them for the first time.","The Lusitania is important, of course, because this is where Germany began its maritime campaign using this brand-new weapon. We have to appreciate how the submarine, as a weapon against civilian shipping, was a particularly novel thing - so novel that many people at the time dismissed its potential power, its potential relevance.","As a writer, you always try to imagine, 'What if I were in a situation like this? How would I react?'","I'm an early riser, for one thing. This started back when our kids were small. My wife and I would get up at 4 A.M. so that we could have a couple of peaceful hours before they woke up. That pattern has continued. I get up, make coffee, and while it's brewing, I do 50 sit-ups.","Since I loathe the tedium of gym workouts, I take breaks for tennis with my eclectic group of tennis pals.","I've met many Holocaust survivors who find the era infinitely compelling because they have this deep hunger to understand how it all could possibly have happened.","My office is tiny. I think most people would be shocked if they came to my home and saw it. It is, in fact, the former makeup room of a gorgeous local TV newscaster. I keep a neat desk. Clutter makes me anxious.","What drove me to do 'Dead Wake' was that after doing the most preliminary of reading and scoping out what kinds of materials might be available in archives and so forth, I realized that this book - the research, the writing - would present me with a rare opportunity to explore to a full extent the potential for suspense in a nonfiction work.","My goal is to produce as rich and historical an experience for the reader as I possibly can, to the point where when somebody finishes reading the book, he or she emerges from it with a sense of having lived in the past.","'The Devil in the White City' - the 'White City' was the nickname for the World's Fair of 1893, the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago.","My life! That's a long story, too. I was born in Brooklyn, New York, like half of the world, I think.","I figured I was going to apply to one journalism school and let fate take a hand.","I was in Bucks County at the 'Bucks County Currier Times,' which is a great place to start for any reporter who wants to start out.","I was once again looking for a book idea, and I remembered Holmes, but I specifically remembered that there was this World's Fair thing in the background. I thought, 'I'll read about the fair.' I had nothing better to do. I'd dismissed about a dozen ideas, and I was getting sort of antsy. I started reading, and that's where I got hooked.","The thing I always tell my writing students - I'm not a full-time instructor, by any means, but periodically I've taught writing students - what I always tell them is that the most important thing in narrative nonfiction is that you not only have to have all the research; you have to have about 100% more than you need.","I write to be read. I'm quite direct about that. I'm not writing to thrill colleagues or to impress the professors at the University of Iowa; that's not my goal.","The telephone call that forever changed the lives of the Dodd family of Chicago came at noon on Thursday, June 8, 1933, as William E. Dodd sat at his desk at the University of Chicago.","It was a civilian ship, and the Lusitania could outrun any submarine. So this population of people was very confident that Cunard and the Royal Navy would be looking after them. Why weren't they under convoy? That's the real question.","I find diplomatic histories the dullest of histories.","The one place where I do think our culture today has to be extremely careful is this whole thing about illegal aliens. Because any time you start defining a significant block of the population as 'others,' or as less than you, you start getting into dangerous waters.","How you frame a debate is very important. When you call someone an 'illegal alien,' you've already stacked the deck against them.","The Nazis hijacked the Jewish thing early on by defining it as 'the Jewish problem' and started looking for a solution. These are not just words.","I'm open to writing just about anything. I love writing the books that I write. They do tend to be on dark subjects, but I don't think of myself necessarily as a dark-humored person. I like having a lot of fun.","I think, one day, I might actually try writing a bunch of - a collection of essays maybe on the funnier side of the spectrum. I don't know. But it's fun to have, frankly, Twitter as kind of an outlet. When you're writing about dark things all day, it's kind of fun to have fun.","Isaac Cline was a creature of his times. He embodied the hubris of his times and, in many ways, was a victim of the storm, not just in material ways - loss of a family member and damage to the town - but also in metaphoric terms.","The head of the hurricane research division, Hugh Willoughby, told me that hurricanologists can predict the behavior of storms if those storms behave predictably.","What is clear is that in 1900, Galveston was growing fast, had already become the number one cotton port on the Gulf Coast, and was already being referred to as 'the New York of the Gulf.'","In 1900, 45 steamship lines served Galveston. Twenty-six foreign governments had consulates there. The storm damaged its reputation as a safe place for substantial investment by railroads then seeking to dominate various trans-continental routes.","The most painstaking phase comes when the manuscript is set in 'type' for the first time and the first proofs of the book are printed. These initial copies are called first-pass proofs or galleys.","One question that often comes up is why, in this age of blogs and tweets and instant digital communication of all kinds, it still takes so long to publish a book.","The writer marks the changes he wants to make, while a proofreader also goes through the galley, checking it page-by-page against the manuscript. Once all these changes are identified, a second-pass proof is made, and this, too, gets sent to the author and the proofreader, and the process begins anew.","I knew Berlin would have to become a kind of character in my new book, 'In the Garden of Beasts'. I had felt likewise about Chicago when I wrote 'The Devil in the White City' and Galveston with 'Isaac's Storm'.","A writer could spend years reading already-published books just to gain a grasp of the historical terrain.","I knew from an online search that the Wisconsin State Historical Society, on the vast University of Wisconsin campus, held the papers of Sigrid Schultz, a spunky correspondent for the 'Chicago Tribune' who became one of Martha Dodd's friends in Berlin.","At some point, I stumbled across my two main protagonists: William E. Dodd, a mild-mannered professor of history picked by Roosevelt to be America's first ambassador to Nazi Germany, and Dodd's comely and rather wild daughter, Martha, who at first was enthralled with the so-called Nazi revolution.","If I'd been living in Berlin in 1933-34, could I possibly have foreseen the Holocaust and all the corollary horrors of World War II? And if I had, would I have done anything about it? I also started to wonder: how does a culture slip its moorings?","I envy other writers who claim to have a backlog of books they'd like to write.","There is no secret orchard where ideas grow. Oh my, do I wish there were.","At some point in the idea process, I simply wear myself down and force myself to choose. But here's the thing: Once I do choose, suddenly all the other possibilities wither and die, and thus I never have a backlog of well-formed ideas waiting for me when my latest book gets finished.","A very important part of my workday are the two Nunzillas on my windowsill. They keep me constant company. They're little windup toys, and when they move across the desk, they spark from the mouth. I think of them as my editors. They sort of remind you that the world can be a silly place.","When I'm interviewing somebody, I take notes with a Bic Cristal, the classic black-cap, clear-body, medium-weight pen. It works on many levels: You can chew the cap, and if you're really bored, you can bite the end off the back."],"Erik Paulsen":["There is no question we need an energy policy overhaul in America. A key part of that overhaul must include moving forward aggressively with expanding nuclear energy as a renewable energy source. Storing nuclear waste is an important piece of that effort.","Any law can be changed, obviously, at any time.","I just want to listen and build relationships with as many of my colleagues as possible.","Minnesotans are ticket splitters. They look to the candidate, not the party, which is the way it should be, and that's only going to help me.","That's been hard being away from the family, because Washington can be lonely. When you tune out of all the activity, that's like, you're alone.","College campuses are a focus of prevention efforts for meningococcal disease because of the increased incidence of the disease during adolescence and young adulthood, as well as transmission from crowded living conditions and social behaviors common among college students.","We need a tax code that promotes savings, investment, achievement, innovation, and hard work.","Spending more time with my colleagues outside the Capitol helps build bipartisan relationships.","The medical device tax repeal is the only proposal that had the most bipartisan votes coming out of the House and has the opportunity in the Senate to gain tractions, and it fixes a part of ObamaCare in terms of repealing an awful tax. And it's got bipartisan support.","I'm not a supporter of ObamaCare. I voted to repeal it, to defund it, et cetera. But we do need to move on.","After thinking carefully about how I can best help my fellow Minnesotans, I have decided to not seek election for a different office in 2014. The warm encouragement from many people to run for U.S. senator or the governorship was deeply humbling.","The bottom line is we need a tax code that is more simpler, that is more fairer, that gets rid of the special carve-outs, the special lobbyist loopholes. That's the direction we need to go.","I've criticized Republicans for their lack of fiscal discipline when they controlled Congress before 2007. However, that is no excuse to just continue with more of the same or, as the case is now, to make it worse. Under House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's budget, we will double the national debt in five years and triple it in 10.","As Congress debates overhauling the nation's health care system, it should not authorize a reform plan that would further our financial woes. We must avoid creating an unsustainable government program. There is no question that reform is needed, but health care can be made more affordable without massive and expensive new bureaucracies.","Since I joined Congress, I've been shocked at how many times we were forced to vote on 1,000-plus-page bills without ample time to read or review what was in the final legislation. It's no wonder Congress doesn't enact good policy.","Our democracy is predicated on the belief that our government should be accessible by the people. We cannot allow ourselves to give in to fear or shy away from interacting with the public."],"Erik Per Sullivan":["When I was little, I wanted to be a spy or a monster truck driver. Later, I just thought movies would be, like, a good hobby or something.","Karate is good for teaching you to do what you're supposed to do.","My mother wears glasses, and so do some of my friends. When they get new ones, the old glasses go in a drawer.","I went to karate for about four years, and I learned a lot about focus and listening very good.","I just want to be a normal kid like all my friends. I like acting. I might want to be an actor for a long time. But I still want to be able to see my friends and that kind of stuff."],"Erik Qualman":["You can spend your time daydreaming or make use of it in other ways.","It had not yet been named Silicon Valley, but you had the defense industry, you had Hewlett-Packard. But you also had the counter-culture, the Bay Area. That entire brew came together in Steve Jobs.","The power of social media is it forces necessary change.","You're talking about a younger generation, Generation Y, whose interpersonal communication skills are different from Generation X. The younger generation is more comfortable saying something through a digital mechanism than even face to face.","Social media has made the web all about me, me, me.","As social media is less about technology and more about relationship building, we are starting to see more women have a heavy influence if not dominant role in the social media space. It's no wonder that Facebook is being run in part by chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg.","The easier things are to buy, the more we consume.","Increasingly, consumers don't search for products and services. Rather, services come to their attention via social media.","Language is always evolving. It's difficult to read Shakespeare now because language has shifted. Similarly, kids these days can get to the point really quick in about 140 characters or less because of these new tools.","That's the power behind a tool like Facebook Connect. It is making a Web without walls. Facebook allows you to go to other sites to comment, rate, etc., without having to set up a new profile for that site.","Best results are often achieved well before you need a job, by consistently networking so that when you find yourself job-hunting you have a large network to work with.","Everybody's got the mindset that everything should be measurable.","With the growing reliance on social media, we no longer search for news, or the products and services we wish to buy. Instead they are being pushed to us by friends, acquaintances and business colleagues.","At a minimum the majority of search dollars will flow to a social media model because people care most about what their peers think and the technology is there for that information to be quickly shared on products and services.","One thing we seem to be missing is that just as we no longer search for the news, the news finds us today (e.g. this article found me) we will no longer search for products and services, rather we will look to our social graph to what products and services they like and don't like.","It's about listening first, then selling.","Folks want to be listened to, they want to be heard.","Twenty-five percent of search results for the world's top 20 largest brands are links to user generated content and thirty-four percent of bloggers post opinions about products and brands."],"Erik Satie":["When I was young, I was told: 'You'll see, when you're fifty.' I am fifty and I haven't seen a thing.","The musician is perhaps the most modest of animals, but he is also the proudest. It is he who invented the sublime art of ruining poetry."],"Erik Voorhees":["Bitcoin is absolutely the Wild West of finance, and thank goodness. It represents a whole legion of adventurers and entrepreneurs, of risk takers, inventors, and problem solvers. It is the frontier. Huge amounts of wealth will be created and destroyed as this new landscape is mapped out.","Whenever the price of cryptocurrency is rallying, people start spending a lot more.","I'm much more confident with crypto than with banks or fiat currency because I can actually control it, and the money supply is transparent, stated up front. It makes online shopping a lot easier and a lot safer.","Like the Internet, Bitcoin will change the way people interact and do business around the world.","I have no problem with the financial industry inviting the Trojan Horse of blockchain technology into their walled garden. Because I know how powerful the technology is.","If you see a market that has slow and steady growth long enough, you'll start to front-run it, and that slow and steady growth will start turning into steeper growth, and that will accelerate the process.","Bitcoin is open-source, global, and requires no permission from anybody, so thousands of entrepreneurs are gravitating in and building their vision.","Digital currency is now a misnomer for Bitcoin. It can be used as currency, but it can be used for many things.","Most 'digital currencies' are not really digital currencies at all.","Bitcoin is very ideologically fulfilling, it's my form of political activism, but it's also a huge business opportunity.","Personally, I had over 550 BTC in Gox. I will never get any of that back.","Unfortunately, slow and steady in any financial market is actually impossible.","You cannot have an asset that goes up in price 1% every month or 1% every six months or every day without people starting to start thinking it'll do the same tomorrow, so that's why these bubbles form.","In the longterm for Bitcoin, Gox needed to go away.","The Dwolla incident was to be expected. The government will go after sites that it thinks are supposed to register as money transmitters. Some Bitcoin companies will register as such, and some won't, but business will carry on regardless.","The big exchanges that hold customer deposits are a big target for hackers, and unfortunately, most bitcoin exchanges store user funds.","Credits in your PayPal account are really just USD-backed - they are not a unique currency themselves. Other 'digital currencies,' such as Facebook Credits, can be created out of nothing and without limit, so they are not serious money.","Bitcoin is two things which share a name. One, it's a payment system, and two, it's a currency. You use the Bitcoin payment system to send bitcoins as currency from one account holder to another. The transfer is instantaneous, carries no fee, works anywhere in the world, and is private.","Mt. Gox was a teachable moment for everyone in the Bitcoin community, and ShapeShift has innovated these problems out of the picture.","I was very excited about a currency that was not controlled by a central government, that could be a free market currency. That was all the incentive I needed to dedicate my life to it.","Bitcoin will hit thousands of dollars per coin, because it's worth at least that much, or it's worth zero.","The number of industries, communities, habits, traditions, and even interpersonal interactions that Bitcoin has the potential to revolutionize is massive.","The value of Bitcoin is astronomical, but the price goes all over the place as a million buyers and sellers try to figure out what that value is and how likely it is to manifest.","When we started ShapeShift, a future world of natively digital assets was very theoretical.","Cryptocurrencies allowed non-custodial exchange, without users having to sign up or create accounts.","ShapeShift, like SatoshiDICE before it, demonstrated how an old business could operate in a brand new way because of the properties of cryptocurrencies.","ShapeShift has no user accounts, signup, or registration process whatsoever. But it's faster and far more convenient than traditional exchanges."],"Erik von Detten":["In a girl I look for honesty above all, someone who I can carry on a conversation with, someone who has a good sense of humor, someone who's true to herself, and to top it, someone who can get ready for a date in less than ten minutes."],"Erika Christensen":["I think part of the beauty of our relationship with jewelry is that it can change and evolve as we do ourselves.","I take things on a day to day basis when it gets really hectic. But I do think long term and I'm looking forward to the next couple of years when I do start producing my own films with my production company and playing some characters that are older and that's really exciting to me.","Sometimes, I get so annoyed when other people brag. And sometimes, I know that I'm better than that or I've got something better in the works; I don't say anything. I just say, 'Really? That's great.'","There was a little of this, 'Oh, you're such a sweet girl!' That's a wonderful thing to have in life; I don't mind it at all for life. But I remember, the first role I was ever cast in as a not-so-sweet-girl, I was so happy.","I'm not straight up and down. I have curves.","At the premiere for 'Leave It to Beaver,' I was walking down the red carpet, and they were screaming my name, and I'm wondering, 'What do I do?' So I had to think, 'OK, calm down, one person at a time.' Everything is kind of rattling, but afterwards, my publicist said I did really good.","My buddy lost about 100 pounds cycling. He took me on a 31-mile loop. I was hooked.","Having convenience when it comes to fueling your body is definitely an important thing.","There are photos of me with my Pony trucker hat, sideways. Truly, awesomely, horrible.","I'll continue doing good projects.","I can't say enough about how I'm against drugs. Be smart, think about it, look at what it does to people, look at how much you have to experience in life and be courageous enough to do everything you want to without that chemical help.","I've always been a good flier. I love the whole experience.","My grandmother was, back when they called them 'stewardesses,' a flight attendant. I actually had a ball wearing that little uniform and making sure everything was under control.","The thing about that too is that we had the same extras everyday. It was such a community. It was like a microcosmic little town. We were like all little towns people with extras and a crew.","Watching Jodie on this is incredible; it's the perfect role for her. It's so intense and so emotional. She just jumped right into it and is so professional.","We were worried about that actually. The cast was thinking that they'd lose their minds. But we didn't.","I'm more proud of my upper body. Let's just say I'm a typical female in that way.","I don't know if my agent will be upset but I quoted him saying that he would jump out a window if I turn down another project.","To be entirely honest, I am an extremely confident person, and I don't think I would have gotten into this business if I felt that I wasn't going to succeed and I intend to be in this business, for the rest of my life.","At about twelve I just knew, something clicked, and I knew I wanted to be an actor and my parents, to their credit, granted this 12 year old girl a chance to give it a try.","I'm a goody two-shoes who's never taken anything stronger than Tylenol.","If I had to sum it up, the goal of Scientology is giving the person back to themselves. Like, your own power of choice.","I got to work with Jeffrey Wright, which is fantastic. I started out starstruck, but he's so cool, so it was all OK.","I think that's just a natural instinct as an actor is that you want to just keep exploring humanity and finding different facets of it.","There are nearly 7 billion people on this planet, so there are a lot of characters to play.","When I first started going on the red carpet, I wore a lot of Armani, but I didn't really have my own style apart from that. I think I was just lazy.","I went through this rebel period where I didn't want to dress up.","I know lots of people who eat raw, vegetarian, or vegan. I'm not into any of those things. I believe in eating enough so your body will actually run.","My grandmother was a flight attendant; my mother had a pilot's license, and my grandfather was a pilot. That's how my grandmother and grandfather met.","I've found that a lot of my male friends have great style and great appreciation for designers.","I have so many pairs of riding pants that are from the store at the stables in Burbank where you can go ride your horse at. I don't ride a horse, but I do wear the pants! I love them!","As a little girl, I really hated pink, for instance, and I didn't like wearing dresses. I didn't want to be a girly girl then, but now I love being a girly girl!","For the first six years of my career, I was relegated to those girl-next-door, sweet, cheerleader kind of roles, and it was really frustrating for me because you don't have to do much acting.","I don't want to shut the door and only be thought of as the dark girl.","There's no one who has more authority over my life than me. And I can learn things myself and how to communicate to other people and how to apply with the rules of life.","There's a lot in Scientology that develops confidence because there is peace, I think, that I've gotten just to know that what I do know, I do know.","I can change my mind and can learn other things. And anything I don't know, I'm capable of learning if I so desire or if it's necessary.","I tend to be a fan of darker shows and love 'The Americans,' 'Ray Donovan,' 'True Detective,' 'House of Cards' and 'Peaky Blinders.'","Jason Katims is fantastic.","Working with a kid is just so interesting to see.","You can't have a relationship at all if you don't trust each other.","I was going to school with a girl who was an actor. And I was, like, 'No, I want to be an actor.'","I told my parents I wanted an agent, and they decided to let me have a go at it. Then I started working right away. I was 12.","After 'Traffic,' I was a total homebody. I was still a kid.","It was when I met everybody on 'The Perfect Score' that, like, nightclubs became a thing.","The SAT is not particularly relevant to my life.","Making a movie is a little bit like high school. Because everybody lives together, and you see each other every day, and word travels fast around there.","I cheated once on a spelling test. I didn't know how to spell period. I leaned over the desk and looked at someone else's paper. I was probably ten or something like that.","I want to do a love story. I really want to do a love story.","I wrote and recorded a song that I highly doubt I will release. The lyrics are somewhat risque. I may have to create an alter ego, and she can be the 'singer.'","Erinn Hayes is hysterical in person, and I love that.","I had fallen in love with doing television.","Number one, as an audience member, I tend to like violent movies and TV shows because it's not real.","Work hard; be ethical.","There are times when I think, 'I'm going to get this part. I know I am. I'm going to get this.' And then I don't, and I'm wondering, 'What happened? I went back five times!'","My first thing was a McDonald's commercial.","I know I am eventually going to want to write or produce.","If I can't find anything good, I am just going to have to get my butt in gear and start learning how to do everything.","I didn't plan on going to college, at least not a full-time schedule. I still have that plan. I may take some individual classes at some point as an indulgence.","Those auditions - you sit down, and literally the whole time you're there, they scrutinize you, and you know that. But you can't take it personally.","I love to dance and sing.","I want to do an action movie where they say, 'Go the gym and get ripped like Linda Hamilton.'","My bike is my main form of transportation, so I've got a red clip-on taillight.","Growing up, I was a bit of a tomboy; feminine things took a while to find their place in my world. But diamonds made me understand the magic and beauty of jewelry.","Green has always been my mom's favorite color. My father, aunt and I have gotten her jade, emerald, and peridot pieces over the years, and we always seem to be on the lookout.","Scientology helps me in acting to focus on communication.","I look like a sweet, corn-fed kid. My roles are my rebellion.","Love scenes feel very mechanical. But our whole job is to make it look real.","I don't have a 'Life's short, play hard' type of philosophy. That's about fear. I tend to think that life is very long - but you should still play hard.","I love 'Lost' and 'Mission: Impossible III.'","I'm close with my whole family, but it requires email and texting because they don't all live nearby!","I can be a binger when it comes to information, but most of the time, I'm pretty good, and I try to focus on my own life and personal communication.","If being a skateboarder were a personality type and not actually an athletic activity, then I'd say I'm a skateboarder. But I don't ride one. I'm a bicycle person.","I'm an NPR and KCRW person.","I had a big 'New York Times' crossword puzzle phase.","When a woman makes up her mind, she gets what she wants.","My theory is, if you force yourself to smile enough, then you start to feel it. Which comes in handy all the time.","I love the idea of my daughter looking back at her childhood and growing up with a dog.","It's funny to say its fun to explore someone's really rough time, but it is. It's exciting.","'Confirmation' is the movie I'm super proud to be a part of."],"Erika Eleniak":["He is in a gunfight right now. I'm gonna have to take a message.","I didn't have a pool growing up, and we went to the beach to lay out and get sun.","I liked acting early on, and I really liked roles that were meaningful to me, and 'Baywatch' was.","An actor is like a piece of clay: you just keep moulding me. Even people who work with you every day want to put you in a little box.","I love my life. I'm really grateful. My biggest dream come true is my daughter. I've wanted her since I was a little girl."],"Erika Slezak":["Jean's whole job is to protect Victoria. Jean is a very practical, very orderly, very disciplined person; she is the personality called the gatekeeper.","And I'm hoping that over the next 20, 50 years, whatever, the mystique of television and film and all that will diminish somewhat, and people will leave us alone to get on with our jobs.","And at five o'clock in the morning we left to drive to Old Tucson, and I sat with my mouth open in the van. I was stunned by the beauty of that country.","Brian really kicked back on his own when Amanda was a baby. We had a long talk about it, and he was spending a lot of time in California working there and he didn't really want to spend all his time out there and have his children and his wife on the East Coast.","But also, it's a wonderful thing for children to see the birthing of puppies, to see nature at its best when it works and to have the experience of the puppies.","Daytime has been successful all these years because it caters to a very real need in the audience - to see something that's not nighttime fantasy. People watch daytime because it's like their lives.","Fame an fortune are nothing if you're not happy and healthy.","I have this personal affinity for the desert. I am fascinated by the desert. I love it.","I haven't been on the stage in a long time.","I mean, I don't necessarily want to leave because I have this job, but I would love to do a good play.","I might be doing a lot more theater, which is kind of what I love, but there's simply no time for.","I think it's a mother's dream come true to see it work out that way. Not just the mother, but certainly parents, to know that their children have a very solid moral foundation and religious foundation.","I was actually very pleased that they let me do it, because I feel very deeply for breast cancer survivors. I don't have it, but it is in my family. I've always been very aware of it. I go for mammograms and checkups.","I've obviously made a very nice amount of money. I have a very nice lifestyle. I get to do what I love. Very few actors get to do that, and even fewer are lucky enough to work steadily for 24 years.","If you have ever been in a real tragic or sad situation, the words that come out are hopelessly inadequate and kind of cliched.","My daughter is a freshman in college and my son is - well, our daughter and our son - is a sophomore in college. So they come home on selected weekends, they come home on vacations and they're home in the summer, although they have jobs.","My husband gave up all his work to stay at home with the kids, and we split all the duties at home. I do all the boring stuff - like pay the bills, and he does all the exercising for both of us, which I'm very grateful for... I thank him for it regularly.","My parents had a wonderful marriage, but it was a very dependent relationship. My mother was entirely dependent on my father because that's how it was in those days.","Oh, God, I would love to go and do a play someplace.","The worst storyline I've ever been involved in I wasn't involved in, because I was clever enough to get pregnant with my second child and they wrote me out and they replaced me with Christine Jones. And thank God - that was the worst storyline.","There are lots of people in the world who do have the advantage of going to a good drama school and just decide that they want to be actors. There's nothing wrong with an untrained actor; they have to get their training somehow, they have to learn.","Very few people run around and get amnesia and have comas and come out of them and do all the silly of people have strokes and have comas and come out of them and do all the silly things we do on soaps.","We owned a bearded collie for many years. Sophie. She was old, and she died last year.","You know, if you think about it, the most powerful people on this earth probably never raise their voices - they just say it and people hop to, because they have that power."],"Erin Andrews":["Obviously as I'm getting older, I'm seeing changes in my body that I may not like... but I do love food, and I'm from the South. I'm not gonna lie, I eat fried chicken, I love macaroni and cheese, and I love grits.","I think what I try to do with all the naysayers, negative comments, or even people that think you can't do it, I'm trying very hard to use it as motivation and to add to that chip on my shoulder.","I don't cheer for anyone because my job is obviously more important, but the reason why I got into sports is because of my father. He's a giant sports fan and we are from New England, so he cheered for the Celtics and the Red Sox.","Despite what I do for a living, I am very insecure about my body.","Being a woman in a male-dominated industry, you are so afraid of people thinking you are weak.","I'm somebody that has a very big competitive edge and a chip on my shoulder.","I try to stay in shape just to handle things like the stress of a job or everyday life.","Yes, I am an Irish lass through and through.","My mom is an art teacher and is very much into the performing arts. What can I say? She is the female in my life and has guided me on how to act and conduct myself. A lot of my strength comes from her.","My dad used to call me 'the human pretzel' because I was able to bend my body, and because my legs are very long.","I always second-guess what I am doing.","Tim Tebow cannot dance, I know that.

And the sooner you realize that, you accept that, and integrate that into your work ethic, you will start being successful. As long as you blame others for the reason you aren't where you want to be, you will always be a failure.","I do hear about these actors who go on vacations to Bali for three months, and their agents are banging their heads against a wall trying to find their clients - but that's not me. I'm working hard every day. Enjoy your vacation.","Almost all of my jobs have been on locations. And I think you can be that person who says, 'I have a job that forces me to travel and I'm just going to go ahead and do it and pray for my next flight home.' Or 'this is where I am, this is my life, let me see a part of this world I now live in.'","My cell phone bill and my cable gets cut off all the time. Not because I don't have the money, but because I just forget to pay my bills.","I think it's true for men and for women, if you are even remotely attractive, people will assume you're just another pretty face and you don't have the work ethic or the talent to put in the time to flesh out a career.","When I thought about Detroit, I would think big city, very urban - not a lot of places to walk around, not a lot of parks. I sort of pictured Manhattan almost, where, besides Central Park, it's all city and big buildings. But now that I'm here, you see people pushing strollers, people hanging out in the park.","A lot of the characters I end up playing have a certain degree of glamour or sexiness, but I like it when you can have some other element that makes it much more interesting.","My goal was never to be famous, but to be a consistently working actor.","I am a Cajun Baby in a Texas girl, an all-American woman and a global goddess.","All four of my grandparents were educators, my mom was a school nurse, and I went through the public school system.","I can read in any book and newspaper about the city of Detroit, but I want to hear what the people in Detroit have to say about Detroit. My best education is actually talking to people."],"Erin Daniels":["I love a good steak with a great glass of red wine. But for the TV watching, laying around doing nothing kinds of days, nothing beats a pepperoni pizza and chocolate Haagen Daas.","I don't pick roles based on how famous they are going to make me; I pick roles based on how they're going to inspire me intellectually."],"Erin Duffy":["The truth is, I can't help the way people perceive anything, from the role of financial industry in the economic crisis, to the place of women's fiction in the canon of modern literature, to the rank of mint chocolate chip ice cream as a favorite Baskin-Robbins flavor.","I like a good fun chick-lit book as much as I like historical fiction, mysteries, or biographies, I like to be well-rounded!","It's hard to listen to the news every day and have everyone saying you're the Antichrist.","It seemed glamorous when I used to go into work and get to be on a trading floor or see how the business worked a little bit before I ever understood what it was.","When I left Merrill Lynch, one of the things that upset me the most wasn't losing my job. It was not being able to see those people the following day. It was almost like divorcing 40 people.","I think any time you have a workplace that's heavily weighted to men just by the nature of what it is, the same way you can say PR or fashion is heavily occupied by women, there's always going to be a little bit of that sexism.","When you have a couple hundred people in one huge space, that's gonna lead to jokes and it's a breeding ground for practical jokes and teasing.","No one wants to read a math book.","No one is reading my diary, that's for sure."],"Erin Foster":["Your sister knows everything to say to piss you off. But sisters tend to be each other's biggest champion and also their hardest critics.","I have no college education; I taught myself how to write. If you want it badly enough, you can have it. You can walk into any room and convince the person that you know what you're doing.","You don't get to be in the squad unless you're six feet tall, a supermodel, perfect, famous, and hot. That's like hand selecting perfection, putting it into a group of girls, and saying, 'Look how amazing we are.'","The greatest thing about siblings is you constantly have someone putting you in check; there's no room to get delusional about yourself.","The Bachelor'... and 'The Bachelorette'... and 'Bachelor in Paradise'... and the 'After the Final Rose ceremony'. I love a competition dating show.","I have run from a lot of relationships in favor of being alone. And I tend to find men who use their money and status as a dating tool to be unattractive.","No one wants everyone to know how sick they are and everyone to see how much they are struggling. And when that seems to be the focus, of making sure everyone sees how sick you are, that's just confusing to someone that is trying to be supportive.","The idea of me writing something that I'd get to be in as well was not what I saw coming. I do think that life works that way. When you kind of let go of something and accept that it hasn't worked, it takes all the pressure off, and then you end up getting it.","Our dad was always like, 'Look, if you're musical, if you live and breathe music and want to play an instrument, that's not something that's on me to put on you. If you're passionate, you will come to my studio every day after school and watch me work because you can't live without it.","What's happening with feminism in general is I think that, as a woman, you're not limited to being one thing or the other. You can be feminine and sexy and beautiful and hot and funny.","Obviously, it's the Lucille Balls of the world who helped make humor accessible to women and in a voice that women related to. I just wanted to continue that.","We're living in a time when the most famous people in the world have no specific skill set and are known for living their lives in front of the world. How strange is that? The appeal makes sense to me - it's like 'The Truman Show,' getting a chance to peak into someone's bedroom or see the way someone fights with their husband.","Fashion is really funny because it's something that should be subjective, but there are clear things that are chic or not chic. There are all these rules, but if the right person breaks a rule, then it becomes a trend.","I love a dinner, but I love a night in.","I'm kind of over people using the word 'bae'. Let's get rid of that.","I love animals. I just don't want to have a pet. That's OK, right? I would take a dog over a cat, at least to interact with you. I feel like cats just stare you down all the time. Cats have, like, bad attitudes.","There were a lot of assumptions that we were raised a certain way. Our dad was always really clear with us that he is rich and we are not: 'If you want to be rich, you should go do what I did, which is work really hard.'","Our parents are beyond proud that we never sold out once and created something together.","I don't think we are changing the world here, but we might be influencing a perspective.","When I did stand-up at U.C.B., and I had a blog for a couple of years that started my writing career, 'Totally Confident and Completely Insecure,' it was the same kind of self-deprecating humor and stories about being out in L.A. and being treated like a loser at a hair salon because you are not famous.","People want to see someone who looks like they might have this enviable life, but in turn, they are a mess and their life is a mess.","We have really good parents, and even though they broke up when we were little, we were still raised by two people who had really good ethics. They were never going to let us turn into Paris Hilton. I think that it wasn't really an option to become spoiled brats.","I don't even know who I am. All I know is that I am the sibling, daughter, sister, the friend of somebody, and I need to know who I am outside of that.","When you have a big family, certainly with strong personalities, you feel like you have to fall into a role, and I didn't want to be the little sister or the daughter, because that's who you become as an adult.","What's important in any working relationship or working with someone in your family is you have to start with a clean slate.","Relationships are temporary, and everyone needs to understand that.","Your instinct when someone is busy is to give them the least amount of work so that they can do it.","The truth is that the celebrities that transitioned into being business moguls or launching a brand have to be very smart, or at least be advised by very smart people.","There are so many shows that are 'white,' and we wanted to talk about how two really delusional, cliche white girls handle racial issues.","We don't mess with squads. Our friend group is not, like, a strategic thing. There's no strategy to our friendships. There's no strategy to the circle of girls. Everyone's, like, bound together for different things.","When you watch women who are a great mom, a great wife, and a great CEO, like, it's very inspiring. Like, being friends with Jessica Alba makes you work harder.","You take from things that you read about in the news or things you hear about or things that happen to you, and you collectively sit in a room with everyone, and everyone decides what the funniest stories are that you've heard or thought of.","Chris Martin is my best friend.","In L.A., you see a lot of women who get into these trends for inner happiness while putting most of their energy into looking younger. It's Botox on Tuesday, laser on Wednesday, some weird juice cleanse having nothing to do with health and everything to do with losing weight the next day.","It's OK to want to feel beautiful - as long as you really do the work on yourself to be the kind of person you are proud of.","Platform flip-flops. Those were crazy. Wait, I don't think they were ever fashionable. But we saw them everywhere.","I think I would want to be a therapist or sociologist. I love talking to people about their relationships and life problems, understanding where it comes from, and giving insight that's helpful. Also, it would be fun to just marry rich and vacation a lot. That's my real second choice.","I imagine when you're making a reality show with a whole crew, it's bound to get complicated.","It was not even that long ago when my acting career was in the gutter. I was just thinking that I didn't want to live a life still going on auditions and not getting work. I wasn't inspired or anything at the time, and it sucked.","I have no interest in feeling like a trophy. Money itself has never been attractive to me; instead, I prefer ambition and integrity.","When I was in my twenties, I was a self-conscious, out-of-work actress. Then I decided to be a writer and got hired on an NBC show that got canceled after one year. I was heavily discouraged by someone I worked for who told me I wasn't good.","Anyone who is on the verge of kind of famous but not really relevant is kind of fun to play with.","If you look at any sitcom that you watch, if it takes place in, say, a small town in Massachusetts, and it's about the dynamics of the people in that town, the showrunner probably grew up in a town like that, witnessed things, and created content.","I could not write on 'Downton Abbey'.","I've never dated anywhere else, so I only know L.A. dating, and I wouldn't wish it upon my worst enemy. I've pulled back and taken the pressure off of myself to figure it out, because there's so much pressure about status that dating has become this game where you pull out all your tricks.","I blame my parents for never introducing me to good music.","I find so much new music I didn't know about on my Sonos.","Puppies and kittens are both great. Cats and dogs are not for me.","If I'm awake at 2 A.M., I'm either suffering from anxiety or doing something I will regret tomorrow.","Everyone's trying to get a reality show, and we're just trying to avoid accidentally being on a reality show.","I always took myself really seriously in my 20s and needed everyone to know that I wasn't a spoiled blond actress.","We didn't have parents who let us get away with anything. We grew up here with privilege, and we never got a D.U.I., we never went to rehab, we never got pregnant.","Everyone is struggling to compete with how people consume television these days.","If I was in some Marvel movie and made all that Marvel money, you wouldn't see me ever again.","I think, in anyone's career, you have to map out some sort of strategy of steps that take you closer to the career you want.","With 'Barely Famous', we've tapped into and created something really exciting that we'll always be proud of going forward.","Sunday brunch at Soho House. The views of L.A. are spectacular.","The Beverly Hills Hotel is so iconic.","When we go out with friends for a dinner or something and we have friends that aren't there, for no reason other than they weren't invited because we only had room for a certain amount of people, we just don't post a picture because we don't want anyone to feel left out. What's the point?","Even Instagram has become a way to show off your girl group and make other girls feel left out.","Sara is about as tech-savvy as your grandma."],"Erin Gray":["I think I'm in the best place I've ever been in so many ways. I've just come out of five years of very difficult times for numerous reasons and yet at the same time it's lead to such growth. It's very exciting that way.","We have three centers: the emotional center, the intellectual center, and the physical body center. Each one of them has its own intelligence. How much better would we be if all three were working in unison?","I like exercise. I like a healthy body.","Yes. I was the first female colonel. I enjoyed being that kind of role model for young women watching the show. A woman can be a colonel! A woman can be in charge! Those were new ideas then.","When I first started acting, I had all these ideals about the kinds of roles I wanted to play, but the reality is that when you do television - and I do a lot of television - you get cast for qualities that you have as a person. So I look for qualities that I like to portray.","Every once in awhile I like to play dark ladies, crazy ladies, but most often I look for characters that are strong, intelligent, caring - usually earth women, because that's basically how I see myself.","I had a really negative look at the night-life side of Hollywood, which I really didn't like. I went to New York to focus on modeling, and then of course found that New York was not any different from Los Angeles.","A woman can be in charge!","As a child I had dealt with a lot of loss and grief. I was constantly losing my parents, losing my home, constantly moving around, living with this stranger, that stepfather, or whatever.","Learning how to get in tune with your field of energy and understand how to create your energy, expand that energy, and move that energy through your body. Coming back to your center, and approaching life from that center-to-line place... That to me gave me strength and understanding and hopefully wisdom to solve life's problems and challenges.","When you meditate or pray... both are forms of meditation... you give up control and find the answer and you open yourself to receive God's gift, the universal force, or whatever that is.","My mother and I always had full adult communication.","If you don't have a child, you're not a real woman. I know the ERA people will kill me for saying that.","I think there's been a major shift in grass roots media because of the Internet and because the geeks and nerds rule the world. They are in control in so many ways.","The comic is today's western, so many movies, and I think that if actors want to optimize their longevity, it's important for them to meet the fans because those fans are so loyal and will show up at any movie or tune in to any television show they're on."],"Erin Gruwell":["I have learned that, although I am a good teacher, I am a much better student, and I was blessed to learn valuable lessons from my students on a daily basis. They taught me the importance of teaching to a student - and not to a test.","I realized if you can change a classroom, you can change a community, and if you change enough communities you can change the world.","I am a teacher born and bred, and I believe in the advocacy of teachers. It's a calling. We want our students to feel impassioned and empowered.","I believe that all students, when asked to be accountable for their actions and to be socially aware citizens, will become agents for change!","When you're too robotic and scripted, the students tune you out. So I always tried to use different learning modalities - kinesthetic, auditory, visual, whatever might bring learning to life.","I believe that everyone has a story, and it is important that we encourage all students to tell theirs.","I believe that education is the greatest equalizer; thus, I will continue to fight to equalize the playing field in an educational atmosphere that is not always level!","The stories my pupils told me were astonishing. One told how he had witnessed his cousin being shot in the back five times; another how his parents had died of AIDS. Another said that he'd probably been to more funerals than parties in his young life. For me - someone who had had an idyllic, happy childhood - this was staggering.","Hoping they'd been inspired by the examples of Anne Frank and other teens who had turned negative experiences into something positive by writing about them, I handed out notebooks for my students to journal about their lives. There was some initial resistance. But then the stories poured out of them, full of anger and sadness.","Writing really evokes empathy in a way very few things can do.","Education is such a noble profession, it's a wonderful way to serve.","Writing is powerful. Whether it's a little girl hiding from the Nazis in an attic, or Amnesty International writing letters on behalf of political prisoners, the power of telling stories is usually what causes change.","I was going to show my kids that no matter what happened with their parents, parole officers and other teachers, I wouldn't give up on them. I let them know it matters to me that you come to class, it matters to me that you try, it matters to me when you succeed.","I grew up in a very progressive family and with a great educational system, and I asked myself, 'Why doesn't everybody have these opportunities for a good education? So why not give back to these kids who didn't grow up with the same privileges I had?'","Schools are not equal. There are still the haves and the have-nots.","Paying to teach in the trenches was like putting my face through a cutout hole at a carnival while a quarterback threw pies at me. At least with a carnival, I'd see it coming.","I think a lot of teachers feel like they're teaching to a test. Our response is you teach to a student, you really teach to the kid.","Some teachers feel that if they ask for emotional help, they're a failure. But teaching is a team sport.","That's the beauty of education, kids taking lessons out of the classroom and back into their own world where they can positively affect their family, their friends, and their greater community."],"Erin Heatherton":["If you work hard and you do your best, you can do anything.","Sexiness is all about your personality, being genuine and confident, and being a good person.","You really don't need to wear any make-up most of the time; keep your eyebrows the way they are, and find your own natural beauty signature.","Even if you don't have time for a big workout, stretching in the morning and night really changes your body.","There is just something about starting your day with something luxurious like a bath.","Being yourself is very sexy, you know?","Healthy body image is not something that you're going to learn from fashion magazines.","Love yourself no matter what!","People like to be around those who give off positive energy.","I have way too many candles. There's always a candle burning at home.","I love seeing new places and meeting new people. I'm sort of addicted to traveling.","My style is simple, kinda girly, but with a bit of an edge.","Photoshop makes things look beautiful just as you have special effects in movies. It's just a part of life.","It's important to be fit, but you shouldn't get too skinny. You need to have curves.","Rome is one of my favourite cities in the world.","Rudeness, I think, is the worst.","I never thought I was cute, ever.","I always stay active, even if I'm on vacation.","Inner beauty radiates from within, and there's nothing more beautiful than when a woman feels beautiful on the inside.","Working out gives me the opportunity to let go and listen to my music; it's a big stress reliever.","I think that, like any art, fashion is about expression. It allows you to express yourself and your identity through what you choose to wear.","Australian people are dope. They're so fun. They want to just have a good time, and they have a great sense of humour.","Life would be pretty boring if we didn't have vices.","The most important thing for staying in shape is having fun with your workouts.","I love the responsibility of being a Victoria's Secret spokesmodel. It's a great life skill.","I always love a side of guacamole with everything.","You could be doing a million butt lifts, but your butt is not going to get any bigger because there is nothing to build on. Your body needs food to make that happen.","I am genuine, fun and passionate.","I make sure the foods I eat will benefit the appearance of my hair, skin and nails.","Caviar's sexy.","My favorite memory from school was going to football games with my friends. We always had so much spirit and dressed up to go to the games, even though our team was pretty bad.","The short amount of time I'm out on the runway is like going on a rollercoaster. It's such a happy, exciting feeling. I'm more like a racehorse ready to go - I just want to get out there.","I shopped a lot on 1stdibs.com when I first started modelling. Just whenever, I've always been on and bought all my furniture on 1stdibs.com.","Perfection is really boring!","A mistake a lot of girls make is that they work out but don't eat enough. If you're not eating enough, all the work outs are doing, it's not going to show.","I work out twice a day, once in the morning and once before bed. I'll start with half an hour of running and then some yoga to stretch everything out so everything is warm.","It doesn't matter if you are model or not; confidence is something that comes from inside.","It's people's own prerogative to be able to look at something and know the difference between 'this is what someone looks like with make-up on' and 'this is what they look like in real life.'","I work out at least 5 times a week.","My exercise varies from yoga to Pilates. The yoga provides me with achieving my balance and mental relaxation, whereas the Pilates allow me to work my inner core through stretching and keeping my muscles toned.","My favourite beauty look is definitely '70s beauty - sun kissed skin, wavy hair and defined eyes.","I was such a tomboy - goofy and, in my eyes, nerdy - and I never thought I would end up in modeling. I mean, you see pictures of these girls in magazines who have this incredible talent, and no one ever really thinks you can make it to that level. At least I didn't!","I modeled for 4 years before I felt like I had my big break.","I don't think people should confuse fantasy and reality because no one is perfect - we all know that.","People should embrace themselves.","At home, I don't like to be just sitting around; I like to go out and do things. It's when I'm the happiest.","I had a boyfriend for a long time, and I've never really been single as an adult.","I think there's something special and timeless about girls getting ready together.","I use Rodin Luxury Face Oil at night, and it keeps my skin hydrated and refreshed for the day - not tired from all the makeup.","I love to learn, and Victoria's Secret has given me more opportunities than I ever thought possible. I like doing things that scare me - I've learned never to doubt myself.","Ballet Beautiful is really good for me, and it doesn't hurt my back, and it's a way for me to kind of get my heart moving and tone every part of my body.","I think a lot of women have back problems.","Backstage at the Victoria's Secret show is pure madness. Big personalities, big hair, and tons of press.","I played sports growing up in high school.","I actually have a little routine I do before every shoot. I put a face mask on before bed and make sure I go to sleep early. Then, I get up early and make myself breakfast and get in a workout.","I love doing my own make-up.","I swear by my Clarisonic Mia 2! I use it every morning when I wake up and every night before bed.","'Summer Heights High' is one of my favourite shows of all time. I'm obsessed. I re-watch it all the time.","Coming from an athletic background, the scientific aspect is a really big part of understanding beauty and how the body works.","Definitely, starting my own brand would be really exciting.","I've been to Australia several times, and I just like the earthiness; it's part of the culture. That's a really good vibe to be around.","I'm gluten free, but that still allows me some chocolate!","Music inspires me.","Rest is the best thing for your body rather than working out or dieting. Sleep can change your whole metabolism, so it's my number one priority when it comes to looking good.","I get so busy that I forget to eat, and that's really hurt me in the past. I gained weight from that.","I love lipbalms in general; they're very important!","I think New Orleans is the best city in the United States.","My best friend is Lily Aldridge. Her daughter's my godchild.","I've worked for years with Michael Kors, and he's just like this funny, charismatic guy.","As a model, you're such a gypsy, so that 'home' element is kind of taken from you.","I love going on dates and talking.","I'm a homebody, but I make people come to me, like, 'Everyone just come over, and we can have fun at my house.' I love to entertain.","I can shoot a basket pretty well.","I like to work hard and see the results of my hard work.","I can't maintain the body of a 16-year-old anymore. That's just a really boring life to me. You really just cannot do anything fun, ever.","It's really not important what my personal life is.","I need to pay people to make me work out, or I wouldn't do it.","I can't even sleep in. My body won't let me.","I've met some of my best friends in the world working for Victoria's Secret.","You can put in a curl or put on a lip color or mascara, but the important thing is that the health of your skin and hair is shining through.","I love being in Chicago.","I went to a private Jewish school before high school, and a lot of the kids had beautiful homes, but my parents don't really care about those kinds of things.","I definitely only want to do charity work that I'm hands-on involved in. I don't want to get a dress on and go to a stupid event."],"Erin Karpluk":["If I'm healthy, that comes across on camera.","Sometimes, as a guest actor, when you come on, you're coming into a show that's already been established, and the wheels are already in motion. It can be very nerve-wracking, jumping in as a newcomer, but everyone on 'Saving Hope' was so welcoming."],"Erin McKean":["For me, conferences are like little mental vacations: a chance to go visit an interesting place for a couple of days, and come back rested and refreshed with new ideas and perspectives.","If you're talking about how you promoted synergy in an organization, that could mean you just got everybody together for donuts twice a week.","Uniforms are intended to make the wearer look as strong as possible. Soldiers could fight in leotards, but that's never going to happen because leotards aren't intimidating.","You can limit the number of invitations to an in-person fashion show, but you can't police the Internet.","People say jargon is a bad thing, but it's really a shortcut vocabulary professionals use to understand one another.","Words take on many different meanings.","'Aging' has been bad ever since we figured out it led to dying.","If you say 'anti-aging,' how anti would it have to be, really? My guess is not much. Any amount of sunscreen could be considered anti-aging.","We've been using 'rejuvenate,' meaning to restore youth, to make young again, as a verb for at least 200 years.","There are very few good ways to get publicity for a dictionary.","All language is a popularity contest.","What I'm interested in is how people are reading and writing English.","Language is a nice way to remember things.","All words have life cycles.","If words are doing their job, then their novelty will not be the most noticeable thing about them.","It's difficult to choose a Word of the Year in the year that you're in. It's one of those things that hindsight makes more apparent. It's like looking at pictures from 10 years ago, and you notice the flannel and the ripped jeans. At the time, it didn't look to you like a real fashion trend.","I think we would all like to believe that every new event demands a new word. But we're environmentally conscious with our words. We recycle words we've got.","Writers who hedge their use of unfamiliar, infrequent, or informal words with 'I know that's not a real word,' hoping to distance themselves from criticism, run the risk of creating doubt where perhaps none would have naturally arisen.","Part of the joy and pleasure of English is its boundless creativity: I can describe a new machine as bicyclish, I can say that I'm vitamining myself to stave off a cold, I can complain that someone is the smilingest person I've ever seen, and I can decide, out of the blue, that 'fetch' is now the word I want to use to mean 'cool.'","Most consumers don't have a good metric for deciding on whether the dictionary they want to use is a good one... so they flip the book over, then go to the back, and it says, 'Over 250,000 entries.' And they go, 'Great, this dictionary must be awesome!'","There are hundreds of thousands of words that aren't in any print dictionary today... because there's no space for all of them.","We think people go to a dictionary to find out what a word means. Most people go to the dictionary because they don't want to look stupid.","Ideally my goal is, before I die, to have some information about every word that's ever been used in print.","Almost any word can be drafted to serve as a verb, even words we think of as eternal and unchanging, stuck in their more traditional roles.","Objections to verbification in English tend to be motivated by personal taste, not clarity. Verbed words are usually easily understood. When a word like 'friend' is declared not a verb, the problem isn't that it's confusing; it's that the protester finds it deeply annoying.","Twitter has already birthed an entire ecosystem of other sites that extend its power or interact with it. But Twitter isn't just a platform for technological innovation: It's showing signs as an engine of creativity for the language, too.","Twitter is like overhearing people's conversations, which is exactly what dictionary editors have been wishing we could do for years.","Lexicographers are language reporters.","Words are so lovable. How could you not love words?","By the time the traditionally male lexicographers become interested in looking at fashion words, their origins are lost in the mists of time.","The use of food metaphors is really well established English... Somebody is a peach, a hot tamale.","A love letter is to be savored; a love email... is to be forwarded to all your friends, and probably laughed at.","Most of the words you know and love and use every day are not words you learned by looking them up in a dictionary and reading a definition.","If anything is guaranteed to annoy a lexicographer, it is the journalistic habit of starting a story with a dictionary definition."],"Erin Moran":["I think it was a good thing that Joanie and Chachi married.","The first interview I went on I got at age 5. It was a commercial for First Federal Bank.","I have thought about Happy Days made into a movie. As far as the original cast not being a part of it, wow, I don't know who could be who! I just don't see it going in that direction. I can see the original cast doing the movie very easily though.","I can't get it out of my head that I would like to play some kind of psychotic.","Well, it is certainly not by choice at this time you don't see or hear about me. This business is very unpredictable. A lot of it is luck and being in the right place at the right time.","I am happily married to a wonderful man. He is not in the business.","There was mental and physical abuse in my family.","I liked wearing the '50s wardrobe. It was hard in the beginning. The first shows I wore regular young girl dresses. Then a little later I got to wear the poodle skirts and such.","I am still being recognized as Joanie and probably will as long as Happy Days is playing on TV and remembered by Happy Days fans. It has and will always be a pleasure and a honor for me to be a part of it.","I don't have any favorite episodes from 'Joanie Loves Chachi.' I liked working with the people. But I didn't even want to do it. I was talked into it.","I've been working since I was five!","For almost five years on 'Happy Days,' I have had a mom and pop and a brother who give me advice and help me just as my own parents and brothers and sisters do at home.","Show business is all I know, but I love it.","It is so discouraging to have your weight yo-yo.","Having two families is just natural to me. I guess when you're growing up, whatever is happening around you is the natural thing.","That's one thing about this business. You'd better give it your best, because you're stuck with that performance on film for the rest of your life.","You grow up and get married, and move away, but you're still a family. That's the way it will be with all of us on 'Happy Days.'","Acting has been my life since I was five, and everything has just fallen into place. I've never had to push and shove.","I've learned as well watching myself grow on TV.","I've always been scared to do a play. I don't know why, because doing 'Happy Days' was like a play with three cameras."],"Erin Morgenstern":["You don't have to be a chef or even a particularly good cook to experience proper kitchen alchemy: the moment when ingredients combine to form something more delectable than the sum of their parts. Fancy ingredients or recipes not required; simple, made-up things are usually even better.","I'm a firm believer that lighting affects mood, and twinkly lights on strings bring something magical to occasions ranging from concerts to weddings, though I'm fond of using them as year-round home decor. There's a reason why they're sometimes called fairy lights. When the night is right, there aren't any strings at all.","It is perhaps both a blessing and a curse that fictional worlds spring into my mind nearly fully formed and it takes quite a while to sift through everything to find the story.","I'm a firm believer that lighting affects mood, and twinkly lights on strings bring something magical to occasions ranging from concerts to weddings, though I'm fond of using them as year-round home decor.","You don't have to be a chef or even a particularly good cook to experience proper kitchen alchemy: the moment when ingredients combine to form something more delectable than the sum of their parts.","I love that very traditional fairy tale where it's not all 'happily ever after.' I like all that old school, bloody, 'Brothers Grimm' sort of stuff. So you have all those shades of gray in there.","I draft quickly and then revise, a lot.","It's said that All Hallows' Eve is one of the nights when the veil between the worlds is thin - and whether you believe in such things or not, those roaming spirits probably believe in you, or at least acknowledge your existence, considering that it used to be their own. Even the air feels different on Halloween, autumn-crisp and bright.","Tarot is just stories on cards.","I like that 'once upon a time' quality, where the telling of a tale has an elevated sense of story. There's a whimsical quality to it. Sometimes in fairy tales more things seem possible, even though often they're real world based.","I thought a circus environment would be an interesting venue to explore, where you didn't just have one tent with three rings and a show going on but where you could explore different things in different tents.","I feel 'The Night Circus' has a complete story arc in one book. I like it as a single volume. It feels complete to me, and I wouldn't want to stretch it out into something it's not.","If I had a story idea that I felt would work best in three volumes I might write a trilogy eventually. I'd very likely write it all at once, though, so I could work on it as a whole and not broken into individual volumes. I don't always write in order, so composing multi-book stories could get complicated.","I'm working on something that's not yet novel-shaped but is something of a film-noir-flavored 'Alice in Wonderland.' It will also very likely be a single volume story and not the start of a series.","I'm an emotional sort of person in general and I have a vivid imagination, so I feel the whole spectrum of emotion strongly when I write.","I binge write. I think it's because I started seriously writing by participating in National Novel Writing Month, an online-based challenge to write 50,000 words in 30 days.","I go back and forth between input phases where I'm reading a lot or trying to get out and explore the world a bit and soak up inspirations and then I'll get back into output mode and write and write and write.","I don't have any particular rituals, I sometimes like to write in longhand when I'm searching for ideas but I do the vast majority by typing, I can't always keep up with my thoughts longhand. I'm not a coffee shop writer because I feel obliged to order more coffee and then I end up over-caffeinated.","When I was growing up, if there was a Young Adult section of my town's library, I missed it. I wandered right from 'The Babysitter's Club' over to Stephen King. His books were big and fat and they seemed important. I eventually worked my way through most of the shelf, but 'It' is the one that stuck with me.","I like to call it nighttime brain: the way your mind seems to function on a different frequency than it does during daylight hours - which can be good or bad but also can lead to unexpected epiphanies or experiences that wouldn't be the same at any other time of day.","Writing in a near frenzy is wonderful and freeing, but for me, it did not result in a nice, shiny novel. Instead, what I have is a mess.","And now, I'm a best selling author, a different sort of fairy tale that I still sometimes wonder when I'll wake up from.","The circus itself is my personal ideal entertainment venue.","I'm kind of big on performance in general. I like the sort of entertainment where you can go in and be fully immersed in it.","I have absurdly vivid dreams.","I think I get some of my love of adult books that can be fun from Douglas Adams.","I think that's a hallmark of a really good story that it has readers that it speaks to more than others.","The fact that people are already reading and loving something I wrote is still hard to believe.","I am a fan of magic and fantasy, particularly when it's grounded in reality.","I'm actually not a huge circus fan in the traditional sense, but I like a lot of the circus trappings of striped tents and caramel. I lean more towards Cirque du Soleil than Barnum and Bailey.","I liked the idea of having actual magic performed as stage magic, so you could assume that it was just a trick, that something is all smoke and mirrors, but there's that, like, feeling at the back of your mind: What if it's not?","I paint very messy. I throw paint around. So when I let myself do the same sort of thing with my writing, and I would just write and write and write and revise, that's when I found my rhythm in writing.","I keep waiting for things to get back down to whelming, but they stay at overwhelming.","Plot is not my forte. It's like I have to live in my head in the book for a while before I figure out what the story is... My process is a bit messier.","It's helpful for me to get ideas - the physical action of painting. Sometimes it frees up your writer brain. It's nice for me now that the writing has become a serious career that painting can become more like a hobby.","Comic-Con was crazy, good crazy... Five minutes after I'm done, the cast of 'Twilight' is where I was sitting.","Sometimes I write what I can't paint, and I paint what I can't write. I use a different part of the brain.","It's a wonderful sort of feeling when people want to spend more time in a world you created.","I don't always write in order, so composing multi-book stories could get complicated.","If I had a story idea that I felt would work best in three volumes I might write a trilogy eventually. I'd very likely write it all at once, though, so I could work on it as a whole and not broken into individual volumes.","Writing in a near-frenzy is wonderful and freeing but, for me, it does not result in a nice shiny novel. Instead what I have is a mess.","When you meet someone new who instantly gets you, your sense of humor and your attitudes and your worldview, even if theirs are different - and you get them in return. You both talk and talk and agree and laugh and nod and yes, yes, of course you should get another round of drinks.","I don't have as tight a time limit anymore but I still write in long marathon sessions and then I won't write for a while, I'm not a write-every-day writer."],"Erin Moriarty":["My parents are both very stylish, so they always encouraged me to explore when it came to personal style. I went through a lot of crazy phases, and I'm still finding myself.","Throughout high school, I was fairly boring. I didn't do many rebellious things.","I love romantic comedies... but they have to be done right, but when they are, they're great.","'Fargo' definitely makes it into my top three favorite films of all time; I have a serious obsession with the Coen brothers.","I would love to work with the Coen brothers and Terrence Malick. I love both of their bodies of work so much, so I'm really interested in acting under their direction.","Jordan Vogt-Roberts directed me in 'Kings of Summer,' which was his debut feature. I got to witness the passion and hunger that first-time directors bring to projects, and ever since, then I've been very intrigued when I've come across a project with a less experienced director."],"Erin O'Connor":["Cycling is a great way to learn about your city. I love being outdoors, especially in good weather, but I'm not a fair weather cyclist. I'm happy to get a red nose in the cold.","Caution is the key to safe cycling. I'm aware that cars are bigger than me, but I feel quite safe. I'm in control, liberated and free, when I'm on my bike.","I am aware it's easy and may be fashionable to pose with a slum child, and the irony of getting the media along means that it can come across as disingenuous. But you take these things on board, and you hope you mean it whenever you get stuck into something.","I think there is some resistance when people talk about ethical fashion, and a tendency to panic that if you're bringing a moral agenda and highlighting the origins of the garments, you can't incorporate style. But there's no reason why style and conscience can't co-exist.","I seem to disappoint people a bit. They want the full regalia - but I don't walk around in a corset the whole time.","It's not about hiding your imperfections on a shoot; it's about embracing them and being unapologetic about them.","My perfect bag would be practical but also have the stylish element to it; it would be bold and colourful. I would actually be able to open and close it. That would be a first.","It makes me cross when I hear people say, 'It's so last season.' I always say, 'It's vintage.'","I lead a very busy life and don't have a lot of time, so my skincare needs to be easy and portable.","Winter is my favourite season.","At school I was very shy and coincidentally inherited the title 'little miss worry guts,' and that was just among the staff. I learned early on that I could make people laugh, and as my small neat body betrayed me by growing to dizzying heights, I used it as a tool that translated into complete slap-stick comedy.","I think most models fear growing old, but from a tender age I had always chosen to play someone grown up. I am slowly but surely catching up with the people that I have spent the last decade and a half trying to portray.","I'm like a tourist when I'm in London.","A girl must have an indefinable magic, real character, a strong sense of self. Her role is to respond to the brief of a photographer or communicate the vision of a designer - while making whatever she does look utterly effortless and whatever she wears utterly seamless.","I am concerned about ageism and the loss of beauty - the perception that as you grow older, you 'lose your looks,' which I think is diabolical.","I can play the flute. Music was my favourite A-level, and I used to love composing my and stylising my voice to sound like 90's singing sensation Tori Amos.","It's like recycling: selling old clothes to help make new ones.","I've been cycling ever since I was a kid. I remember taking my cycling proficiency test aged seven - I got to school at 7:30 A.M. to practise, I was so nervous. After that, I always cycled to school.","I understood early on that I was not the best-looking girl in the room. But I knew my advantage was a hard work ethic and I was ambitious: I knew I could be a great model.","I've been on both sides: the victim and the villain. I was the victimised model, and everything from my weight to my fertility was held up for discussion. And then I was the person that could garner some kind of positive outcome, by taking on the role of vice chairman of the British Fashion Council and becoming an activist of body image.","Fear has been my biggest friend. Fear of the unknown. Whenever I've been afraid, I've been very self-protective.","In my career, which has been fairly two-dimensional, people make decisions based on your persona.","The model sanctuary was borne of a complex, political, societal debate. It was proposed to us from various bodies that we give models medicals once a year, and if they didn't pass that medical, there's a chance they'd legally lose their right to work.","The Model Sanctuary is not about self-indulgence - it's about reminding and allowing them to become self-sufficient human beings. I wanted to alert people to the fact that we're not the victims, but nor are we the villains. We want fair practice and positive, sustainable change, working with the fashion industry, not against it.","Someone once referred to modeling as being like winning the lottery gene pool. It's such an odd way to put things, but what is different about modelling is that the industry often picks you.","As a model, part of my job is to be critiqued physically.","Fashion is intoxicating, and it plays a part in all of our everyday lives. A lot of people use it as a form of escape, of realising a fantasy, and in some ways that becomes an unobtainable norm.","With high fashion, it's a performance. You're trying to interpret a fantasy in a very physical way, and you really are playing a character. I've played men, dead people, famous people, historical icons, and it's no mean feat. It's quite an insular experience even though the crowd is in front of you and there's an expectation.","I take my mentoring responsibilities very seriously.","I've worn a lot of humdingers in my time, but as a model it's my duty - my responsibility - to bring life to any garment. That can be challenging when it comes to high fashion, where the creations can be very eccentric, but I've gained a reputation for being the go-to girl who can pull it off.","I love the physicality of my job and how my mind and body are most happy when I'm expressing and moving. My face was always secondary to body alignment and the dynamism of making a moment come alive.","New York is on a grid system, so it's slightly less challenging logistically, but Londoners are more relaxed in their selling approach. With that intense shopping service in New York, it's easy to get carried away and make a wrong purchase. Here, there's a different flow. You are left to explore, and individuality is key.","The 'Best of British' is a positive thing that's bandied around, but also it's applied pressure to our country in terms of economic growth. I think we've always felt the rest of the world is so much more powerful in terms of being commercially viable, but we can take great pride in our level of creativity.","We won't get economic growth if we don't look after our mothers and the potential of the next generation. They need to be prioritised.","My plan growing up was to leave home and try not to panic. I always knew that to strive to be self-sufficient was an important ambition.","When I was at primary school, we had this theory that if you ate an egg, it meant you'd get pregnant and give birth to a chicken or another egg. It was something we dared together. I avoided eggs for years, but now they're my favourite food.","When I was 13 or 14, my parents had a bit of a windfall so bought a lovely new kitchen, but I burnt it down. I was making cheese on toast when flames escaped from the grill. My father stopped the fire with blind panic and excessive water. I was forgiven, but it put me off cooking for years.","As a small child, me and my pals fantasised about one day owning an ice-cream van. To have ice creams on demand would have been a dream come true.","For my last meal, I'd want an Irish breakfast with soda bread and one of my dad's omelettes with three or four eggs.","In my job, I am portrayed as a misfit, a grandiose high fashion lady or an unearthly creature. At home, it's important I can look in the mirror, strip away the disguise and be comfortable with who stares back.","My hair is an untidy bob. I am very dark, but I embellish the roots because I am white in one clump.","I want to show that we all have the right to be ourselves, and I certainly don't want to freeze time.","I am rubbish at the gym. I prefer to exercise by moving around - it doesn't matter whether I am dancing on a Friday night or on my bike getting from A to B.","I love the sun, but we don't get on at all; it doesn't agree with my Celtic tones. I also like nothing better than putting on a big ski jacket and feeling the wind in my face.","The great outdoors is a theme with me; a walking holiday in Scotland is perfect - Culloden and the forests of Aviemore are both favourites.","I've enjoyed many camping holidays with my sister and her children, but we're pretty posh campers.","In my work, I'm called to a job at the drop of a hat, so I like a sense of order to my holidays, and holding a map makes me happy.","My job is to sell clothes to very rich women.","When you're physically growing up, you develop emotionally with that.","I would say I live half in New York and half in Claridge's. How decadent! How hysterical!","How awful to be a perfect beauty! How confusing! God. Can you imagine?","When I first began modeling, I was very conventional looking. I had hair down to my waist in a side parting - almost church-like. But beneath the sheath of hair lay this Amazonian, strong-looking frame.","My story wasn't one of those cliched stories of being an ugly duckling, I had a pretty good time at school. But then I think being six foot by the age of 15 meant that I couldn't help but be noticed, and that was when my physical being felt quite painful - I could not any longer walk into a room without being noticed.","I think most of my career has been built on conviction and the personality to carry that image or stride confidently on the catwalk. That was my beginning and, hopefully, my legacy.","I have two curiosity cabinets at home filled with finds from jumble sales, markets and my travels. My favourite piece is a voodoo mask from just outside Cape Town.","I am the world's laziest shopper, but very rarely have I had to take anything back.","I am selective. If I do splash out, it's an investment, and I wear things for years.","In the early days of my modelling career, I think the industry was uncomfortable with how strikingly different I was.","I worry about how accessible cosmetic surgery has become. Of course, if it has genuinely helped people, and their confidence has grown as a result; who am I to form an opinion?","I'm too diplomatic. I tend to edit my mind before I speak - it can be incredibly draining.","Growing up, I had an insane crush on Neil Tennant of the Pet Shop Boys.","It's a very intimate thing to invite someone into your home; there's a lot of trust involved.","As I began to get a deeper understanding of the vital life-saving work Save the Children does, I felt compelled to help in any way I could. This is about safe-keeping, inspiring and empowering a future generation - to facilitate them to make their own lives a little bit better.","It's a big shame that when you have a platform to write about Save the Children, the media interest lies with my moral alignment.","I'm interested in looking for solutions because it's become the case that in fashion you're either a villain or a victim. Look at the industry's very limited remit in terms of body size, for example.","I have previously been a very enthusiastic consumer, and I didn't think about the origins of garments enough.","I do like shopping high street, but I do consider the long-term value of a specific piece and, also, one day giving it up for somebody else to love and enjoy.","I'm utterly androgynous, and I truly love it. It's been part of my identity for so long. I've never been that pretty girl, and I wouldn't want to be.","Rejection is, of course, part of any successful model's career, as ironic as that sounds. It's how you pick yourself up and get on with the job.","Starting my career in London was no accident because the city and the industry here are all about theatre and drama, and I respond well to that.","Water - I drink gallons of it! You can use the most luxurious skincare products in the world, but they won't work as well if you do not hydrate from inside.","I have a regular cleansing, toning and moisturising routine.","Clothes are like a suit of armour when you're young. I was quite a shy teen, so I wanted to make aggressive statements with the way I looked. I'd say my goth/indie stage was the worst: there was a lot of experimentation involving pink food dye in my fringe.","I love vintage clothes. But they don't love me very much. It is difficult to find anything that fits me because of my height, but if I do fall in love with something, I'll buy it and display it like a work of art at home.","My style has been nurtured over time. It's more about knowing what doesn't suit you. I love suits and anything sharp, and I know that shape suits me. I don't feel feminine in floaty dresses with spaghetti straps - I feel more like Freddie Mercury in drag.","I had one particular handbag disaster when I couldn't get into it, and when I finally did, it flew over the red carpet and was caught by 200 lenses. Not a great moment.","Conformism is a potent statement, and as much as we do talk about individuality in fashion, there's a sense that people are fearful of not conforming and not being part of action.","There are great slender models, great tall models, Amazonian models, great busty models - my point is models of all shapes and sizes, age, ethnic background should be embraced and celebrated."],"Erin Richards":["I'm so laid back and not high maintenance in the slightest. If I did get married, I'd probably be dancing down the aisle with the groom. I'd like something unconventional!","I'm good at keeping secrets. My friends always tell me their secrets because I keep them well.","I've always been a massive fan of Batman. He didn't have any powers, so it meant that anyone could be Batman.","I do love doing stunts; I was in a film called 'The Quiet Ones,' which was quite a spooky film, and I had to be hung upside down, which was good.","I always used to put on plays when I was younger for my family to watch, when I was 10 or something. I used to force older members of my family to watch the plays and younger members of my family to be characters in the plays - and my personal favorite was Batman.","In real life, you don't know what's going to happen to you, so why would your character know? It's liberating to play the emotion your character is feeling at the time and not know what's coming up. I like it.","I'm not the marrying type! But if I did get married, I definitely wouldn't be a bridezilla.","I love low-budget projects with great acting and great stories you can really get your teeth into.","I do have a bit of a gravelly voice; people have told me I've got a good voice for radio."],"Erin Wasson":["I love heights. I love speed. I'm on the verge of being a pyromaniac. Maybe my phobia is boredom.","I'm passionate about being true to myself, sending good energy to the people around me, traveling, staying inspired, being a good friend, being a good daughter, being a good sister.","The people who really know me understand that I have a tough exterior, but I'm actually just a hippie at heart.","When I'm not working, I want to be the version of the person that I was born to be. I was born with curly hair. It fits my personality, and it's totally who I am. I am rough around the edges, and I am not a polished girl.","My mother gave me a pair of diamond earrings when I was 13. It symbolised becoming a teenager. I also remember getting a collection of costume jewellery from my grandmother when I was in high school.","I'm really not into that super-crazy-colour, smiley-faces-on-the-front-of-your-dress look. That's not my thing. You're not going to see me in pink. Or anything frilly. Or a tutu. Or bows.","When I find something at a flea market or an antique store, it feels more special and I'm more inclined to want to wear it.","I don't think about fashion or trends - I've never really been that kind of person.","To be given the reins of creativity is a beautiful thing when you're used to just showing up to a casting and standing there having clothes put on you.","I don't like precious things; I don't spend thousands of dollars on jewellery for myself. I like going into a junk store and finding something for five dollars. That's my style.","The older I get, I'm definitely getting pulled towards the West Coast, because it's a different quality of life. New York is great when you're in your early 20s and you're running around and it's really fun, but it's a place for me to get things done.","I've never been a girly-girl, never drawn to things that are fussy.","I shop a lot more for furniture than I do for clothes. I much prefer going to an antique shop full of obscurities.","I'm really happy with everything that I've been fortunate enough to do and with the creative outlets I've been blessed to have.","I was a total jock growing up. I went to super-dorky basketball clinics and was handpicked to play on a state team called the Texas Heat.","I'm a huge Dallas Mavs fan. What I love about Dirk Nowitzki is he has just as much talent as everyone else, if not more, and he never toots his own horn. He's this silent warrior.","I loathe hair salons. People have always told me I am in the wrong business because I can't stand getting my hair cut or having it messed around with. Hairdressers feel as if they've got to be your shrinks. I just want them to do my hair so I can get out of there.","I think a lot of people know me for just wearing cut-off denim shorts, an oversized white T-shirt with a pair of high-heels. I usually do wear basic stuff. Jeans and a white T is my go-to look.","I really like the idea of being utilitarian. My dream is to edit down my wardrobe and be very Japanese, where you have one rolling rack and it's like your four T-shirts, your five dresses, your two pairs of jeans.","I never expected to be a model. I never expected to be a stylist. Or a designer.","In the United States of America, we are so liberal-minded on so many different aspects, but for some reason there's always going to be this weird connection with nudity being a bad thing. Americans can be so prude sometimes.","Each piece of jewellery tells a story of my life. Picking one particular piece as a favorite would be like taking a chapter out of a book.","I've always been a girl with a massive opinion.","I don't have a background in design, so I think it's always about what I see in the world and what inspires me. So yes, I am designing for myself. I'm going through this whole evolution, which is a process of growing up and going from modeling to styling to designing.","I love being a gypsy. Home is between New York and California.","When you're comfortable, you're more confident - I really believe that. If you're walking around in a dress or a pair of shoes that are uncomfortable, it reads all over you.","My perspective is hard because I look at wardrobe from very much a guy's perspective. You look at my closet and I have pairs of black jeans and five button-downs, but one's silk, one's cotton. They all are slightly different, so that's my perspective.","The older I get, the more I like the idea of utilitarianism. I think that I'm not a trend-driven person. I really believe in keeping your canvas very basic and sort of adding the accouterments from there. I look at creating intrigue with outfits through accessories.","I think people find it weird that I have a lot of long antique-lace dresses that I wear with boots.","I want to create a lifestyle niche for that cool girl who's really into fashion but not too obsessed with it."],"Erin Way":["Being a woman, an actor in Hollywood, I know that there are certain parts I won't often get a chance to do.","I'm interested in making films that make people think.","Maybe 'Doonby' will haunt people for awhile and make them wonder, 'What was that really about?' And that excites me as an artist.","You name the sci-fi shows, and I'm a huge sucker for them."],"Erinn Hayes":["I'm not a short person; I'm 5'10 and I was wearing heels, and I felt like a tiny little creature next to Shaquille O'Neal.","I used to watch 'Grey's Anatomy' pretty religiously.","I was so sad that 'Best Friends Forever' got cancelled. I thought it was a great show and NBC didn't give it a chance. I'm a big fan of the NBC comedies.","It's such a weird thing to try to plan a baby around a TV season. There's a three-month or four-month window in the summertime to have a baby and hang out with it a little bit before hopefully going back to work, so we were just very lucky."],"Erinn Smart":["My brother is my best friend. Usually, when I'm fencing, I can hear his voice.","I think swimming's hard because I can't float.","My brother is my best friend.","Being one point ahead at the end - that's all that matters."],"Eriq La Salle":["The Sixth Sense is not a good white film. Insomnia is not a good white film. They're just good films. So why we can't we have good films that happen to have black people, or Asian, or Latino, or any other minority group in them?","Art should offend people because art should challenge people.","You can't do psychological thrillers. There's no audience. I've heard this. I've heard this from studios.","The films that have influenced me and the films that have motivated me and inspired me were films that resonated, films that made me think after I saw them.","So It's not like I go from being this disciplined person who has to get up and go to work to now I just lay around all day in my underwear eating Cheerios. I have this structure. I still have to do this and the difference is I'm doing this for me and my company.","Well that's the point: People don't normally take away things from films anymore. You go and see a $100 million film, half an hour later, your biggest concern is what are you going to be eating.","So that, to me, is important that audiences are treated with an amount of respect toward their intelligence. Most Hollywood films don't respect their intelligence.","Regardless of what people ultimately think about Crazy As Hell, It's not the type of film that, ten minutes after seeing it, you're only focused on what you want to eat.","Normally, we see characters that have God complexes. How interesting, I thought, it would be to capitalize on that. And say, OK, well fine, you have a God complex, well this person has a Satan complex. And the doctor chooses to treat him scientifically.","Maybe It's not the biggest blockbuster film, but there will be some people that will see it, that will be debating it, that will be questioning their own sense of spirituality. If the film resonates, then I have succeeded in what I set out to do.","Just trying to get a film made which is always difficult no matter what kind of a budget you have. Not having a budget makes it even more difficult. Having nineteen days and no budget makes it extremely difficult.","It's my company and I believe in the company that's why I started it.","I think that you make the best choice with the information that you have before you at that given time.","I think American cinema, particularly, has become so disposable. It's not even cinema, It's just moviemaking.","I don't see me doing $100 million films because $100 million films, the very nature of them, you need to offend as few people as possible just to make your money back.","Ever since I've left, I've been doing nothing but this film and traveling, promoting and doing festivals. So the good thing is that I'm not sitting around pining over whether I made the right choice in leaving. I'm moving and grooving.","But I try not to become preoccupied with that because with whatever direction I follow, with whatever advice I've followed or not followed, It's landed me in New York, in a very beautiful hotel, talking to people about something that I love. So I ain't that far off.","But I did on projects that I produced, that I directed, that I acted in because it was important. I want to be a filmmaker. I don't want to be an actor who directs, I want to be a director. I want to be a filmmaker. So that's a big difference."],"Erland Josephson":["I was mainly a stage actor. I found film acting mechanical, because it was so technical - there was so much technique with the lamps and the movements of the camera.","Stage acting is for me the basic form of acting. If you make films all the time, you have so few possibilities to rehearse. And it's important to rehearse, because it gives you the possibility to try things which are not good!","I'm too impatient to wait for things to happen to me. If I should be out of work for two months I would go crazy. So as soon as I'm free, I start writing. While it is necessary for me to write, I know that if I go too long without acting on the stage I don't feel well.","A man obsessed with failure has succeeded better than others in portraying it.","I am of the international upper class, the Swedish petit bourgeoisie of Jewish extraction with poor language skills, a conveyor of a few expressions and faces, with some intonation that combines ancient human experience with timely coquetry.","I can remember the moment when I suddenly felt that the camera was a living partner. I suddenly felt this is art, and the camera is a co-operative living person. After that I was extremely happy to act in films.","I very often get that question: 'What is your real profession?' That's because in Sweden, it is 'not allowed' to have more than one profession - there's something suspicious about it! But nowadays it's more accepted that one can do a lot of things.","Acting has a strong sensual quality that I get such a... you say 'kick' in America? It's a fantastic profession in that way."],"Erle Stanley Gardner":["After you've written a story, the thing to do is sell it. Sounds simple, and it is, if one will follow certain basic principles of salesmanship.","The real trouble with the writing game is that no general rule can be worked out for uniform guidance, and this applies to sales as well as to writing."],"Erma Bombeck":["There is a thin line that separates laughter and pain, comedy and tragedy, humor and hurt.","Never go to a doctor whose office plants have died.","Never have more children than you have car windows.","Dreams have only one owner at a time. That's why dreamers are lonely.","Guilt: the gift that keeps on giving.","When I stand before God at the end of my life, I would hope that I would not have a single bit of talent left, and could say, 'I used everything you gave me'.","I haven't trusted polls since I read that 62% of women had affairs during their lunch hour. I've never met a woman in my life who would give up lunch for sex.","If you can't make it better, you can laugh at it.","Marriage has no guarantees. If that's what you're looking for, go live with a car battery.","When your mother asks, 'Do you want a piece of advice?' it is a mere formality. It doesn't matter if you answer yes or no. You're going to get it anyway.","On vacations: We hit the sunny beaches where we occupy ourselves keeping the sun off our skin, the saltwater off our bodies, and the sand out of our belongings.","Car designers are just going to have to come up with an automobile that outlasts the payments.","It is not until you become a mother that your judgment slowly turns to compassion and understanding.","The only reason I would take up jogging is so that I could hear heavy breathing again.","One thing they never tell you about child raising is that for the rest of your life, at the drop of a hat, you are expected to know your child's name and how old he or she is.","When a child is locked in the bathroom with water running and he says he's doing nothing but the dog is barking, call 911.","I have a theory about the human mind. A brain is a lot like a computer. It will only take so many facts, and then it will go on overload and blow up.","Like religion, politics, and family planning, cereal is not a topic to be brought up in public. It's too controversial.","There's something wrong with a mother who washes out a measuring cup with soap and water after she's only measured water in it.","All of us have moments in our lives that test our courage. Taking children into a house with a white carpet is one of them.","My theory on housework is, if the item doesn't multiply, smell, catch fire, or block the refrigerator door, let it be. No one else cares. Why should you?","A grandmother pretends she doesn't know who you are on Halloween.","Do you know what you call those who use towels and never wash them, eat meals and never do the dishes, sit in rooms they never clean, and are entertained till they drop? If you have just answered, 'A house guest,' you're wrong because I have just described my kids.","Once you get a spice in your home, you have it forever. Women never throw out spices. The Egyptians were buried with their spices. I know which one I'm taking with me when I go.","Don't confuse fame with success. Madonna is one; Helen Keller is the other.","My second favorite household chore is ironing. My first being hitting my head on the top bunk bed until I faint.","I come from a family where gravy is considered a beverage.","People shop for a bathing suit with more care than they do a husband or wife. The rules are the same. Look for something you'll feel comfortable wearing. Allow for room to grow.","I never leaf through a copy of National Geographic without realizing how lucky we are to live in a society where it is traditional to wear clothes.","Getting out of the hospital is a lot like resigning from a book club. You're not out of it until the computer says you're out of it.","Why would anyone steal a shopping cart? It's like stealing a two-year-old.","Never lend your car to anyone to whom you have given birth.","It takes a lot of courage to show your dreams to someone else.","I take a very practical view of raising children. I put a sign in each of their rooms: 'Checkout Time is 18 years.'","In two decades I've lost a total of 789 pounds. I should be hanging from a charm bracelet.","Never go to your high school reunion pregnant or they will think that is all you have done since you graduated.","For years my wedding ring has done its job. It has led me not into temptation. It has reminded my husband numerous times at parties that it's time to go home. It has been a source of relief to a dinner companion. It has been a status symbol in the maternity ward.","I've exercised with women so thin that buzzards followed them to their cars.","What's with you men? Would hair stop growing on your chest if you asked directions somewhere?","When humor goes, there goes civilization.","House guests should be regarded as perishables: Leave them out too long and they go bad.","Did you ever notice that the first piece of luggage on the carousel never belongs to anyone?","Sometimes I can't figure designers out. It's as if they flunked human anatomy.","There is nothing more miserable in the world than to arrive in paradise and look like your passport photo.","How come anything you buy will go on sale next week?","Never accept a drink from a urologist.","Thanks to my mother, not a single cardboard box has found its way back into society. We receive gifts in boxes from stores that went out of business twenty years ago.","There's nothing sadder in this world than to awake Christmas morning and not be a child.","No one ever died from sleeping in an unmade bed. I have known mothers who remake the bed after their children do it because there is wrinkle in the spread or the blanket is on crooked. This is sick.","Children make your life important.","My kids always perceived the bathroom as a place where you wait it out until all the groceries are unloaded from the car.","Someone once threw me a small, brown, hairy kiwi fruit, and I threw a wastebasket over it until it was dead.","Who in their infinite wisdom decreed that Little League uniforms be white? Certainly not a mother.","Humorists can never start to take themselves seriously. It's literary suicide.","Onion rings in the car cushions do not improve with time.","I will buy any creme, cosmetic, or elixir from a woman with a European accent.","Before you try to keep up with the Joneses, be sure they're not trying to keep up with you.","Housework, if you do it right, will kill you.","Some say our national pastime is baseball. Not me. It's gossip.","A friend never defends a husband who gets his wife an electric skillet for her birthday.","Somewhere it is written that parents who are critical of other people's children and publicly admit they can do better are asking for it.","Thanksgiving dinners take eighteen hours to prepare. They are consumed in twelve minutes. Half-times take twelve minutes. This is not coincidence.","A friend doesn't go on a diet because you are fat.","God created man, but I could do better.","If a man watches three football games in a row, he should be declared legally dead.","Youngsters of the age of two and three are endowed with extraordinary strength. They can lift a dog twice their own weight and dump him into the bathtub.","It goes without saying that you should never have more children than you have car windows.","A friend will tell you she saw your old boyfriend - and he's a priest.","I was too old for a paper route, too young for Social Security and too tired for an affair.","I was terrible at straight items. When I wrote obituaries, my mother said the only thing I ever got them to do was die in alphabetical order.","In general my children refuse to eat anything that hasn't danced in television.","Being a child at home alone in the summer is a high-risk occupation. If you call your mother at work thirteen times an hour, she can hurt you.","For some of us, watching a miniseries that lasts longer than most marriages is not easy.","I have a hat. It is graceful and feminine and give me a certain dignity, as if I were attending a state funeral or something. Someday I may get up enough courage to wear it, instead of carrying it.","Most women put off entertaining until the kids are grown.","Never order food in excess of your body weight.","There is one thing I have never taught my body how to do and that is to figure out at 6 A.M. what it wants to eat at 6 P.M."],"Erna Solberg":["The future of Norway isn't about competing on being the cheapest but the most innovative. We have an expensive welfare state, and the only answer to continue that way is to become more competitive, especially on knowledge.","For a small country like Norway, it's important for our ability to trade and to invest across borders that we have fair trade and that we have multilateral trade systems, also.","People will buy a good electrical car instead of buying a fossil-fuel one, and you get a much better standard of car.","When you are a country that is economically well-off - we are not leaving people to live on the street without help - then you have to be strict on immigration because you become the most attractive country to go to.","Norway has had a carbon tax in place for a long time. This has not slowed down industrial development. Rather, it has encouraged innovation and the development of solutions that reduce emissions and bring down operating costs.","Afghanistan has safe zones... so it's possible to send grown-ups back to that country. We can't empty Afghanistan.","Slowly, the oil and gas sector will decrease in Norway. The question in Norway is about how fast it will decrease.","If you want to decrease housing costs in Norway, the most important thing is to build more.","We must fight for liberal ideas like openness, but also about having a media that we believe in and that can sort between real news and facts and not-so-factual things.","Norway is combating climate change. It's an important issue for us. And we are committed to the Paris Agreement.","We've been agreeing on a strict immigration policy to Norway for a long time. It's supposed to be fair, but it's supposed to be strict.","We can't just live as rentiers off the oil fund.","As long as we get stronger growth and a better economy, it will impact the krone.","I fear a very hard Brexit, but I hope we will find a better solution.","I hope that we will find a solution that leaves Britain as a partner in a lot of the European activities that we need them to be a partner in.","We are a small country. That means there will be lots of similarities in policies. The priorities are about the same issues - you have to create more jobs; you have to invest in people so they are qualified for the jobs the new economy will bring.","In our view, the main role of the government in the green transition is to ensure a predictable framework and a level playing field for innovation, industry, and enterprise. And, most importantly, to provide clear direction.","As long as we are one of the most expensive countries to produce in, we should focus on cutting costs that directly and indirectly weigh on business.","We have to dare to modernize to get room to maneuver for the priorities in the future.","Taxes are an important tool for us together with infrastructure investments, research, and development to create more jobs.","We don't believe that Russia is a direct threat to Norway, but we believe that Russia has become more unpredictable in its policies.","It's always important not to fall for the narrative of the terrorists. If you want to fight for getting a normal life back, you also have to participate.","The private-public partnership models that have been made in the area of health - we really need to adopt those in the area of education.","China is our largest trading partner in Asia. The normalization of our relations will create major opportunities for Norwegian businesses and for job creation. We also hope to resume negotiations on a free trade agreement with China."],"Ernest Bevin":["Unintelligent people always look for a scapegoat.","The most conservative man in this world is the British trade unionist when you want to change him.","There never has been a war yet which, if the facts had been put calmly before the ordinary folk, could not have been prevented. The common man, I think, is the great protection against war."],"Ernest Borgnine":["I'm what you call a Depression sailor.","I think we all have the urge to be a clown, whether we know it or not.","To this day I clean better than most maids.","I don't care whether a role is 10 minutes long or two hours. And I don't care whether my name is up there on top, either. Matter of fact, I'd rather have someone else get top billing; then if the picture bombs, he gets the blame, not me.","I got a job immediately after leaving high school; I was lucky - three dollars a week and all I could eat, working on a vegetable truck.","I've been to a number of places and seen for myself the caliber of people who are in the Navy today - in all the services for that matter. This is an altogether different bunch. These people of today are really bright, young, good people.","The Navy has changed a great deal. Not that the officers of my day were bad, because I served under a lot of good officers, believe me. But there were a few bad ones, too.","The trick is not to become somebody else. You become somebody else when you're in front of a camera or when you're on stage. There are some people who carry it all the time. That, to me, is not acting.","Everything I do has a moral to it.","Writers used to make such wonderful pictures without all that swearing, all that cursing. And now it seems that you can't say three words without cursing. And I don't think that's right.","My mother made me do all the housework as a boy. I still do it, even in hotels.","The Oscar made me a star, and I'm grateful. But I feel had I not won the Oscar I wouldn't have gotten into the messes I did in my personal life.","I wouldn't trade those 10 years for anything. The Navy taught me a lot of things. It molded me as a man, and I made a lot of wonderful friends.","I just want to do more work. Every time I step in front of a camera I feel young again. I really do. It keeps your mind active and it keeps you going.","I don't chart out the life histories of the people I play. If I did, I'd be in trouble. I work with my heart and my head, and naturally emotions follow."],"Ernest Bramah":["Where the road bends abruptly, take short steps.","Although there exist many thousand subjects for elegant conversation, there are persons who cannot meet a cripple without talking about feet.","He who thinks he is raising a mound may only in reality be digging a pit.","A reputation for a thousand years may depend upon the conduct of a single moment."],"Ernest Cline":["I don't know if the '80s were unique, but we certainly got original, groundbreaking stuff at the time with movies like 'Back to the Future' and 'Star Wars' - movies that became classics.","I don't even think I was quite a year old. My mother was maybe seven months pregnant with my little brother. I was sucked out of her arms, and she landed 75 yards away from our trailer and had a ruptured disc. The tornado set me down on top of this pile of corrugated lumber and scrap metal.","I was just starting out, trying to become a screenwriter, and I became the Austin slam champion three times. For a nerdy, kind of a socially awkward guy, that did wonders for my self esteem.","I have to avoid things like 'World of Warcraft' or 'Minecraft', otherwise I'd never get any work done.","I think it's a bit silly to brand the Internet as the 'downfall of youth.'","Personally, I'm kind of swirling in this hurricane of virtual reality because of 'Ready Player One.'","In a book, you can describe a scene and have any song you want playing on the radio and have any painting you want hanging on the wall. That was really freeing to me when I was writing 'Ready Player One.' I could throw in everything that I love.","Whenever I watch 'The Matrix,' I think that it is possible, but I don't think that it's going to be machines enslaving humans.","I noticed in the late 1990s that my friends and I were already nostalgic for the 1980s, and by the turn of the century, VH1's 'I Love the '80s' gave all of us an accelerated nostalgia for our generation.","Once the people of planet Earth are all hanging out together online in a virtual world without any borders, I think it could change social networking, entertainment and even politics.","I've never really collected anything other than old Atari cartridges. I only had, like, 12 Atari games as a kid, so at some point in my 20s I decided I was going to own all of them.","'Star Wars' was the mythology of my youth. I longed for adventure.","In a zombie apocalypse movie, nobody's ever seen a zombie movie. Or in an alien invasion movie, nobody has ever seen an alien invasion movie, like 'Independence Day.'","Everything you could ever want to happen happened to me when 'Ready Player One' came out.","I'm surprised that VR has come about so quickly. It's lucky I just happened to write a book imagining virtual reality right on the cusp of it actually happening.","I was 7 years old when the '80s began and 17 years old when they ended, so it was an incredibly formative decade for me.","I'm incredibly nostalgic for the '80s, because I think that's when Geek Culture really kicked in to high gear.","My favorite video game of all time is called 'Black Tiger'. It's a Capcom Dungeons and Dragons game from 1987. I have the actual arcade version sitting in my office.","Before I became a full-time writer, I worked in tech support in those giant cubicle farms you see. I was surrounded by people who played video games all the time - sometimes actually in the call centers, playing online multiplayer games. I saw friends of mine who began to feel that going online was more compelling to them than real life.","I feel like I was hit by all of geek culture at once while I was growing up in the '70s and '80s. Saturday morning cartoons like 'Star Blazers' and 'Robotech.' Live action Japanese shows like 'Ultraman' and 'The Space Giants.'","I spent most of my childhood welded to my Atari 2600, until I got my first computer, a TRS-80.","I've wanted to own a DeLorean since I was 10 years old, but it always seemed like a silly daydream. Like owning the 'A-Team' van or something.","I notice when I'm at a party where I don't know anybody - even if I have nothing in common with somebody - we can still talk because we were raised by the same TV and cartoons and movies.","For the whole history of cinema, we've been experiencing movies and television through a two-dimensional, letterboxed window. But once you can start programming entertainment for all the different senses, it becomes a wholly different medium.","Gibson wrote 'Neuromancer' on a typewriter, you know, before the technology he was writing about existed.","Now, a lot of early VR worlds or universes that are coming online take inspiration from 'Ready Player One.' It's just the coolest thing ever.","I was always obsessed with the 'Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai,' this weird little cult movie. There was this promised sequel before the end credits - 'Buckaroo Banzai Against the World Crime League' - and I knew instinctively they were never going to make that movie, because the first one had made, like, $8 at the box office.","'Fanboys' was the first real screenplay that I ever wrote that was an original story with my own characters.","I still tell people, 'I'm pretty sure I'm the only 'Star Wars' fan in history to ever break into Skywalker Ranch by writing a movie about breaking into Skywalker Ranch.'","VR really changes everything for flight because the old simulators for the PC were 2D, and you couldn't look around inside the cockpit and learn the controls or even track other planes through the cockpit.","I was standing on the shoulders of other science fiction writers like William Gibson, who had written 'Neuromancer' on a typewriter before home computers even really existed, and Neal Stephenson who wrote 'Snow Crash' in the early '90s and imagined an online virtual world before the birth of the modern Internet.","Growing up in rural Ohio, I knew my way around a double-wide pretty well.","I wanted to be able to write in the voice that I talk to my friends and assume that everybody would know what I was talking about.","When you're hanging out with your friends, you reference books and movies, and you don't always know if your friends know what you're referencing. But you throw it out there, and if it connects, it makes people laugh.","It's weird that, in a way, by writing about video games, I get to develop them, too.","I have such a vivid memory of seeing science fiction movies and going to the lobby and playing whatever the space games were, and imagine I was blowing up the Death Star.","I love stories like 'The Terminator' movies and 'The Matrix,' where our machines become self-aware and turn on us.","What's really astounding to me is a lot of the guys at Oculus VR and other companies who were creating VR tell me that 'Ready Player One' is one of their primary inspirations in getting into virtual reality.","I've been to Oculus a few times to do book signings and things there, and they tell me 'Ready Player One' is, like, required reading for new employees."],"Ernest Dimnet":["Ideas are the root of creation.","The happiness of most people is not ruined by great catastrophes or fatal errors, but by the repetition of slowly destructive little things.","Children have to be educated, but they have also to be left to educate themselves.","All serious conversations gravitate towards philosophy.","Americans cannot realize how many chances for mental improvement they lose by their inveterate habit of keeping six conversations when there are twelve in the room.","The history of the past interests us only in so far as it illuminates the history of the present.","Life is a succession of lessons enforced by immediate reward, or, oftener, by immediate chastisement.","Architecture, of all the arts, is the one which acts the most slowly, but the most surely, on the soul.","Education is the methodical creation of the habit of thinking.","Most people suspend their judgment till somebody else has expressed his own and then they repeat it.","A book, like a landscape, is a state of consciousness varying with readers."],"Ernest Dowson":["I understand that absinthe makes the tart grow fonder.","And I was desolate and sick of an old passion.","They are not long, the days of wine and roses."],"Ernest Gaines":["Why is it that, as a culture, we are more comfortable seeing two men holding guns than holding hands?","There will always be men struggling to change, and there will always be those who are controlled by the past.","Question everything. Every stripe, every star, every word spoken. Everything.","Words mean nothing. Action is the only thing. Doing. That's the only thing.","In the beginning, I tried to be a more cosmopolitan writer, but I realized that I was a country boy, and I had to deal with things I knew about and where I came from.","I think I'm a very religious person. I think I believe in God as much as any man does. I don't only believe in God, I know there's God.","The mark of fear is not easily removed.","Sometimes you got to hurt something to help something. Sometimes you have to plow under one thing in order for something else to grow.","A myth is an old lie that people believe in. White people believe that they're better than anyone else on earth - and that's a myth.","When I'm sitting in the church alone, I can hear singing of the old people. I can hear their singing and I can hear their praying, and sometimes I hum one of their songs.","I write to try to find out who I am. One of my main themes is manliness. I think I'm trying to figure out what manliness really is.","I was raised by a lady that was crippled all her life but she did everything for me and she raised me. She washed our clothes, cooked our food, she did everything for us. I don't think I ever heard her complain a day in her life. She taught me responsibility towards my brother and sisters and the community.","I suppose I started writing seriously at 16 years old. I thought I wrote a novel at 16 and sent it to New York! They sent it back because it wasn't novel.","Today I must write a paragraph or a page better than I did yesterday.","I wanted to be a writer. I wanted to say something about home.","I had to see and feel and be with the thing that I wanted to write about.","All writers write about the past, and I try to make it come alive so you can see what happened.","What I miss today more than anything else - I don't go to church as much anymore - but that old-time religion, that old singing, that old praying which I love so much. That is the great strength of my being, of my writing.","I knew I wanted to be a writer and I knew if I had a wife and family, I would neglect something, and I was afraid it wouldn't be the writing.","I write with as much objectivity as I can.","The sharecropper may lower his eyes, but not because he's less of a man. That's just a condition of society that such things exist.","I try to write something that would interest anybody and keep them turning the page. You must have a plot and good storyline.","I believe that the writer should tell a story. I believe in plot. I believe in creating characters and suspense.","Grace under pressure isn't just about bullfighters and men at war. It's about getting up every day to face a job or a white boss you don't like but have to face to feed your children so they'll grow up to be a better generation."],"Ernest Hello":["The man who gives up accomplishes nothing and is only a hindrance. The man who does not give up can move mountains.","The Holy Bible is an abyss. It is impossible to explain how profound it is, impossible to explain how simple it is.","There are men who would quickly love each other if once they were speak to each other; for when they spoke they would discover that their souls had only separated by phantoms and delusions."],"Ernest Hemingway":["The world breaks everyone, and afterward, some are strong at the broken places.","The best way to find out if you can trust somebody is to trust them.","An intelligent man is sometimes forced to be drunk to spend time with his fools.","There is nothing to writing. All you do is sit down at a typewriter and bleed.","I like to listen. I have learned a great deal from listening carefully. Most people never listen.","But man is not made for defeat. A man can be destroyed but not defeated.","I love sleep. My life has the tendency to fall apart when I'm awake, you know?","Always do sober what you said you'd do drunk. That will teach you to keep your mouth shut.","All things truly wicked start from innocence.","There is nothing noble in being superior to your fellow men. True nobility lies in being superior to your former self.","There is no friend as loyal as a book.","We are all apprentices in a craft where no one ever becomes a master.","Courage is grace under pressure.","Never go on trips with anyone you do not love.","From things that have happened and from things as they exist and from all things that you know and all those you cannot know, you make something through your invention that is not a representation but a whole new thing truer than anything true and alive, and you make it alive, and if you make it well enough, you give it immortality.","Never mistake motion for action.","The only thing that could spoil a day was people. People were always the limiters of happiness except for the very few that were as good as spring itself.","Happiness in intelligent people is the rarest thing I know.","There is no lonelier man in death, except the suicide, than that man who has lived many years with a good wife and then outlived her. If two people love each other there can be no happy end to it.","Time is the least thing we have of.","Why should anybody be interested in some old man who was a failure?","The first panacea for a mismanaged nation is inflation of the currency; the second is war. Both bring a temporary prosperity; both bring a permanent ruin. But both are the refuge of political and economic opportunists.","Never think that war, no matter how necessary, nor how justified, is not a crime.","They wrote in the old days that it is sweet and fitting to die for one's country. But in modern war, there is nothing sweet nor fitting in your dying. You will die like a dog for no good reason.","About morals, I know only that what is moral is what you feel good after and what is immoral is what you feel bad after.","When people talk, listen completely. Most people never listen.","For a true writer, each book should be a new beginning where he tries again for something that is beyond attainment. He should always try for something that has never been done or that others have tried and failed. Then sometimes, with great luck, he will succeed.","His talent was as natural as the pattern that was made by the dust on a butterfly's wings. At one time he understood it no more than the butterfly did and he did not know when it was brushed or marred.","Hesitation increases in relation to risk in equal proportion to age.","You can wipe out your opponents. But if you do it unjustly you become eligible for being wiped out yourself.","I'm not going to get into the ring with Tolstoy.","The good parts of a book may be only something a writer is lucky enough to overhear or it may be the wreck of his whole damn life and one is as good as the other.","Every man's life ends the same way. It is only the details of how he lived and how he died that distinguish one man from another.","There is no hunting like the hunting of man, and those who have hunted armed men long enough and liked it, never care for anything else thereafter.","The shortest answer is doing the thing.","I love to go to the zoo. But not on Sunday. I don't like to see the people making fun of the animals, when it should be the other way around.","I never had to choose a subject - my subject rather chose me.","If a writer knows enough about what he is writing about, he may omit things that he knows. The dignity of movement of an iceberg is due to only one ninth of it being above water.","If you are lucky enough to have lived in Paris as a young man, then wherever you go for the rest of your life it stays with you, for Paris is a moveable feast.","In modern war... you will die like a dog for no good reason.","All my life I've looked at words as though I were seeing them for the first time.","You're beautiful, like a May fly.","As you get older it is harder to have heroes, but it is sort of necessary.","Man is not made for defeat.","Prose is architecture, not interior decoration, and the Baroque is over.","All good books have one thing in common - they are truer than if they had really happened.","I rewrote the ending to 'Farewell to Arms,' the last page of it, thirty-nine times before I was satisfied.","That terrible mood of depression of whether it's any good or not is what is known as The Artist's Reward.","For a long time now I have tried simply to write the best I can. Sometimes I have good luck and write better than I can.","I learned never to empty the well of my writing, but always to stop when there was still something there in the deep part of the well, and let it refill at night from the springs that fed it.","You can write any time people will leave you alone and not interrupt you. Or, rather, you can if you will be ruthless enough about it. But the best writing is certainly when you are in love.","There are events which are so great that if a writer has participated in them his obligation is to write truly rather than assume the presumption of altering them with invention.","Once we have a war there is only one thing to do. It must be won. For defeat brings worse things than any that can ever happen in war.","I know now that there is no one thing that is true - it is all true.","Personal columnists are jackals and no jackal has been known to live on grass once he had learned about meat - no matter who killed the meat for him.","I wake up in the morning and my mind starts making sentences, and I have to get rid of them fast - talk them or write them down.","When I am working on a book or a story, I write every morning as soon after first light as possible. There is no one to disturb you, and it is cool or cold, and you come to your work and warm as you write.","The game of golf would lose a great deal if croquet mallets and billiard cues were allowed on the putting green.","You see, I am trying in all my stories to get the feeling of the actual life across - not to just depict life - or criticize it - but to actually make it alive. So that when you have read something by me, you actually experience the thing. You can't do this without putting in the bad and the ugly as well as what is beautiful.","What is moral is what you feel good after, and what is immoral is what you feel bad after.","Writing and travel broaden your ass if not your mind and I like to write standing up.","Somebody just back of you while you are fishing is as bad as someone looking over your shoulder while you write a letter to your girl.","To be a successful father... there's one absolute rule: when you have a kid, don't look at it for the first two years.","No weapon has ever settled a moral problem. It can impose a solution but it cannot guarantee it to be a just one.","There's no one thing that is true. They're all true.","My aim is to put down on paper what I see and what I feel in the best and simplest way.","The world is a fine place and worth the fighting for and I hate very much to leave it.","Things may not be immediately discernible in what a man writes, and in this sometimes he is fortunate; but eventually they are quite clear, and by these and the degree of alchemy that he possesses, he will endure or be forgotten.","A serious writer is not to be confounded with a solemn writer. A serious writer may be a hawk or a buzzard or even a popinjay, but a solemn writer is always a bloody owl.","For a war to be just three conditions are necessary - public authority, just cause, right motive.","That is what we are supposed to do when we are at our best - make it all up - but make it up so truly that later it will happen that way.","Certainly it is valuable to a trained writer to crash in an aircraft which burns. He learns several important things very quickly. Whether they will be of use to him is conditioned by survival. Survival, with honor, that outmoded and all-important word, is as difficult as ever and as all-important to a writer.","On the 'Star,' you were forced to learn to write a simple declarative sentence. This is useful to anyone. Newspaper work will not harm a young writer and could help him if he gets out of it in time.","When I have an idea, I turn down the flame, as if it were a little alcohol stove, as low as it will go. Then it explodes and that is my idea.","When writing a novel a writer should create living people; people not characters. A character is a caricature.","All modern American literature comes from one book by Mark Twain called Huckleberry Finn.","Once writing has become your major vice and greatest pleasure, only death can stop it.","Decadence is a difficult word to use since it has become little more than a term of abuse applied by critics to anything they do not yet understand or which seems to differ from their moral concepts.","Cowardice... is almost always simply a lack of ability to suspend functioning of the imagination.","Wars are caused by undefended wealth.","All our words from loose using have lost their edge.","Switzerland is a small, steep country, much more up and down than sideways, and is all stuck over with large brown hotels built on the cuckoo clock style of architecture.","It's none of their business that you have to learn how to write. Let them think you were born that way.","When you have shot one bird flying you have shot all birds flying. They are all different and they fly in different ways but the sensation is the same and the last one is as good as the first.","If you have a success you have it for the wrong reasons. If you become popular it is always because of the worst aspects of your work.","I know only that what is moral is what you feel good after and what is immoral is what you feel bad after.","A man's got to take a lot of punishment to write a really funny book.","Madame, all stories, if continued far enough, end in death, and he is no true-story teller who would keep that from you.","There is no rule on how to write. Sometimes it comes easily and perfectly; sometimes it's like drilling rock and then blasting it out with charges.","I know war as few other men now living know it, and nothing to me is more revolting. I have long advocated its complete abolition, as its very destructiveness on both friend and foe has rendered it useless as a method of settling international disputes.","I've tried to reduce profanity but I reduced so much profanity when writing the book that I'm afraid not much could come out. Perhaps we will have to consider it simply as a profane book and hope that the next book will be less profane or perhaps more sacred.","Pound's crazy. All poets are. They have to be. You don't put a poet like Pound in the loony bin.","After you finish a book, you know, you're dead. But no one knows you're dead. All they see is the irresponsibility that comes in after the terrible responsibility of writing.","When you go to war as a boy, you have a great illusion of immortality. Other people get killed, not you... Then, when you are badly wounded the first time, you lose that illusion, and you know it can happen to you.","A writer of fiction is really... a congenital liar who invents from his own knowledge or that of other men.","Fear of death increases in exact proportion to increase in wealth.","I don't like to write like God. It is only because you never do it, though, that the critics think you can't do it.","Ezra was right half the time, and when he was wrong, he was so wrong you were never in any doubt about it.","Bullfighting is the only art in which the artist is in danger of death and in which the degree of brilliance in the performance is left to the fighter's honor.","I always rewrite each day up to the point where I stopped. When it is all finished, naturally you go over it. You get another chance to correct and rewrite when someone else types it, and you see it clean in type. The last chance is in the proofs. You're grateful for these different chances.","'For Whom the Bell Tolls' was a problem which I carried on each day. I knew what was going to happen in principle. But I invented what happened each day I wrote."],"Ernest Holmes":["Life is a mirror and will reflect back to the thinker what he thinks into it.","Prayer is a thought, a belief, a feeling, arising within the mind of the one praying.","Borrowing knowledge of reality from all sources, taking the best from every study, Science of Mind brings together the highest enlightenment of the ages.","But even in the Christian religion, much of its real meaning is hidden by words that are misleading and symbols that but few understand.","When prayer removes distrust and doubt and enters the field of mental certainty, it becomes faith; and the universe is built on faith.","The universal Mind contains all knowledge. It is the potential ultimate of all things. To it, all things are possible.","Each one of us is an outlet to God and an inlet to God.","The road to freedom lies not through mysteries or occult performances, but through the intelligent use of natural forces and laws.","Teach and practice, practice and teach - that is all we have; that is all we are good for; that is all we ever ought to do.","We can no more do without spirituality than we can do without food, shelter, or clothing.","To believe in a just law of cause and effect, carrying with it a punishment or a reward, is to believe in righteousness.","God gives some more than others because some accept more than others.","The universe must exist for the self-expression of God and the delight of God.","There was a time when a man was so convinced that the world was round that he was determined to prove it.","I do not believe that God has imposed suffering upon anyone to punish them or to teach them a lesson.","In principle the great religions of the world do not differ as much as they appear to.","The intellect is a cold thing and a merely intellectual idea will never stimulate thought in the same manner that a spiritual idea does."],"Ernest Istook":["There are many alternatives to embryonic stem cell research, alternatives with great potential. We need to support these and oppose creating life for the sole purpose of destroying it.","Our economic freedom is founded on individual property rights; government should never be permitted to take those away.","America's strength is not our diversity; our strength is our ability to unite people of different backgrounds around common principles. A common language is necessary to reach that goal.","My father was the son of immigrants, and he grew up bilingual, but English is what my father taught me and what he spoke to me. America's strength is not our diversity; it is our ability to unite around common principles even when we come from different backgrounds.","The motives of these parents vary, many parents don't like the curriculum being taught to their kids, or are wary of the threat of peer pressure or the presence of drugs or violence lurking in too many of our schools today.","We've outpaced Japan and Europe in creating new jobs, but there's major competition from India and China. It's not enough to make income tax cuts permanent.","We need uniform protection of traditional marriage. You can't have different definitions on something as fundamental as marriage. The Marriage Protection Amendment is the only solution to this problem.","We cannot sacrifice innocent human life now for vague and exaggerated promises of medical treatments thirty of forty years from now. There are ways to pursue this technology and respect life at the same time.","To become an American citizen, we require people to read, write and speak in English. That is to help them to assimilate in our melting pot, truly to become Americans. We mock that when the cherished right to vote does not involve English any more.","Thousands of present day students, like many of our Founding Fathers, are being taught at home.","Those people who want to express their religious beliefs on public property should enjoy the same rights that we provide to those protesting the war in Iraq.","There's a lot of exaggerated talk about CAFTA, but it's actually a fairly routine trade agreement. Although it involves fairly small nations, they're still more important trade partners than places like Australia or many other larger nations.","There are a lot of Grinches out there that would like nothing better than to take any references to religion out of the holiday season.","The courts are using the First Amendment to attack religion, when they should be using it to protect religion.","The birth of democracy in Iraq is one of the great positive changes of our era.","The American people do not want people thumbing their nose at the law. It undercuts the very fabric of our society and the system of civil justice and of criminal justice as well.","Research and development needs permanent tax credits to build the technology that spurs our growth. But no government programs alone can get America's students to study more science and math; parents must push and help their children to meet this goal.","Printing ballots in multiple languages costs millions of dollars every year. It also discourages immigrants from integrating into American society and gaining the benefits that come from speaking English.","Out of control judicial activism threatens traditional marriage in America.","It's good that the first half of the speech emphasized freedom, because George W. Bush has been the global champion for freedom. As he said, if we don't fight tyranny it will not leave us alone in peace.","Instead of this confusion, we need the unifying force of an official language, English, which is the language of success in America.","I think it's awful that the state of Oklahoma a couple of years ago passed this law to give the same tuition to illegals as they do to people who are residents of Oklahoma. I think it's wrong.","I remind everyone: Whether you school them at home or send them to school, you as a parent have the responsibility to make sure they learn and behave. Teachers and principals may help, but parents are the ones who must accept responsibility.","Home schooled children frequently combine for many purposes - and they interact well. The growth of the home schooling movement means that more and more children are learning together, just not in a traditional classroom.","English should be our official language. Reading and speaking English are requirements to become a citizen.","Education begins at home and I applaud the parents who recognize that they - not someone else - must take responsibility to assure that their children are well educated.","Americans should be free to recognize our religious heritage; doing that is not the same as creating a government-sponsored religion.","America has global trade with plenty of nations that provide inexpensive labor, but it's better for us when they're in our own hemisphere, rather than sending that business halfway around the world."],"Ernest Lawrence":["Let us cherish the hope that the day is not far distant when we will be in the midst of this next adventure.","For it goes without saying that this great recognition at this time will aid tremendously our efforts to find the necessarily large funds for the next voyage of exploration farther into the depths of the atom.","No individual is alone responsible for a single stepping stone along the path of progress, and where the path is smooth progress is most rapid.","The day when the scientist, no matter how devoted, may make significant progress alone and without material help is past. This fact is most self-evident in our work.","In the Radiation Laboratory we count it a privilege to do everything we can to assist our medical colleagues in the application of these new tools to the problems of human suffering.","I have suggested that scientific progress requires a favorable environment.","From the beginning of the Radiation Laboratory, I have had the rare good fortune of being in the center of a group of men of high ability, enthusiastic and completely devoted to scientific pursuits.","Instead of an attic with a few test tubes, bits of wire and odds and ends, the attack on the atomic nucleus has required the development and construction of great instruments on an engineering scale.","Certainly, it may bring to light such a deeper knowledge of the structure of matter as to constitute a veritable discontinuity in the progress of science."],"Ernest Lehman":["After all, the wool of a black sheep is just as warm.","There's nothing more irresistible to a man than a woman who's in love with him."],"Ernest Mandel":["Marxism is always open, always critical, always self-critical.","And you cannot have a socialist revolution commandeered from the top, ordered around by some omniscient leader or group of leaders.","The only conclusion you can draw from the real historical movement is that by and large, in day-to-day life, what Lenin called trade union consciousness dominates the working class. I would call it elementary class consciousness of the working class.","Factions are a sign of illness in a party.","You cannot make a socialist revolution without really trying.","Periodically, the workers do revolt against bourgeois society, not by a hundred, five hundred, or a thousand, but by the millions.","There has been hardly a single year since 1917, and in a certain sense since 1905, without a revolution somewhere in the world in which the workers participated in a rather important way.","The conclusion you can draw from these characteristics is that you have an uneven development of class activity and an uneven development of class consciousness in the working class.","Workers do not strike every day, they cannot do that the way they function in the capitalist economy. The way they have to live by selling their labor power makes that impossible.","You can have relatively high levels of class consciousness with a lower level of class militancy than one would have expected.","You need a vanguard organization in order to overcome the dangerous potential brought about by the uneven development of class militancy and class consciousness.","I do not believe in self-proclaimed parties.","There is a process of social and of political differentiation going on in the real working class all the time.","Only under conditions of revolutionary crises do you have the highest level of self-organization; this is the Soviet type of organization, which is to say, workers' councils, people's councils, call them what you want, popular committees.","Furthermore, there is absolutely no contradiction between the separate organizations of revolutionary vanguard militants and their participation in the mass organizations of the working class.","On the contrary, history generally confirms that the more conscious and the better you are organized in vanguard organizations, the more constructively you operate in the mass organizations of the working class.","There are no conditions in which we subordinate the interests of the class as a whole to the interests of any sect, any chapel, any separate organization.","We do not believe that the Marxist program, which embodies the continuity of the experience of the actual class struggle and real revolutions of the last one hundred and fifty years, is a definitely closed book.","For us, Marxism is always open because there are always new xperiences, there are always new facts, including facts about the past, which have to be incorporated in the corpus of scientific socialism.","Revolution is not a goal in itself.","Revolution is an instrument, like a party is an instrument.","Socialist democracy is not, a luxury and its need is not limited to the most advanced industrial countries.","Mistakes in themselves are unavoidable.","The more workers you have in your organization, the better you are implanted in the working class, the more likely you are to come up with the concrete problems of the class.","Otherwise we get off the track and we do not fulfil the historical role which we want to fulfil: to help the masses, the exploited and the oppressed of the world, build a classless society, a world socialist federation."],"Ernest Newman":["Beethoven, Wagner, Bach, and Mozart settled down day after day to the job in hand. They didn't waste time waiting for inspiration.","The great composer does not set to work because he is inspired, but becomes inspired because he is working.","The higher the voice the smaller the intellect."],"Ernest Poole":["All the real things in Russia are done in the villages.","Here we grow the flax and grain; here we raise the meat they eat, and the wool to keep them warm; we cut trees to build their houses and firewood to heat their stoves.","The trouble with those people is that they think all the best things are made in the cities. It is not so.","What kind of crops do they raise in the towns? Only Grand Dukes, Bolsheviks and drunkards!"],"Ernest Renan":["All history is incomprehensible without Christ.","Communism is in conflict with human nature.","No idea can succeed except at the expense of sacrifice; no one ever escapes without enduring strain from the struggle of life.","The liberty of the individual is a necessary postulate of human progress.","You may take great comfort from the fact that suffering inwardly for the sake of truth proves abundantly that one loves it and marks one out as being of the elect.","The simplest schoolboy is now familiar with truths for which Archimedes would have sacrificed his life.","Religion is not a popular error; it is a great instinctive truth, sensed by the people, expressed by the people.","As a rule, all heroism is due to a lack of reflection, and thus it is necessary to maintain a mass of imbeciles. If they once understand themselves the ruling men will be lost.","Man makes holy what he believes.","To conceive the good, in fact, is not sufficient; it must be made to succeed among men. To accomplish this less pure paths must be followed.","When people complain of life, it is almost always because they have asked impossible things of it.","The greatest men of a nation are those it puts to death.","I can die when I wish to: that is my elixir of life.","All the great things of humanity have been accomplished in the name of absolute principles.","Our opinions become fixed at the point where we stop thinking.","Let us remember that sorrow alone is the creator of great things.","He whom God has touched will always be a being apart: he is, whatever he may do, a stranger among men; he is marked by a sign.","In morals, truth is but little prized when it is a mere sentiment, and only attains its full value when realized in the world as fact.","Blessed are the blind, for they know not enough to ask why.","God, if there is a God, take my soul, if I have a soul."],"Ernest Rutherford":["If your experiment needs statistics, you ought to have done a better experiment.","All science is either physics or stamp collecting.","Of all created comforts, God is the lender; you are the borrower, not the owner.","You should never bet against anything in science at odds of more than about 1012 to 1."],"Ernest Shackleton":["Difficulties are just things to overcome, after all.","Now my eyes are turned from the South to the North, and I want to lead one more Expedition. This will be the last... to the North Pole.","Superhuman effort isn't worth a damn unless it achieves results.","We had seen God in His splendors, heard the text that Nature renders. We had reached the naked soul of man.","I called to the other men that the sky was clearing, and then a moment later I realized that what I had seen was not a rift in the clouds but the white crest of an enormous wave.","I seemed to vow to myself that some day I would go to the region of ice and snow and go on and on till I came to one of the poles of the earth, the end of the axis upon which this great round ball turns.","After months of want and hunger, we suddenly found ourselves able to have meals fit for the gods, and with appetites the gods might have envied.","If I had not some strength of will I would make a first class drunkard.","The noise resembles the roar of heavy, distant surf. Standing on the stirring ice one can imagine it is disturbed by the breathing and tossing of a mighty giant below."],"Ernest Thompson Seton":["At this camp I had the unique experience of showing all these seasoned Westerners that it was possible to make a fire by the friction of two sticks. This has long been a specialty of mine; I use a thong and a bow as the simplest way.","The ancient feud between cat and dog is not forgotten in the north, for the Lynx is the deadly foe of the Fox and habitually kills it when there is soft snow and scarcity of easier prey.","There are no Rabbits in the north-west. This statement, far from final, is practically true today, but I saw plenty of Lynxes, and one cannot write of ducks without mentioning water.","I believe that natural history has lost much by the vague general treatment that is so common.","All travellers who had preceded me into the Barren Grounds had relied on the abundant game, and in consequence suffered dreadful hardships; in some cases even starved to death.","At each of these northern posts there were interesting experiences in store for me, as one who had read all the books of northern travel and dreamed for half a lifetime of the north; and that was - almost daily meeting with famous men.","Fort Smith, being the place of my longest stay, was the scene of my largest medical practice.","I have only one prejudice in horseflesh - I do not like a white one.","On the 27th we came to the Cascade Rapids. The first or Little Cascade has about two feet fall, the second or Grand Cascade, a mile farther, is about a six foot sheer drop.","The Hudson's Bay Company has always been the guardian angel of the north.","The name Peace River itself is the monument of a successful effort on the part of the Company to bring about a better understanding between the Crees and the Beavers.","The white spruce forest along the banks is most inspiring, magnificent here. Down the terraced slopes and right to the water's edge on the alluvial soil it stands in ranks.","Though so trifling, the success of our first Buffalo hunt gave us quite a social lift.","We were now back at Smith Landing, and fired with a desire to make another Buffalo expedition on which we should have ampler time and cover more than a mere corner of the range."],"Ernest Walton":["A linear accelerator has the advantage that no magnet is required and that its cost should not rise much more steeply than with the energy of the particles required.","The discovery that light elements could be disintegrated by artificially accelerated particles gave an additional impetus to development work on the various methods of producing them.","As the size of cyclotrons increases and faster particles are produced, a difficulty arises due to the relativistic increase of mass of the particle.","I wish to thank the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences very sincerely for the great honour they have done me. It is an honour so great that even yet it is difficult for me to believe that it is true.","The high esteem in which the Nobel Prizes are held is undoubtedly due to the conscientious way in which the Committees have discharged a heavy responsibility.","Particles were coming out of the lithium, hitting the screen, and producing scintillations. They looked like stars suddenly appearing and disappearing."],"Ernestine Rose":["It is high time to compel man by the might of right to give woman her political, legal and social rights. She will find her own sphere in accordance with her capacities, powers and tastes; and yet she will be woman still.","If any difference should be made by law between husband and wife, reason, justice and humanity, if their voices were heard, would dictate that it should be in her favor.","If you allow one single germ, one single seed of slavery to remain in the soil of America... that germ will spring up, that noxious weed will thrive, and again stifle the growth, wither the leaves, blast the flowers and poison the fair fruits of freedom.","Carry out the republican principle of universal suffrage, or strike it from your banners and substitute 'Freedom and Power to one half of society, and Submission and Slavery to the other.'","It is an interesting and demonstrable fact, that all children are atheists and were religion not inculcated into their minds, they would remain so.","Agitate! Agitate! Ought to be the motto of every reformer. Agitation is the opposite of stagnation - the one is life, the other death.","Again, I shall be told that the law presumes the husband to be kind, affectionate, and ready to provide for and protect his wife. But what right, I ask, has the law to presume at all on the subject?","Cultivate the frontal portion of her brain as much as that of man is cultivated, and she will stand his equal at least. Even now, where her mind has been called out at all, her intellect is as bright, as capacious, and as powerful as his.","The main cause is a pernicious falsehood propagated against her being, namely that she is inferior by her nature. Inferior in what? What has man ever done that woman, under the same advantages could not do?","Away with that folly that her rights would be detrimental to her character - that if she were recognized as the equal to a man she would cease to be a woman!","Slavery and freedom cannot exist together.","She had her reward! - that reward of which no enemie could deprive her, which no slanders could make less precious - the eternal reward of knowing that she had done her duty.","When a man comes to me and tries to convince me that he is not a thief, then I take care of my coppers.","I asked God if it was a sin and He didn't say anything.","If God is pleased in making you sick and unhappy, I hate God.","Emancipation from every kind of bondage is my principle. I go for recognition of human rights, without distinction of sect, party, sex, or color.","No! on Human Rights and Freedom, on a subject that is as self-evident as that two and two make four, there is no need of any written authority.","Books and opinions, no matter from whom they came, if they are in opposition to human rights, are nothing but dead letters.","All that I can tell you is, that I used my humble powers to the uttermost, and raised my voice in behalf of Human Rights in general, and the elevation and Rights of Woman in particular, nearly all my life.","I suppose you all grant that woman is a human being. If she has a right to life she has a right to earn a support for that life. If a human being, she has a right to have her powers and faculties as a human being developed. If developed, she has a right to exercise them.","Blind submission in women is considered a virtue, while submission to wrong is itself wrong, and resistance to wrong is virtue alike in women as in man.","But it will be said that the husband provides for the wife, or in other words, he feeds, clothes and shelters her! I wish I had the power to make every one before me fully realize the degradation contained in that idea.","But say some, would you expose woman to the contact of rough, rude, drinking, swearing, fighting men at the ballot box? What a humiliating confession lies in this plea for keeping woman in the background!","Do you not yet understand what has made woman what she is? Then see what the sickly taste and perverted judgment of man now admires in woman.","Fathers like to have children good-natured, well-behaved, and comfortable, but how to put them in that desirable condition is out of their philosophy.","From the cradle to the grave she is subject to the power and control of man. Father, guardian, or husband, one conveys her like some piece of merchandise over to the other.","I know that some endeavor to throw the mantle of romance over the subject and treat woman like some ideal existence, not liable to the ills of life. Let those deal in fancy who have nothing better to deal in; we have to do with sober, sad realities, with stubborn facts.","If they are unsuccessful in married life, who suffers more the bitter consequences of poverty than the wife? But if successful, she has not a dollar to call her own.","In case of separation, why should the children be taken from the protecting care of the mother? Who has a better right to them than she? How much do fathers generally do toward bringing them up?","In the laws of the land, she has no rights; in government she has no voice. And in spite of another principle recognized in this Republic, namely, that 'taxation without representation is tyranny,' she is taxed without being represented.","Much is said about the burdens and responsibilities of married men. Responsibilities indeed there are, if they but felt them: but as to burdens what are they?","The few bright meteors in man's intellectual horizon could well be matched by women, were she allowed to occupy the same elevated position.","The mass of the people commence life with no other capital than the union of head, hearts and hands. To the benefit of this best of capital the wife has no right.","There is no reason against woman's elevation, but prejudices.","We have hardly an adequate idea how all-powerful law is in forming public opinion, in giving tone and character to the mass of society.","Why should women not be a martyr for her cause?"],"Ernesto Bertarelli":["You can't change who you are, but you can change what you have in your head, you can refresh what you're thinking about, you can put some fresh air in your brain.","If you have a life which is adrenaline-charged all week long because you're a powerful CEO, or you have responsibilities and you're committed to the people you look after, it's very difficult on weekends to sit around the garden. So you probably look for something which gives you the same sort of adrenaline buzz.","My father was a sailor and our summer vacations were always on a sailboat. I had a little boat before I had a moped.","I always thought that it's important to have other things, not just work, and I often even suggested my managers take some time off and come back fresh and ready to fight again.","I really enjoy sailing on Lake Geneva because I can just look at the shore and see my wife having a barbecue with the kids."],"Ernesto Teodoro Moneta":["The more each nation contributes to world society from the wealth of its own aptitudes, its own race, and its own traditions, the greater the future development and happiness of mankind will be.","I am a member of the Peace Society because I was a soldier: because I have fought and seen what war is like from personal experience. It was on the battlefield that I pledged myself to the cause of peace.","The concept that flourished during the most glorious periods of republican Rome and that appeared in the Twelve Tables of the Law as one of the first, though as yet imperfect, affirmations of the rights of man, inspired the struggle between patricians and plebeians.","No one painted a more accurate picture of military depredation than Vergil. Inspired though he was by the Latin spirit and by his pride in Rome, he nevertheless glorified Rome's true mission as one of providing the world with the rules of peace and justice.","Reasonable ideas which find their sanction in the conscience of the righteous do not die; they are consequently realities and active forces, but they are so only to the extent that those who profess them know how to turn them to account.","The Italian Revolution was fought first of all to obtain the liberty and unity of the nation, and then, with that achieved, to join the freest and most advanced nations in inaugurating a new era of peace, justice, and joint cooperation in the work of civilization."],"Ernie Banks":["Loyalty and friendship, which is to me the same, created all the wealth that I've ever thought I'd have.","My theme is, 'The spirit of friendship is the balance of life.' Not money. Not the World Series. It's friendship. The relationships I have with people, that's enough to keep me happy.","Everybody believed you had to have a big piece of lumber and then muscle the ball over the fence. But by the time I and Hank Aaron - another guy who did it with his wrists - were through, there were a lot of guys ordering light bats and playing handball.","It's a beautiful day for a ballgame... Let's play two!","When you do things to try to help people and share things, it really comes back to you. I try to do that.","You must try to generate happiness within yourself. If you aren't happy in one place, chances are you won't be happy anyplace.","It's a great day for a ball game; let's play two!","The riches of the game are in the thrills, not the money.","My long-range mission is to be the first athlete to win the Nobel Prize.","Work? I never worked a day in my life. I always loved what I was doing, had a passion for it.","I don't try to hit home runs. I just try to meet the ball and get base hits.","The only way to prove that you're a good sport is to lose.","Awards mean a lot, but they don't say it all. The people in baseball mean more to me than statistics.","Some people feel that because you are black you will never be treated fairly, and that you should voice your opinions, be militant about them. I don't feel this way. You can't convince a fool against his will.","Did you hear that? I didn't hear anything. Put that question another way.","I like my players to be married and in debt. That's the way you motivate them.","The Cubs are due in sixty-two.","No, I think the pitching today has more depth.","During my time, there might have been one pitcher or two that were top pitchers on a team. Teams that won maybe had three, but today they have a lot of depth. They have a lot of long relievers, short relievers, and the strategy is different.","It would be a lot different for me because there is a lot of information that you need to know about as a player. How pitchers are pitching you, how defenses are playing, certain situations about certain pitchers.","I learned from Mr. Wrigley, early in my career, that loyalty wins and it creates friendships. I saw it work for him in his business.","When I wake up in the morning, I feel like a billionaire without paying taxes.","Mr. Wrigley believed in this: Put all your eggs in one basket and watch the basket. They don't do that today. This is the old-fashioned way I'm talking about. He carried it on to his business. Do one thing and stay with it.","But it all comes down to friendship, treating people right.","I own stock, and I also insure my car with Geico.","People ask me a lot about the values I got from playing for the Cubs for so many years. The value I got out of it was patience. A lot of people these days are not very patient.","Another friend hired me to open doors for him in the moving and relocation business. I did that for 10 years, am still doing it. And I do some work for the Cubs, in community relations.","It's a kind of philosophy of my own life, to create the energy enough to keep on going.","The Cubs are gonna shine in sixty-nine.","I don't think it's up to black athletes to get involved in political or racial issues.","I guess my critics say, 'He must be crazy. Nothing can be that beautiful.' But when you think that there are so many people around the world who have nothing, you realize how lucky you are to be making a living in the big leagues.","We lived near a supermarket, and whatever they threw away, we would get it, and my mother would make soup. Or she would get a big can of lard, a big can of meal, a big can of flour, a big can of beans, and fix the same meal for months.","I hit a home run in my first game, and they told me to go into the stands and pass my cap around. I made six dollars in nickels, dimes, and quarters.","I wanted to finish my career with one team, in one city, one mayor, one park, one owner. I did that. The Wrigleys owned the team. We played all of our home games at Wrigley Field during the daytime. So my career was very unique, and I am proud of it.","I'd like to get to the last game of the World Series at Wrigley Field and hit three homers. That was what I always wanted to do.","I thought talking to human beings was just something that could make things complicated and unpleasant. So I didn't talk much. I just watched people.","I didn't understand anything about playing baseball. I started playing, and it was enjoyable. Most of my life, I played with older people on my team, in my league. I learned a lot about life. Every day in my life, I learned something new from somebody.","Playing for the Kansas City Monarchs was like my school, my learning, my world. It was my whole life.","I meet a lot of people that grew up with my career and have retired, and I just want to talk to them. I like to get a feeling from them, a feeling of the old times.","It was about 105 degrees in Chicago. And that's a time when everybody gets tired. I came into the clubhouse, and everybody was sitting around, and I said, 'Beautiful day. Let's play two!' And everybody looked at me like I was crazy. There were a couple of writers around, and they wrote that, and it stayed with me."],"Ernie Els":["Mondays are a good day to make statements, not Friday.","I have to believe that if I keep doing what I'm doing, the results will reflect that, and I'll give myself plenty more opportunities to win.","It is just a crazy life as a sportsman. My daughter, Sam, wants to go into tennis, and I tell her, 'No, you don't want to go into professional sport.'","I've got my life. I'm very serious about my business. I've got my family. And I've got my game.","Before you take your address, while you're still reading the putt, imagine the ball tracking on the line you've chosen and falling into the cup. If you don't believe you can make every putt, why bother trying?","When I'm swinging the club at my best, it's because I'm not thinking about mechanics at all. I feel like my body is loose. My arms are soft in front of me when I'm setting up, and my chest and shoulders feel as if they can move and turn easily.","If you can hit your 3- and 5-woods with confidence from the fairway, par 5s become birdie opportunities, and 420-yard par 4s are a lot less scary.","There's so much more to life than golf. Family is always first.","I use a 1994 South African 5 rand coin to mark my ball. It reminds me of my '94 U.S. Open win at Oakmont.","You have to know how to read your lie and take a calculated risk when you hit out of the rough.","For all the fun, don't forget: I always knew when to put my golf balls down and practice.","There have been so many majors that got away, starting at Riviera in '95, taking a three-shot lead into the final round of the PGA and not winning.","When I stay athletic with good posture and get the club away in a good position, I get through it better.","I never thought I'd be comfortable living outside South Africa, but we love London. Our two kids were born here.","You don't have to be long off the tee, and we know the amazing effect an Open crowd can have if you're on your game and how they can lift you.","I'd like to win the Masters and the PGA and complete the career Grand Slam.","I'm sure you have a hole at your course where you love to hit the tee shot. You can't wait to get up there and bomb away because the fairway is wide, or the hole always plays downwind.","Make a conscious effort to loosen your hands and let your arms feel soft when you're at address. Take the club back a bit shorter, and feel as if you're cracking a whip on the way down - not tensing up to smash something hard.","Your longest drives will come when you feel you're swinging at 75 percent.","Throughout my career, I've been sponsored by several different equipment companies - Lynx, Titleist, Callaway.","Something I've really enjoyed learning more about is course design.","Unless it's a dead-straight short putt, you should focus on a spot somewhere along the line you want to roll the ball on.","You should never get set over the ball and then aim your putter face. If you do it in that order, you can easily lose sight of your intended line. Instead, aim the face down your line first, then settle your body into position.","Right before I start the putter back, I think about making solid contact. This brings your attention to the back of the ball and helps keep your head still at impact, which is a must. Many amateurs take a peek down the line too soon, and that can cause all sorts of mis-hits.","In 2002, the 2000 Engelbrecht Els wine was released in South Africa and received high ratings.","I prefer old-world wines like Lafite Rothschild and Margaux.","Spin is a tricky thing. When you're trying to avoid it - say, on a tee shot, where sidespin puts you in the trees - it's easy to make it happen.","The biggest mistake is trying to pinch down on the ball and ripping out a big divot, often hitting the ground before the ball. You'll dig up some turf, but you won't create much backspin.","The good kind of spin - backspin - comes from hitting the ball cleanly, then making a divot after impact.","For the average player, most three-putts happen because of a poorly judged first putt from long range.","Contours on the second half of a long putt have more impact on how the ball rolls because it's going slower. Adjust your speed if that last part is playing uphill or downhill. Don't get fooled by an early slope or break.","You probably don't hit as many fairway-bunker shots as you do the greenside ones, and that unfamiliarity might make you a bit nervous.","From a good lie in the middle of a fairway bunker, I'll make the same swing as I do from an average fairway lie. I'll dig my feet in slightly and keep my lower body stable so I won't slip, but I don't change my club selection or setup. It's only when the ball is sitting down in the sand that I'll make some modifications.","The key is to hit the ball first, then the sand. Even if you catch it a bit thin, you'll still get plenty of run. Hitting it fat is what you want to avoid.","For the most part, when you play a full shot from the primary rough at your course, you're gauging how close to a standard shot you can hit based on your lie in the grass.","From the rough, I'd use a 6-iron, play the ball back an inch or two and swing down on a steeper angle to catch the ball first. It also helps to aim slightly left and open the clubface at address. You'll get more height on the shot, and the club will cut through the grass more easily.","Playing from deep grass is a fact of life in professional golf.","Because of the grass and open face, I take one more club for shots from the rough, unless the ball is sitting on top of dry grass. Then, I use more loft and swing softer, trying to hit it about 70 percent to avoid a flyer over the green.","When you get to the tee on a really long par 5, I know what you're feeling. You want to let the shaft out on the driver and try to bomb it down there. I get the same feeling. But a big tee shot is not always the best strategy, especially on a long hole.","I plot the par 5s back from the green and make my plan. If I can reach the green in two shots, I'm going to be aggressive off the tee. But if 's a three-shot hole, the goal changes. You want to put yourself in position to hit your favorite shot to the green.","I think most amateurs dread playing a 180-plus-yard par 3 even more than a hard par 4. Part of it is psychological: You think you should be getting a breather, distance-wise, and instead, you get hit with a long iron or hybrid shot over trouble.","Swinging harder with a longer club almost always leads to bad shots.","Check the card before you play. If you have a couple of long par 3s, put an extra hybrid in your bag. You'll be glad you did.","Brushing up on your short game at the practice area is fine and good, but taking it with you to the golf course - when your score is really on the line - is another story.","During a tournament, I'm not thinking about mechanics at all. I'm in scoring mode.","Grip pressure - not mechanical flaws - is the biggest factor when you're nervous. You unconsciously grip it tighter, which keeps you from making a smooth swing with a natural release. Keep your grip pressure light, and you'll be surprised how much your mechanics stabilize.","Some players like to change clubs around the green to hit high or low shots. I play all of my short-game shots with my 54-degree sand wedge and change my ball position to hit it higher or lower. I think it's easier to learn one club than four.","Ball position is everything in iron play. If you aren't careful about it, you can create some major problems in your game just by getting an inch or two off.","One of my tendencies is to let the ball drift too far forward in my stance, and it's something I've been working on with David Leadbetter.","For a 7-iron, you never want the ball to be closer to your left heel than just slightly ahead of the mid-point of your stance. That's especially true if you're a tall player, like me.","With shorter clubs, your ball position should be just back of middle, to really promote hitting the ball first on a downward strike.","I almost never hit a shot all out, and I make a conscious effort to swing my long clubs just as I do my wedges. Keep this in mind when hitting your fairway woods.","When you're hitting a fairway wood, you've got a lot of real estate to cover to get to your target. Your first instinct is probably to give it a little more power because you're worried about coming up short."],"Ernie Fletcher":["Education is our greatest opportunity to give an irrevocable gift to the next generation.","I would like this to be a new day. I would hope now that we can focus on doing the people's business.","State government has too often been used to look out for the insiders and not the citizens. This has insulated poverty from progress, and need from remedy.","Government cannot do everything, so we need to first decide what government ought to be doing, then figure out what it's capable of doing, and then follow the jobs we choose to completion.","This foundational principle - that human beings derive their rights from God, rather than from the State, or any other source - is what made America different.","A government of, for and by the people, requires much from the people.","My vision for Kentucky is a Commonwealth where there is so much economic opportunity, and our quality of life is so high, that people who are born here can stay here, and people who aren't fortunate enough to be born in Kentucky, can look forward to locating here.","We will attract more people to Kentucky by lowering our income tax rate. In fact, lowering the income tax rate is the single most important thing we can do to create opportunity.","Whenever I am among my fellow Governors, I am struck by how many face the same education improvement issues.","I cannot allow state government to continue to be consumed by this game of political 'gotcha.'"],"Ernie Harwell":["It's time to say goodbye, but I think goodbyes are sad and I'd much rather say hello. Hello to a new adventure.","Baseball is a lot like life. It's a day-to-day existence, full of ups and downs. You make the most of your opportunities in baseball as you do in life.","I look on life as a joyous adventure.","In radio, they say, nothing happens until the announcer says it happens.","Everybody we meet has an influence on us and an impact - good or bad. And I think that's why we have to be careful with the way we handle people because what we're doing is making an impact.","What happens with any announcer when he comes into an area, if he stays four or five years and does a fairly decent job, people accept him and he becomes part of the family.","Whatever happens, I'm ready to face it.","I've found that if you wear a beret, people think you're either a cabdriver or a producer of dirty movies.","I praise the Lord here today. I know that all my talent and all my ability comes from him, and without him I'm nothing and I thank him for his great blessing.","In baseball, democracy shines its clearest. The only race that matters is the race to the bag. The creed is the rule book. And color, merely something to distinguish one team's uniform from another's.","Baseball just a came as simple as a ball and bat. Yet, as complex as the American spirit it symbolizes. A sport, a business and sometimes almost even a religion.","Also I'm a part of the people that I've worked with in baseball that have been so great to me, Mr. Earl Mann of Atlanta, who gave me my first baseball broadcasting job.","When I went to Brooklyn in 1948 Jackie Robinson was at the height of his brilliant career.","Baseball is a tongue-tied kid from Georgia growing up to be an announcer and praising the Lord for showing him the way to Cooperstown. This is a game for America. Still a game for America, this baseball!","I have a great faith in God and Jesus.","I deeply appreciate the people of Michigan. I love their grit. I love the way they face life. I love the family values they have.","I just have faith. It's just there. It's not any big deal.","That other saying, I'm a part of all that I have met, I think that would have to begin with my wonderful parents back in Atlanta when I was a youngster five years old I was tongue tied.","The game's the thing. That's why people tune in. They don't tune in to hear an announcer.","It isn't me that people love. It's baseball.","The best thing anyone can do is be himself. Everyone was made different by God, and that's the way it should be. And if I were a writer or an announcer starting out, I don't think I'd imitate anybody. I'd try to be whatever I am.","I know that Jesus is in charge; he's walking with me.","A tall, thin old man waving a scorecard from the corner of his dugout. That's baseball.","But most of all, I'm a part of you people out there who have listened to me, because especially you people in Michigan, you Tiger fans, you've given me so much warmth, so much affection and so much love.","God blessed me by putting me here for thirty-one years at Michigan and Trumbull.","I love what I do. If I had my time over again, I'd probably do it for nothing.","I think I owe thanks to the people who have listened to me over the years, who tuned in on the radio. They have given me a warmth and loyalty that I've never been able to repay. The way they have reached out to me has certainly been the highlight of my life.","I'd like to be remembered as someone who showed up for the job. I consider myself a worker.","I've been lucky to broadcast some great events and to broadcast the exploits of some great players.","If I walked back into the booth in the year 2025, I don't think it would have changed much. I think baseball would be played and managed pretty much the same as it is today. It's a great survivor.","With the Giants I broadcast the debut of Hall of Famer Willie Mays.","In my almost 92 years on this earth, the good Lord has blessed me with a great journey.","It's been a terrific life.","Baseball is the president tossing out the first ball of the season. And a scrubby schoolboy playing catch with his dad on a Mississippi farm.","Baseball is a rookie, his experience no bigger than the lump in his throat as he begins fulfillment of his dream.","Nicknames are baseball, names like Zeke and Pie and Kiki and Home Run and Cracker and Dizzy and Dazzy.","I think God always has the best for us.","I have great faith that Heaven's there and I'll see my brothers and my mom and dad when I get there.","There's a man in Mobile who remembers that Honus Wagner hit a triple in Pittsburgh 46 years ago. That's baseball.","Baseball is a spirited race of man against man, reflex against reflex. A game of inches. Every skill is measured. Every heroic, every failing is seen and cheered, or booed. And then becomes a statistic.","Why the fairy tale of Willie Mays making a brilliant World Series catch, and then dashing off to play stickball in the street with his teenage pals. That's baseball. So is the husky voice of a doomed Lou Gehrig saying, 'I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of this earth.'","I knew that everybody could be replaced. Nobody lasts forever. And if you work for somebody, he's certainly got the privilege and the right to fire you.","I'm a failed newspaper man myself.","Everybody in the minor leagues - if you're a player, an announcer, whatever - wants to be in the big leagues.","I think if you checked the attendance records of all the announcers, you'd find a lot better record than you would of anybody else in any other business because we love the game and have a passion for it."],"Ernie Hudson":["What I get from my study of the Bible is that we're all in Christ, that we're all the same in God's eyes.","It's a hard call, but I've no desire to live my children's lives. I think my job as a father is to protect them, to allow them a safe place to grow up and to teach them what I've learned.","But when we have families, when we have children, this gives us a purpose for being, to protect our children, to avoid going to jail because if I'm in jail, who looks after my children, who's there for my wife?","When I finally decided that my only hope was to go to college, I took an acting class, and once I walked onstage, I just knew I was home.","Once I committed to acting, this has been it.","After all these years, almost 30 years later, whenever I'm on the street, someone will call out, 'Who you gonna call?'","The truths that are found in the Bible are universal truths. And it shapes who you are and guides you throughout your life.","What celebrities hope is that people identify not so much that they're particularly special or different, but they identify with them. We represent life in general, the guy who does whatever.","I find that the more I begin to look around, I see so much good that people do that goes unnoticed. So many wonderful things.","Every once in a while as an actor, you do something that the kids really like.","I think it's important to find the joy in your work and the things that sort of renew that.","You go down to Skid Row and you see literally hundreds of people and not just men, but women and children as well.

That same night, I also played drums for Martha and the Vandellas. Ah, the fond memories of being 14.","Playing guitar is not a beauty contest.","It's no surprise to me or the other Isley brothers that I can sing, because I used to sing all the time in practice.

So called because it's neither rare nor well done."],"Ernie Pyle":["Someday when peace has returned to this odd world I want to come to London again and stand on a certain balcony on a moonlit night and look down upon the peaceful silver curve of the Thames with its dark bridges.","If you go long enough without a bath, even the fleas will leave you alone.","I was away from the front lines for a while this spring, living with other troops, and considerable fighting took place while I was gone. When I got ready to return to my old friends at the front I wondered if I would sense any change in them.","About every two minutes a new wave of planes would be over. The motors seemed to grind rather than roar, and to have an angry pulsation like a bee buzzing in blind fury.","The closest fires were near enough for us to hear the crackling flames and the yells of firemen. Little fires grew into big ones even as we watched. Big ones died down under the firemen's valor only to break out again later.","I've been immersed in it too long. My spirit is wobbly and my mind is confused. The hurt has become too great.","If I can just see the European war out I think I might feel justified in quitting the war.","Swinging first and swinging to kill is all that matters now.","War makes strange giant creatures out of us little routine men who inhabit the earth.","All the rest of us - you and me and even the thousands of soldiers behind the lines in Africa - we want terribly yet only academically for the war to get over.","At last we are in it up to our necks, and everything is changed, even your outlook on life.","Below us the Thames grew lighter, and all around below were the shadows - the dark shadows of buildings and bridges that formed the base of this dreadful masterpiece.","But to the fighting soldier that phase of the war is behind. It was left behind after his first battle. His blood is up. He is fighting for his life, and killing now for him is as much a profession as writing is for me.","I've really been sick with this cold, but I think I might have kept the columns going anyhow except I was just so low in spirit, I didn't have the will to struggle against them when my deadline was so close and I felt so lousy.","In their eyes as they pass is not hatred, not excitement, not despair, not the tonic of their victory - there is just the simple expression of being here as though they had been here doing this forever, and nothing else.","It was a night when London was ringed and stabbed with fire.","Our artillery has really been sensational.

The dead now had that same unreality, which shocks without arousing pity.","And suddenly, like light in darkness, the real truth broke in upon me; the simple fact of Man, which I had forgotten, which had lain deep buried and out of sight; the idea of community, of unity.","The revolution is like a vessel filled with the pulsating heartbeat of millions of working people.","Slogans which deafened us so that we could not hear the truth.","We revolutionaries acknowledge the right to revolution when we see that the situation is no longer tolerable, that it has become a frozen. Then we have the right to overthrow it.","After that I could never pass a dead man without stopping to gaze on his face, stripped by death of that earthly patina which masks the living soul. And I would ask, who were you? Where was your home? Who is mourning for you now?","And the spirit of revolution will not die while the hearts of these workers continue to beat.","At that moment of realization I knew that I had been blind because I had wished not to see; it was only then that I realised, at last, that all these dead men, French and Germans, were brothers, and I was the brother of them all.","Each had defended his own country; the Germans Germany, the Frenchmen France; they had done their duty.","Gradually I became aware of details: a company of French soldiers was marching through the streets of the town. They broke formation, and went in single file along the communication trench leading to the front line. Another group followed them.","How happy I am to go to the front at last. To do my bit. To prove with my life what I think I feel.","I saw the dead without really seeing them.","Later we learned that it was one of our own men hanging on the wire. Nobody could do anything for him; two men had already tried to save him, only to be shot themselves.","Most people have no imagination. If they could imagine the sufferings of others, they would not make them suffer so. What separated a German mother from a French mother?","Soldiers and peasants lived together on friendly terms; they knew each other and their everyday routines, and trusted each other; they shook their heads together over the war.","The working class will not halt until socialism has been realized.","We thrust our fingers into our ears to stop its moan; but it was no good; the cry cut like a drill into our heads, dragging minutes into hours, hours into years. We withered and grew old between those cries."],"Ernst Zundel":["I am, as a European, absolutely shocked by European people. I am also shocked by European nationalist people. They have allowed themselves to be so emasculated so silently.","The reason why I have survived as long as I have survived is what my friends, comrades and supporters thought was an extraordinarily cautious approach.","I wore bulletproof vests, and my bodyguards had the option of having bulletproof vests - I bought five sets.","Had I been in Toronto, I would certainly have been killed in this attack. In the room where I normally sleep, the flames and the smoke and the soot is such that the gases would have killed me.","The unfortunate thing is, for the contents of the building I could not get any insurance anywhere in Canada.","Once you are a victim of a bombing, you enter a risk group to which they will not sell insurance.","And besides, I'm so in Dutch with my neighbors here that I thought that was better than getting them all upset with what might be a fake bomb scare where they'd have to clear out the whole neighborhood.","You know, many people have called me, friends from the nationalist camp, revisionists and so on, from around the world, have called me over the years - and now again because of what happened - and they are all very cynical about the police and the authorities.","They have accorded me my constitutional rights, and that is to their credit because the media hate campaign against me has been so intense and so vicious that it's a miracle that the police have taken such a professional approach.","The judge turned his back towards me, sitting back on his judge's chair, while I was in the witness stand being questioned. The whole courtroom was full of these anarchists, leftists, communists and Jewish lobbyists.","You cannot stoke the fires of prejudice against German people and then not find that somewhere, sometime down the road it doesn't discharge.","The trial of Ernst Zundel has gone down in Canadian history.","What we have to do now is to make the public at large aware that what we're looking at is not a historical event but - and I have to be brutal and I am going to say it - a racket.","For an event that was wholly created in the poisonous psychological warfare kitchens of the Second World War, run by the ministries of propaganda in many countries, not just by the British or the Americans, but also the Russians and undoubtedly the world Jewish organizations.","But as a German - and I am German-born - we Germans are condemned once again to be radical revisionists.","Conquerors never, never conquer a nation to bring freedom. They brought control.","I am not saying that during the Second World War Germany did not, under the leadership of the National Socialist government, commit crimes.","That generation of Germans, along with volunteers from Denmark, Holland, even England and the Free India division and so on, we Europeans were alert and awake to the danger of Bolshevism.","I am not saying that Hitler was a choir boy. But I am saying, let him who was innocent in the Second World War cast the first stone."],"Errol Flynn":["The public has always expected me to be a playboy, and a decent chap never lets his public down.","It isn't what they say about you, it's what they whisper.","My problem lies in reconciling my gross habits with my net income.","Any man who has $10,000 left when he dies is a failure.","My father was never anti-anything in our house.","Women won't let me stay single and I won't let me stay married.","I like my whisky old and my women young."],"Errol Morris":["The proper route to an understanding of the world is an examination of our errors about it.","I've never had any problem with crazy people. I like crazy people; I probably am a crazy person myself.","What's great about documentary, it seems to me, is that it can be experimental filmmaking. You have a license to do a lot of diverse things under the umbrella of 'documentary.'","I think an interview, properly considered, should be an investigation. You shouldn't know what the interview will yield. Otherwise, why do it at all?","But I can say what interests me about documentary is the fact that you don't know how the story ends at the onset - that you are investigating, with a camera, and the story emerges as you go along.","Photographs can reveal something to us, and they can also conceal things.","Listening to what people were saying wasn't even important. But it was important to look as if you were listening to what people were saying. Actually, listening to what people are saying, to me, interferes with looking as if you were listening to what people are saying.","People lie, and they always are very very creative in finding new ways to lie.","But there's a big difference between, say, reporting on a story and simply making up a story.","Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it without a sense of ironic futility.","Forty years ago this country went down a rabbit hole in Vietnam and millions died. I fear we're going down a rabbit hole once again - and if people can stop and think and reflect on some of the ideas and issues in this movie, perhaps I've done some damn good here!","I don't believe truth is conveyed by style and presentation. I don't think that if it was grainy and full of handheld material, it would be any more truthful.","Ecstatic absurdity: it's the confrontation with meaninglessness.","If everything was planned, it would be dreadful. If everything was unplanned, it would be equally dreadful.","Despite all of our efforts to control something, the world is much, much more powerful than us, and more deranged even than us.","If we're reading a first-person account, we know that each and every one of us, myself included, have a great desire to be seen in a certain way, or to be perceived in a certain way. It's unavoidable.","But one of the amazing things about documentary is that you can remake it every time you make one. There is no rule about how a documentary film has to be made.","When 'The Thin Blue Line' came out, I was criticized by many people for using reenactments, as if I wasn't dedicated to the truth because I filmed these scenes. That always and still seems to be nonsensical.","My advice to all interviewers is: Shut up and listen. It's harder than it sounds.","Certain kinds of intimacy emerge on a phone call that might never occur if you were sitting right next to the other person.","If you think you're going to create an unposed photograph, think again. There is no such thing.","First of all, tabloid stories are some of the richest and most important stories that we have. There's nothing wrong, per se, with tabloid stories.","If you're a journalist - and I think, on some level, I'm a journalist, and proud to be a journalist, or a documentarian, however you want to describe it - part of what I do has to be the pursuit of the truth.","A lot of stories that have fascinated me are tabloid stories that have come from other newspapers, like 'The New York Times.'","A lot of the themes of my movies, the actual stories, come from tabloid stories.","My stuff always starts with interviews. I start interviewing people, and then slowly but surely, a movie insinuates itself.","I used to work as a private detective years and years ago.","There are endless anxieties in putting a film together, and it's an enormous relief when you know it's working with an audience.","I like to think that I'm nonjudgmental, that I can listen and be engaged by almost anything.","I believe it was probably less than ten minutes that went by from the invention of photography to the point where people realized that they could lie with photographs.","I've been writing a lot more, I believe, because of the Internet. I've been posting stuff that I've written and I've just been writing.","A movie is like a tip of an iceberg, in a way, because so little of what you do in connection with making a movie actually gets into the movie. Almost everything gets left behind.","You know, I actually like doing commercials. I don't like doing them to the exclusion of everything else, but I like doing them.","Films are neither true nor false. That includes my films, as well as others. They may make claims that are true or false, but films are too complex. They have too many ingredients.","I taught my son to read with tabloids. We would sit to read the 'Weekly World News' together.","Do I like tawdry, sleazy stories? Yeah, I do.","We all know that yellow journalism didn't just happen a week ago or a month ago, that yellow journalism has probably been with us as long as journalism has been with us.","You're meant to think somehow that literature, in espousing eternal values, is kind of normal and balanced and reasonable. When it fact it's anything but.","I've never made any money off of any of my films. Statement of fact. So without commercial work, I would be in big trouble.","Interviews, when they are just simply an exercise in hearing what you want to hear, are of no interest.","I feel as if I became a documentary film-maker only because I had writer's block for four decades.

I have a real duty to earn the trust of the faculty. I don't just deserve it. I have to earn it.","I think that if we don't get these politicians to come together we face the most predictable economic crisis in history.","I think it's absolutely clear that the fiscal path we are on is not sustainable, and for me, the best analogy is these deficits are like a cancer, and over time they will destroy the country from within.","Romney said that his tax reform proposal is 'very similar to the Simpson-Bowles plan.'

And most of them are small holder subsistence farmers.","Too often, as a global community of humanitarians, we meet the needs of the same families, the same individuals, the same communities crisis after crisis, when we are focused on meeting crisis needs but not on building resilience.","Our goals and what we hope to achieve by moving to food assistance is even in supporting the crisis needs of the most vulnerable people, we provide them with the capacity to be more resilient to the next shock.","The people in the United States are some of the most generous people in the world. We saw it in Haiti. We saw it with Katrina. When devastation strikes, American people want to step up.","One of my strengths is my ability to talk and communicate with people.","When people are hungry, when a mother or father is facing a child that they can't feed, you can't ask that family to lay down their arms.","The majority of small-holder farmers in Africa are women and, in urban areas, you're primarily looking at women-led households. So we can't solve hunger if we don't have gender-sensitive programming that addresses access to opportunities for women, whether it's through education or tools for cooking, like solar-powered stoves.","Don't ever take a seven-year-old with you to a campaign dinner - they will embarrass you no end.","I'm lucky.

You can be a person of faith and really enjoy life and laugh.'","God has given us an imagination, and our imagination is really the principle tool from which all creativity and artistry comes from.","One trend I see is the rejection of growth for self-discovery and the pursuit of authentic community. So we keep whittling our spiritual community to a smaller and smaller and more exclusive inner circle. The problem is if the diagnoses are wrong, so will be the cure.","It is the creative and enterprising spirit of people that is indispensable. Everything else is supplemental.","I think we've overstated that God is the God who wants us to obey. Obedience is not the end game. Obedience is only our calling so that we can step into our freedom.","How many people just get up on Monday and do the same thing they've done every single Monday - go to work and just turn on route automatic and no longer have any meaning in their life?","The reality is that every human being is placed on this planet, and one of the things that drives humans is their need for meaning, and if you can make every job meaningful, then you will guarantee that every job will be done to its highest level of excellence.","The Bible is not an antiquated text. The scriptures are the text that will lead us into the future.","There is something powerful about singing to God as an act of worship, but it is time to reframe our perspective and our language to genuinely encompass all of life as worship.","I think Christianity is the same as Buddhism and Hinduism - whenever a religion begins to say that these are the things you have to do to be loved by God, you have a religion.","I love what Monet, Picasso, Van Gogh and Jesus all said - that love is really the driving principle of the creative act. In fact, they would say that great art is always inspired by love.","I have an incredible confidence in the resilience of the human spirit and the creative ability of the Holy Spirit. So, if you can get people asking the right questions, it really will start moving in the right direction.","While we would love to have no criticism, probably if we had no critique, we wouldn't be doing anything meaningful.","If you look at it from just a pure economic basis, technology is replacing all of the jobs robots can do, and machinery is replacing the jobs that humans once held. If we don't train our children to imagine, to create, they're going to be unemployable.","God has leveraged the human spirit to move in His direction, and all the material we need to bring a person to the realization that they were created by God actually already exists inside that person.","I know it sounds crazy, but as soon as Christians start telling non-Christians how to live their lives, we've lost the Christian faith.","Our job is not to change people; our job is to connect people to Jesus, and it's Jesus' job to change people.","I think the opportunity to bring together the people in the world of politics, business and entertainment and have an opportunity to listen to their best learning and thinking is a great opportunity.","We're a part of the insurrection, trying to turn Christianity upside down. We're an experimental church: God's research and development arm.","I hope my greatest contribution will be to try to extract principles of truth that will cause us to live our lives in a more effective way and to advance Jesus' purpose in the world.","You can plant a church and grow a church. That's not that hard to do, but it's harder to be a viable source of transformation in a city or your time or space.","I have so much confidence in the reality of Jesus that I feel no pressure to try to make people act or be a certain way. I'm banking everything on the fact that God actually changes people.","Religion as a whole specializes in sin management. It's all about organizing humanity in such a way that we cause as little damage as possible.","When we look at history, we see history is made up of the heroes of their times. Yet, somehow we miss this when we put on the lens of the Scriptures.","Wherever and whenever God is moving in a new and fresh way, there emerges a new song!","Los Angeles has been known as the center of creativity but has often been equally known for the absence of spirituality.","From the beginning, our community has been focused on people outside of Christianity. But that emphasis means that a lot of hard work is represented in every person who is baptized.","I've worked in the business world and, as a futurist, the whole 20 years that I've led at Mosaic.","The system of Christian celebrity was not a good space for me, and it was brutal on my kids - my son in college was frequently confronted by people railing against me as a heretic.","If you come at the Bible as if it's a document of encyclopedic information, you've pretty much killed any kind of life change in a seeker and unbeliever.","The Bible has been trapped in modernity. Everything has to work perfectly. And if everything doesn't fit in a Lego-oriented functionality, then we don't deal with it as Christians.","I think we are all trying to figure out what it means to be the Church as opposed to just doing church.","If we keep asking the wrong questions, we are just going to get better wrong answers. The solution to lack of community isn't to give up on the community.","I think the exploration and the search for who Jesus is, and that 2,000 years later we're still trying to figure out who He was, and did He really rise from the dead... And I think for me, the answer is 'yes,' and that's why we're talking about Him today.","When researchers try to break down what is happening at Mosaic, far too often they see the skin and miss the heart.","We are constantly learning and growing and changing. We are really an experiment. We are endeavoring to discover if a community of faith can exist purely for the good of others.","I think that's a part of what motivates me in my teaching and writing. Once the Gospel feels mainstream and becomes a nicely organized, orchestrated belief system, frankly, I don't think there is even an attraction to the human spirit.","I became a Christian because I met God.","The word 'entertain' means to hold someone's attention, and what we want is a faith that is vibrant and alive and beautiful and real.","You have a generation that is saying we are tapping out of religion in many ways. But what they are not saying is that we are tapping out of a serious search for meaning in life.","The bulk of our community is probably between the ages of 20 and 34.","My primary assessment would be because American Christians tend to be incredibly self-indulgent, so they see the church as a place there for them to meet their needs and to express faith in a way that is meaningful for them.","I think many times Christians don't really take the opportunity to hear what people are saying and seeing in the world around them.","I had someone a month ago tell me at a campaign lunch that you can't be a Christian and a Democrat. I think that that view is dissipating very, very fast.","We focus, in some ways, on how to disengage Jesus and the Bible from everything people know about Christianity as a religion.","People outside of the faith really appreciate Mosaic and really love what we're doing.","Often we talk about God's ability to change lives without fully understanding how to access that power.","For Christians, they need to access the power of Jesus and not look at Christianity as a religion. It is our Lord Jesus that makes you change, and Christians need to actualize it and put it into practice.","We need to understand that Christianity is about changing; it is not about a religion.","Promise Keepers was looking for a movement that can actualize the hope of Jesus, the hope that we see. And 'Uprising' was what they were looking for.","One of the things you'll discover... as you listen to your own soul is that you spend a great amount of your life trying to bring meaning to your own life. And, by the way, most people are not going to church, so the place they're actually trying to find meaning in their life is at work.","We want to help everyone find meaning in their life and help translate the story that each person actually matters in the world."],"Erwin Neher":["Of course I have other interests, but on the other hand, science is a lifestyle in the sense that it's a combination of profession and hobby.","You do what you like because you just follow your curiosity, and you are happy when you find new things about nature, about how things work around us and inside us.","Do you trust in your fellow citizens, in a sense that whatever they will have in additional tools they will use in balance more to the good or more to the bad?

The barrier between them cannot be said to have broken down as a result of recent experience in the physical sciences, for this barrier does not exist.","A careful analysis of the process of observation in atomic physics has shown that the subatomic particles have no meaning as isolated entities, but can only be understood as interconnections between the preparation of an experiment and the subsequent measurement.","An animal that embarks on forming states without greatly restricting egoism will perish.","I don't like it, and I'm sorry I ever had anything to do with it.","The verbal interpretation, on the other hand, i.e. the metaphysics of quantum physics, is on far less solid ground.

Eat as healthy as I can.","I believed in myself, and I've always worked very, very hard as an artist, and I am an artist in every sense of the word.","I'm a woman who has gone through many heartaches, enough to dedicate my whole life to trying to figure them out.","I thought the Billie Holiday comparison was beautiful. I think, Wow, what a wonderful, creative, helpful spirit. She's someone who wanted to help others by sharing her emotion. That's what I do, too, so I think that's a great comparison.","I have a master plan as an artist. I've always said I'm not going to be punching nobody's clock. I will work as an artist to survive in this world.","I'm a performance artist first; I'm a recording artist second.","Marvin Gaye is one of my favorite revolutionaries. He spoke from his heart, his mind. That's what I want to do.","What does music mean to me? I don't think I would really be much without it, without it coming through me. It's my means of communication, my means of growth, my means of transportation from one point in my life to another.","The kind of music or the kind of arrangements that I do, the kind of musicians I choose, is just what I like to hear.","Oh, yeah, I see the world differently now. Actually, when I first had the baby, I was breast-feeding him for two years straight. So we were together for two years of his life, every single day, all hours of the day. So I was two people, and I eventually morphed back into one.","I consider my musical ability to be a gift from the Creator. It's not that I try to work hard or nothing like that, it's a gift, it was given to me, and I appreciate it.","I grew up listening to old soul.","When you're in a relationship you want it to work. My parents did, I did. But we are not taught how to make it work.","Being honest is my job. That's what music is for me.","I'm not trying to win an award for being the best vegetarian, just want to be healthy. Take a salt bath. Do things that my parents were never able to do. I'm blessed to do anything I want, so I decide to take the best care of my body and my family in the same way. Holistically. Vitally.","There are millions and billions of atoms of memory of all kinds of musical themes in me.","Music and the music business are two different things.","I don't sing melodically. Rhyme pattern is how I sing. I also write like a lyricist or an MC because that's what I was before I was a singer. I just took those elements and put them into music.","What makes me furious, not just because we're in an interview, but I don't like when writers take your words and put them somewhere else, in the wrong context in their own article about you.","I'm not satisfied with the explanations I get from tv or from school.","I love putting the music together. It's like art.","I don't read music or anything, so when I produce, I go basically by ear.","Anything that had to do with art I been doing all my life. It was a gift. It's nothing I work real hard at doing.","But now I realize that this record business really needs me. No one else is trying to take a chance or do something different.","From then on, I realized this is what I want to do, what I'm supposed to do: Giving energy and receiving it back through applause. I love it. That's my world. I love it. I enjoy it. I live for it.","I knew it would happen. I knew I'd be No. 1. I'm a new artist; I don't know the rules. Nobody told me it wouldn't happen.","I started performing at two or three on a tape recorder, one of those little flat recorders where you just push play and record.","I'll dabble here and there in different forms of the art, but the label has me locked down like a slave so, of course, I'll be doing albums during this time.","Man, I don't want to have nothing to do with computers. I don't want the government in my business.","No one chooses to raise children alone.","I've had two children. I've had three boyfriends. I've had a lot of things happen that can change your opinions and values and philosophies.","I can be Erykah the human being more than the celebrity.","I love being an entertainer - not really fond of being a celebrity.","I don't have one song that sounds like another one in my entire catalog.","I'm kind of a recluse when it comes to going outside.","I try to be honest and I keep moving.","I've been a vegetarian since I was 19.","Hip-hop is the people. What the people are moving toward is what hip-hop is. I think people are moving toward a freer way of thinking. Openness.","Hip-hop was created out of necessity. We needed to create some digitized things to help us understand what we were feeling."],"Esa-Pekka Salonen":["Once you get over the first hill, there is always a new, higher one lurking, of course.","I'm still disturbed if a chord isn't together, but your priorities change as you get older.","Orchestras have become used to the emphasis on the separation of layers, of the ultimate precision and clarity.","I always had, deep down, a slight aversion toward the purely cerebral in music.","I discovered that the people of the North are different and there's no way you can make a person from the North similar to a Southerner. They're two different worlds.","The underlying process in Northern music tends to be slower and continuous, whatever's happening on the surface; in Southern music the underlying process is always faster.","The Northern idea of form is more of a process. The various units of the form overlap. You can't tell where some things stop and new things start. This is typical of Sibelius.","This conducting thing happened. In 1983 I was sucked into this international career, which was a very scary experience.","The music I turn out these days is the kind of music I want to hear myself.","I can't imagine how many first performances I've done, perhaps 500. Some of them have been very good, and some of course very bad.","Pulse as an active means of expression, Stravinsky and Beethoven are the two masters of that.","Stravinsky is masterly: his harmony is conceived so precisely that it can only be the way it is.","I've learned a lot from the masters of orchestration, like Ravel and Stravinsky.","My music wouldn't sound the way it does if I hadn't had the experience of conducting.","I feel very free and very happy to be a composer.","There is such a suspicion in today's world of people who do more than one thing, who aren't specialized.","Anyone who composes and conducts at the same time is immediately suspect, because he must be faking one or the other.","The act of conducting in itself, of waving my arms in the air and being in charge, I didn't miss. I missed the sensual pleasure of being in contact with music.","With American orchestras, in particular, because they play in such huge halls, getting a true pianissimo is very hard.","The players never think they project enough. In a hall that seats 3,300 people, it's a very scary thing to play so quietly that you can barely hear yourself.","This continuity of sound and form was something that I became really interested in from working with Ligeti. He was always going on about how form has to be continuous.","If the seams are showing, there is something wrong with the performance or the construction of the piece. This idea is completely at odds with our modern visual experience, because everything today is based on montage.","As we watch TV or films, there are no organic transitions, only edits. The idea of A becoming B, rather than A jumping to B, has become foreign.","After working with Ligeti I began to hear Brahms and Beethoven differently.","In the range of music that we play - roughly 300 years' worth-there really are more similarities than differences.","Los Angeles is just a more open place. The way L.A. functions is that people give you a forum. They say, Show us what you can do.","In Europe, there is so much tradition, and everyone has established ideas as to what art should be and what it has always been.","There is more openness in LA to possibilities than on the East Coast of America. There is a pioneering spirit there that stems from the reason people went out there in the first place-to find something new.","I don't believe in an annual dose of film music for the sake of it being film music. If we program film music, it will be because there is a real artistic reason for doing so.","This country, and the West Coast, especially, is bad at preserving any cultural legacy.","I love a visceral sound, the kind that hits you in the belly.","Music has just as much to do with movement and body as it does soul and intellect.","When we're at the end of The Rite of Spring or of a Bruckner symphony, I want people to feel the music physically.","The Royal Festival Hall in London is nice; people hang out there. I think this inviting, non-exclusive character is very important.","The sound was my greatest concern. There were certain difficulties getting used to the way every musician can hear his or herself, the way each of them relates to the musician in the next seat.","Every day we make more progress toward understanding the concert hall.","There will have to be times when I'm not conducting because I'm composing. I haven't solved that problem, and perhaps I never will."],"Esai Morales":["Being an American is a state of mind, and to be in a family is to feel the power of belonging, the power of your roots. Family is a tree, the strength of a tree, the roots, the leaves, the past and the present, the future, the fruits, the seeds.","I love bringing roses to a woman when she least expects it.","I love being irreverent. But I hate being irrelevant. I love being irreverent because at the end of the day your actions belie your intentions.","We hear a lot in this country about family, and 'American Family' just shows us a portrait we haven't seen as much of yet. 'American Family' lets us know that being American isn't about the color of your hair or eyes or skin: it's really a state of mind.","I'll never lose the sense of being an underdog.","I think that racism has gotten more subtle, and it's not even racism anymore: it's placism. Like where you live or whether you went to community college or Harvard, and it exists within the race.","We as Americans of Latin descent are just as American as anyone else of any other descent.","Anytime you do something Latino, yeah, I love the color, the spice.","My character Esteban is a guy who really didn't think he was gonna be there at this point in his life. He's in his early 30s. He's got a son. He's raising his son as a single father.","I'm really, really dumb about describing wine, but I like wine that's full-bodied and dry.","I like the Beatles. They're at the core of my musicality. And John Lennon's my spiritual father.","I just arrive, they hand me a script and say, do it.","In order to be a lieutenant, you've got to have authority in your voice. No matter how young your face looks, you've got to let your guys know that you're in charge.","I'm a very romantic person.","I love shocking people.","I went jogging up on Mulholland. In the middle of my run I had some form of asthma attack and couldn't even walk. I couldn't get a ride one block to my house. I thought I was going to die.","I always pull over for people who need a push.","If you don't look like the ruling class, bring your inhaler.","I don't get paid like a person that everyone knows, but I get paid so much more in so many ways.","You know, I'm not making top dollar, but when you're making top dollar, there are a lot of people waiting for you to fall.","Being an actor you have a lot of expenses.","Well, actually yes, in 1988. There was a warrant for me because my assistant hadn't paid a ticket of mine.","I am tired of our characters being so incomplete. When do we ever save the day in a film? When does a Latino actor get to be the hero?","I believe if people understood each other more, if people took the time and realize it's not 'all about me' and I'm on a big planet with a lot of other people and concerns, maybe we can learn how to get along with each other.","I remember doing 'La Bamba' and thinking, 'Do you really think that Latinos will be accepted in mainstream?' and I said, 'Someday I hope so, but there is no guarantee.'","Shows like 'Seinfeld' and 'Friends,' they have, like, one or two damn characters throughout the whole series that are minorities.","I think the legacy left behind by 'Battlestar' speaks for itself. I thought that these avid fans, most of whom were skeptical at first... to turn them into a fan of 'Caprica' as well is a daunting task, a big challenge.","All I would say to people who doubt 'Caprica' is: Everything good starts slow.","I don't want to be the 'spice' added to a show. I'm not a condiment!","It's people politics, people dynamics that make a show really good, whether it's 'Desperate Housewives' or 'Lost' or 'The Sopranos.' It's the people we've grown to love or otherwise.","Frankie is my baby. He is the sweetest dog in the world. Frankie is like the son I never had. He keeps me healthy; I walk and run him. I always feel that I need to spend more time with him and give him more attention. I find myself unloading my emotions on him.","In New York, just standing still on the sidewalk is a weird feeling. You have this incessant need to do things. Los Angeles is about kicking back, relaxing, your inner child, peace.","My mother taught me when you go someplace, you leave it better than you found it.","I see myself being a father, hopefully a husband, but I'm very gun-shy. The older I get, the further the goalpost.","Do I have to see movies and television about the English throne or the Holocaust every year? There are multiple multi-million dollar movies with the same backdrop. But our Holocaust - meaning Latino - aren't ever told.","We understand 'Roots,' and that experience was mind-boggling, and it changed the way society viewed race relations. It was incredibly important. With 'Roots,' I was just as proud as anybody else that people of color were getting their stories told.","When you have a little 10-month-old who is climbing up your leg because you are their mountain - there's no nobler reason to get out of bed every day. There's no better reason to live, to make sure you provide as much guidance and as much room for that child to thrive.","How often do you get a movie where the coolest character has your own real last name? I played Bob Morales as a cross between my own father - the passion, the fury - and the real Bob Morales. I loved that movie. People, kids always come up to me and tell me how much they still love 'La Bamba.'"],"Esha Gupta":["You need a strong family because at the end, they will love you and support you unconditionally. Luckily, I have my dad, mom and sister.","I would never like to endorse a fairness cream. I believe in natural beauty.","My day starts at 5 A.M. and gets over at 10:30 P.M. Its a long day but I love it... I can't sit idle.","Delhi is definitely a foodie's paradise.","I never get bored of a workout, because I feel great after a session.","I'm very low-maintenance, and that is a problem. I'm not demanding at all, and sometimes I feel that I should be throwing tantrums. But since I don't party or socialise, and am very low-key, I think that makes me very low-maintenance. Actually, I'm the most boring person at a party.","I am a die-hard romantic at heart and love the idea of love. But, when it comes to love, I kinda believe in the old world charm of romance - where there's mystery and intrigue.","I speak Hindi fluently because my mother speaks only in Hindi and Urdu.","I am not saying that I won't do big commercial films.","I like my man to be witty; he needs a sense of humour and needs to be extremely well-mannered.","Of all the options I had got, I think whatever films I have chosen to do are best.","I still don't know what genre I fit into. I want to try my hand at different things and find out what I am best at. I want to discover myself as an actress.","My parents are extremely proud of me.","Being a vegetarian really saves lives.","If you love animals, please don't eat them.","I love watching horror films because I don't get scared easily.","I clean my own utensils, my house and I even travel alone. I don't know what the life of a superstar is like.","I don't think women in India are vulnerable.","If a woman goes out with different men on different days, women only will question her character and call her all sort of names.","Women will always be beautiful no matter what, and that's their specialty!","It wasn't easy for me to start in Bollywood because I was an outsider.","I believe in myself, and that's why I take criticism. You need to be very strong to survive in Bollywood. If someone calls me a bad actress, I won't live with it but will work towards improving myself.","Initially, my father opposed the idea of joining films and did not want me to move out, but now I'm closest to him and have his full support.","I'd rather be appreciated for my character in a film than my looks.","I come from an army background, and everyone at my home has a habit of getting up early. I continue this habit even today.","Whenever I get three-four days in hand, I fly down to Delhi to spend time with my family and my dog.","While I was growing up, all the boys used to be my buddies. I never got that special kind of attention from them, and I was the tomboy around. Although I've become an actress today, I still have those traits.","I have been battling vertigo for a long time. It's something that I deal with on a daily basis.","Women look really sexy doing action on-screen, and it is my favorite genre.","Martial arts should be part of every girl's education.","You cannot just scream and yell unless you feel it in your whole body.","The moment I wake up, I have to eat. If I don't eat, I feel like my blood pressure is dropping. I get crabby if I have gone more than half an hour without eating.","I have never had a dietician and I never will, unless I get a disease.","I enjoy cooking for people I am close to.","I don't really flaunt any gadget, but I am loving my Nokia Lumia.","I would love to take a road trip across Italy in an Aston Martin S Coupe.","I never even wanted to be an actress. I studied mass communication and wanted to study law in Newcastle, for which I even got a scholarship. But by then, I had started modelling. So, I took a year off to decide what to do. But once you are used to working, it's difficult to get back to studies.","I don't think anyone has made me except myself. I think I have done it on my own.","I just hate going to the gym, unless I need to do cardio once in a while. I think gymming makes you stiff and takes your aura away.","I'm a total water-baby. I've seen some pristine beaches, from Greece to Goa.","When you walk on the road and people scream out your name, the high is unparalleled.","I have a very broad-minded family. Acting is an art, and we understand that."],"Eskinder Nega":["I sleep in peace, even if only in the company of lice, behind bars. The same could not be said of my incarcerators though they sleep in warm beds, next to their wives, in their homes.","Aggregate aid is to the Ethiopian economy what Obama's fiscal stimulus was to the American economy: minus these injections, both economies would suffer catastrophically. The theatrical blustering of the Ethiopian government notwithstanding, donor countries have a make-or-break power over the Ethiopia's prosperity.","I am jailed, with around 200 other inmates, in a wide hall that looks like a warehouse.","I've never conspired to overthrow the government; all I did was report on the Arab Spring and suggest that something similar might happen in Ethiopia if the authoritarian regime didn't reform.","Under the previous regime of Prime Minister Meles Zenawi, I was detained. So was my wife, Serkalem Fasil. She gave birth to our son in prison in 2005.","Tyranny is increasingly unsustainable in this post-cold-war era. It is doomed to failure. But it must be prodded to exit the stage with a whimper - not the bang that extremists long for.","I was arrested in September 2011 and detained for nine months before I was found guilty in June 2012 under Ethiopia's overly broad Anti-Terrorism Proclamation, which ostensibly covers the 'planning, preparation, conspiracy, incitement and attempt' of terrorist acts.","In the long march of history, at least two poles of attraction and antagonism have been the norm in world politics. Rarely has only one nation carried the burden of leadership. The unipolar world of the 21st century, dominated for the past two decades by the United States, is a historical anomaly.","I distinctly remember the vivacious optimism that inundated the United States when the Soviet Union imploded in the early 1990s. This was not glee generated by the doom of an implacable enemy, but thrill germinated by the real possibilities that the future held for freedom.","As Ethiopia goes, so goes the whole Horn of Africa - a region where instability can have major security and humanitarian implications for the United States and Europe.","Democracy is a destiny of humanity which cannot be averted. It can be delayed but not defeated.","All the great crimes of history, lest we forget, have their genesis in the moral wilderness of their times.","Wont to unlearn from history, we aptly repeat even its most brazen mistakes.","As a prisoner of conscience committed to peaceful transition to democracy, I urge Europe to apply economic sanctions against Ethiopia. What short-term pain may result will be compensated by long-term gain. A pledge to re-engage energetically with a democratic Ethiopia would act as a catalyst for reform.","We live in an age of global expectations. Our hopes have converged in many ways, none more so than in our democratic aspirations."],"Esme Bianco":["You can't get anywhere in life without taking risks.","Objectivity is almost a choice you make. As a burlesque performer, I didn't choose to be objectified.","I don't think the very fact that I'm a woman makes me suddenly more vulnerable or more inherently used and abused.","We see a lot of gory deaths on 'Game of Thrones.'"],"Esperanza Spalding":["On nights that I'm feeling a need to stretch personally and artistically, I tend to put together outfits that are very quirky, mismatched and over-the-top eclectic.","I just want to say, if you're going crazy, take a break. I felt overwhelmed by stuff that wasn't satisfying me, things I was supposed to do for my career. I stopped and said, 'Let me get back to the basics.'","As you go back or move toward insights/ideas/events/words/lessons/mistakes in the past, you develop into the future from the present. I think that's pretty cool that two quote-unquote opposites are intrinsically linked. That whole theme of opposites being two sides of the same whole is a theme that's always been intriguing to me.","I think there's so much negative influence on children in school settings. It becomes learning by rote to pass a test. It's not contextualized.","There's enough time in the day: If you go to bed at 10 and start your day at 6, there's a lot you can do in a day!","I don't think it's about playing and singing, to be honest. That seems like old news, you know? I wasn't thinking about that. I just think that's in my body now. Dancers don't think about their legs moving one way and their arms moving another. Over time, you incorporate that into your instrument.","Jazz has always been a melting pot of influences and I plan to incorporate them all.","I grew up with an incredibly loving and supportive family that gave me the impression there were a lot of options for me out there.","I just think music is so intrinsically linked with images in the culture that we live in that you'll be hard-pressed to have an experience with the music without a preconceived notion.","If you don't already know about jazz music, how would you be exposed? How would get an opportunity to find out if it spoke to you? If you get exposed to it enough, you might find a taste for it.","There's nothing wrong with struggle. Anytime I look back at a difficult phase of my life and see what grew out of it - the creative survival tactics - I think that the good is way better than the bad.","There's a guy I used to pay to work with me who'd call me 'kiddo.' I said, 'There's nothing that justifies you expressing that to me, your boss.'","It's about process, the process of growth. It seems to me in my own life - and other minds throughout history have also observed this phenomenon - that growth seems to move in two directions at the same time.","I don't watch TV, I don't spend time on the Internet, and I don't party much. I don't text very much, either.","You can grow up with literally nothing and you don't suffer if you know you're loved and valued.","My earliest attempts at writing were when I was seven. I would sit at the piano and transcribe the songs I heard on the radio. I'd change little things in the music and write different lyrics.","Genre boundaries are good for marketing but they all but disappear when you're a player.","Anything I do has to have integrity, so if you just want to make music, it's not difficult finding support. The hard part for a publicist or manager is making a star.","There is an assumption that if you're young and pretty, you will get all these opportunities that are way beyond your musical foundation.","I always say that the problem with jazz accessibility is not the content of the music, it's people's ability to access it.","It's a pity that if someone who has a really profoundly potent art to share chooses not to or doesn't fit into this very thin slice of what's desirable and marketable, chances are the public will never get a chance to hear what they're doing.","I like to read, and I like dance. I don't dance, but I like to see other people dance.","I love people, and I love to be with people and to make music with people, but my natural state is to revert back to being by myself in my house, which is cool because that's where I practice and write and listen and study.","The benefit of the radio is, something beyond your realm of knowledge can surprise you, can enter your realm of knowledge.","I never think my music isn't easy until I got to teach it to other people.","I write at the piano, so I write things that fit comfortably under my hands, and I'm not thinking in terms of any specific compositional methods. I'm just seeking sounds.","For what I can imagine and feel and think and hear, I can hardly do anything on the acoustic bass. It used to be just pure frustration of imagining so much more and being able to get to a certain level of execution.","I am insubordinate by nature. I can't help it.","I love Aretha Franklin, Edith Piaf, Blondie.","If you're a writer, and you write fiction, that's not all you read.","You don't have to be fearless to do anything; you can be scared out of your mind. I fear that I won't get better and that I won't have time to practice. To be called a 'jazz musician' - it's a big responsibility.","And I feel that it's inevitable that the work that I do will reflect the life that I live. And the life I live feels very diverse.","Your sanity is harder to get back than money or contacts. You are the magic. You are the art. You can't lose that.","When something in art or music piques my interest, I tend to go check it out, and most things I check out, I'm not very good at. But a few things I've gone to check out have given me back as much love as I gave them, usually much more.","When I was a kid, people called me Emily rather than Esperanza, even though my full name is Esperanza Emily Spalding.","I focused primarily on being an instrumentalist and studying music and on my primary means of expression: composing and playing.","When I was a kid, I was really curious about acting. And I was interested in movement and dance. I wasn't good at either of those things - I didn't work at those things.","I'm realizing now that I was always really curious about inviting people into a space and sharing information that way. But I didn't have any context for it. It was just fun because I was homeschooled and lonely and bored, and I'd do things to get people to come over.","I was exposed to many kinds of music including rock and disco, classical and folk, Midtown and Miles Davis, Sly Stone and David Bowie.","I put my mother through a lot when I was a teenager. I used to lie a lot. Now, we talk all the time."],"Essence Atkins":["After 35, I felt like I'd been in these relationships; some were great, some weren't so great, but they weren't right partnerships.","What online dating did was offer me the opportunity to go out with a bunch of different people from different industries; I really didn't want to limit myself with people who are in the entertainment industry.","I attended Professional Children's School in Manhattan because my ballet and modern dance schedules were intensive and had started to interfere with regular school hours.","Challenges, when you're in a tumultuous situation, are an opportunity to grow, an opportunity to get closer to God, an opportunity to find and kind of reform yourself, and to figure out what really matters and what your priorities are.","I like to make Arroz con Gandules, rice with pigeon peas. My husband loves it. It's a Puerto Rican dish my mother taught me.","Reality TV is really just based for sensationalism. So, it's extreme versions and extreme caricatures of personalities."],"Essie Davis":["Everyone has a point of view about corporal punishment.","It's hard, but what's the point of having children unless you're there to raise them, I reckon.","'The Slap' is not like anything else. It's an incredibly well-written novel that has been turned into a great and intriguing series that reveals both less and more about each character than you learn in the book. It's a novel that has been given a second chance to live.","Even though I love fashion and the red carpet dresses are a great, fun, glorious thing, I don't really have my finger on the pulse, as Phryne Fisher does, of the fashion industry.","I feel lucky that I've managed to get the roles I've wanted.","Trying to get over to the 'on camera' side of things has been hard work.","Getting fan mail from Brazil is kind of funny.","I'm a fan of mindfulness, and if colouring in is a way of reaching mindfulness, then I think it's great. But I'm amazed that anyone has the time to do that. I certainly don't.","I have children, and they demand my full and complete attention. They get that when I'm at home, even during the night, but it is really hard, and I do wonder how a lot of women do it without bawling their eyes out every day.","Acting is embarrassing.","I never spend more than a week away from the children.","I was terrified of being a mum because I didn't think I'd ever be grown up enough.","I think every character rubs off on you a little bit.","I've had really a great choice of roles that have been very different from one another. And I think I kind of set out to do that when I began my career - to aim to never play the same thing twice.","I honestly do think that every character - you pick up the things, little things that you like about them in your life. Especially if you play a character for a long time.","Sometimes it's easy to do brave things in front of a thousand people, but it's hard to do them in front of a handful. It feels so much more exposing.","One of the things I have loved so much about the career that I have had is that pretty much every character I have played is diametrically opposite to the one before it.","I used to buy things for every hotel room or every place I lived in to make it feel like home.","I would love to get a job in France!","I miss my friends in London, and I really miss New York. But I also miss the stability of staying in one place and being able to just open a drawer if you've run out of sticky tape and chuck a new roll in the holder.","I never said I wanted to be a movie star.","I want to have the great roles that move people profoundly. I want to have the choice and be given the opportunity to play those roles, and unfortunately, fame plays a huge part in that.","I'm incredibly ambitious, but I feel I've got a fantastic career, and I love the anonymity. I love that no one knows who I am.","I don't know if I want to walk down the street and have everyone staring. I think that would be awful. I'm a pretty shy person, really.","Most mothers think they are bad mothers. We all make terrible mistakes, often, and always think we're getting it wrong.","Parenting is meant to be just a natural part of life. You just think you know how to do it but, of course, it's much more complicated than that.","I personally don't resent having my children.","Phryne Fisher could walk down the red carpet; Essie Davis is something else.","As soon as you become a parent, everyone gives you their parenting advice. It's like an onslaught of information about how other people do it.","I love Australia and loved growing up here, and that's something I don't want to deny our children, but it's difficult sustaining a career in Australia.","Being a mother impacts every aspect of your life. It's a rite of passage which gives you an entirely different outlook on things.","The news is so instantly available to us without delay, interpretation, or a filter. What is hot right now is streamed live without context or perspective.","I grew up with a love of words.","It's such a magnificent thing to be able to love someone and expect nothing from them.","I wanted to be an actor, but only because I wanted to be everything, and that was the only way I could be a marine biologist as well.","I always knew I wanted to go to NIDA. I think I was very fortunate, and I do doubt myself often, but I didn't see any possibility of me not going to NIDA. I believed in myself, and I believed that, if you really do want something, you get it.","'The Custodian' was my first film, and there were so many lessons to learn in that week. It was really fun, but for me, I look at it as a training film, and I'm not really proud of my work in it.","I do like having a private life.","I think my morals are perfectly... tight!","Goals are essentially private things.","People who don't know how old I am can cast me as the woman in 'Girl with a Pearl Earring' and can cast me as Stella in 'Streetcar Named Desire,' and they are miles apart.","I want to carry a really great role in a great film.","I have learnt a lot about theatre, and I would like to know the same about film.","Awards and nominations really help sell films.","There's something great about being on location with a bunch of people - there's a camaraderie and intimacy that builds up over time.","There are some jobs that you go for because achieving them would take your career in a direction that you would like it to go, but mostly, I want to play the roles and have had the great good fortune and opportunities to play some fantastic roles and been very, very fortunate.","It's nice being married to somebody who thinks you've got something better in you.","I've sung before, first in a band in high school and then in a band in Norway, but never in a musical.","I learn the techniques and then take what I need. I have the Essie Davis technique of acting. I'm an instinctive actress.","I think the unemployment rate for actors is pretty much the same in Sydney, London and New York. In all three cities, there are more actors than there are jobs. But I do think that there are far more acting opportunities in London and New York than in Sydney, where there are approximately seven actors that you see over and over again in every play.","Film directors don't come to the theatre in Sydney. In London and New York, they do.","There are many books that I love dearly, and I've seen many televised or film recreations that I just haven't thought were up to scratch.","I think you've got to understand your character and where they're coming from.","Even if the Tonys aren't as glitzy as the Oscars, being a part of the ceremony is no less exciting.","I'm just a very fortunate actor who has not been typecast.","I think it's an actor's gift to be as old as people think you are.","I often get mistaken for all different kinds of ages; some of them flattering, some of them not.","I've really had a great career. It's been part fortune and part my own choices that steered my own career into playing the great roles that I've played on stage in Australia and at the National and West End in London and on Broadway."],"Estee Lauder":["Look for a sweet person.

As soon as it's out, everyone picks it up. It's important to stay true to yourself. Have fun with fashion instead of letting it dictate.","I kept my clothes on. I borrowed money.","I've been really lucky. When I decided to go to LA I said I was going to quit modelling and just go and see how I do. In the first two weeks I got three movies. I was so excited I had all my furniture shipped out from New York.","Because I was a champion swimmer in Canada, they're always trying to get me in the water in movies! I've drawn the line now with this film. No more water!","Yeah, I've had an odd youth, But I wouldn't know the difference if I'd lived it any other way. And I wouldn't change any of it because I quite like what I'm doing.","I like to go out and see what a city's all about.","You really don't do anything else in your life; it's a very little bubble that you grow up in. And you have to live in that bubble because of the intensity of the sport.","I suddenly felt the plane go down. I thought we were going to die. I was really scared. I was sitting with my head in my hands.","I thought, 'If I'm going to die, I'm going to videotape it.' So I got out my little video recorder and was taping goodbyes to my family.","I love the work, I love being in front of the camera and working with actors and directors and creating something. For me, it's like learning everyday.","I wanted to build up a little nest egg and go back to L.A. and choose roles that I wanted to do instead of roles that I had to do to pay the bills.","I think acting is definitely the most fulfilling, because it's the most challenging in my mind.","I really appreciate the sport background because the structure and the discipline that that gives a person is incredible, and it just carries with you wherever you go.","When I decided to go to L.A. I said I was going to quit modelling and just go and see how I do. In the first two weeks I got three movies. I was so excited I had all my furniture shipped out from New York.","Canadians have this weird way about them where we really stick together."],"Estelle Fanta Swaray":["Collaboration is the way to go. It's very timely and fun to do.","I never do a show where the people just sit there and look at me. They always sing along.

It's no fun to sing about things you don't like.","I went to New York and Miami and hung out by the beach, and I love the American boys, so I wrote a song about it.","I'm so, so full of joy that America elected Obama. He didn't win because he was black - people voted for him because he had a plan and because he talked sense and because you believed him.","Conservatives, they're like the Republicans to me.

The government is determined to break that pattern and is successfully doing so.","I think film is a very powerful advocate and message carrier.","What politicians want to create is irreversible change because when you leave office someone changes it back again.","I know there are things I did in education that will never be reversed. I have not done that in film yet because I have only been here for about nine months.","I want to give producers more financial security.","It is a very unusual sector and the one thing I would ask of them is to understand that for most of them one-third of their films are being financed by the taxpayer and that carries huge accountability and responsibility.","If you invent the Mini Cooper, pour all your energy and passion into it and it gets made, you should be on a roll. In the film industry you have to start again the next day.","If bringing up the next generation is important, why aren't they the best qualified, the best paid? Why aren't we as concerned about their career progression as we are about those who work in the education or health services?","You have got to attract the brightest and the best, but the brightest and best won't stay unless they see real career options.","In the 21st century when few of us stay in the same job all our lives, I would like to think there was flexibility so teachers could become social workers, or foster carers become teachers.","There is nothing wrong with becoming more ambitious along the way, but I think what the government has asked the council to do is a perfectly good starting point.","This government has always said increasing pay is something for something.","If we can modernise the workforce, make them better qualified, have this framework of qualifications, then I think they have a very good case for more money.","I taught for 17 years in an inner city comprehensive schools.","I was head of the Sixth Form Centre when I left the school.","We do recognise the need to move towards the publication of information showing the progress made by pupils from one stage of their education to another.","OFSTED has made large cuts in the paperwork which schools are asked to provide and further steps to reduce the bureaucratic burden will be introduced in September.","There is a shortage of teachers but the January 2001 schools census showed that teacher numbers were at their highest level than at any time since 1984 - and 11,000 higher than 1997.","I do recognise that, where recruitment difficulties persist, teachers can be put under great pressure.","I am confident that the vast majority of teachers will work with us towards achieving that goal.","The need for improved technical support in schools has expanded as the Government and schools have increased their investment in information and communications technologies.","My Department has already recognised this and has been working specifically on the technical support issue since January and will offer advice to schools during the Autumn term.","By creating useful job descriptions and making clear what qualifications should be expected, the Department aims to help improve schools' ability to recruit the right people.","However, the Government has made it clear that we do not encourage the recruitment of teachers from developing nations where there may be an adverse effect on the economy.","Headteachers and governing bodies run schools and that won't change.","Where the private sector, or anyone else, has skills, knowledge and resources that can help to deliver a high quality of education and to raise standards, we should use them."],"Estelle Parsons":["Don't forget the prices are so high in theater; it isn't really where a young person can go on a date and buy two tickets and take someone out anymore.","People who call themselves actors and can't ever get work; they do need to get another profession.","I believe in things that move people, if the audience isn't deeply caught up and moved to either laughter or tears then I don't think it is theater.","I know people like spectacle, but I'm interested in moving people.","For anyone with half a brain they can see that this play is about the human condition.","But today I felt different, today I forgot how long it takes to get into the skin of a character and I remembered it, because today I actually got into that skin and it felt so different.","You can't just trust to luck; you have to really listen to what that character is telling you.","In theater, the wellspring of the character comes from the doing of it, like a trial by fire, but in front of an audience.","At this point the theater America is in such a precarious place.","We all need to go to good theater; that is what I believe will save it.","All of the generations go to what is chic for them, and theater seems to be an older generation's art form.","Getting work in theater has always been sort of cyclical.","Acting is very start and stop.","I talked with Brian Stokes Mitchell, who agreed with me that if you have a gift there is always stuff to do.","I mean, there are times when you aren't working, but still believe that work will come.","I find that there are few reviews that extol women as wonderful artists.","I have never been interested in specific roles.","I like time off because I also have a life outside of theater.","There is some sadness for me now about acting because it used to be that there was a reverence for actors.","The staff, stage managers, ushers all behaved as if they respected the actors.","It is so important to get respect for what you do and at the same time give it.","When I see what I want, I do it.","I think in small towns like this one, whether you're a man or a woman, you basically do what there is to do."],"Estelle":["You can't please everybody. I give up. I'm not trying to. I don't care. Leave me alone with that.","I come from a family of well-endowed booty women.","John Legend is a cool guy. He likes to chill, is easy to talk to and hang out with. He's also inspiring on a musical level.","There is not enough faith in black music at a high level.","'Something Good' is a feel-good song. A reminder that you're dope and have something wonderful to offer life and yourself and the world.","No one goes straight to happiness after a breakup.","I got to the point where I was fed up with so many people telling me how and who I was supposed to be.","I can't stand quitters. My mother is a very strong, determined woman. I was peeling onions when I was seven, but I walked off when my eyes began to sting. She said to me, 'You start something and you finish it', and that stuck with me. I'm persistent.","I got into hip hop from my uncle; he was always playing us Kool G Rap and Big Daddy Kane. He was a bad boy, and my mum was not really happy that I was hanging out with him.","I've fully embraced who I am. I stopped fighting with people and just come to realize, 'This is me. This is all of me.'","With my music, I don't have to stay in one lane. One day I'm in Motown, and the next day I'm in reggae.","I always have to get my U.K. fix, and 'Downton Abbey' is definitely that. I absolutely love period dramas, but this one is particularly appealing - following the ins and outs of aristocracy as well as the interaction between the rich and the poor.","A lot of my girlfriends are always telling me they're really strong independent women, but they've got their boy on the side, and they only go over when he calls.","Success is based on music, not where you're from.","I've still gotta come across as happy when inside I feel crap!","Sometimes I wake up in the morning and feel like going straight back to bed. But I still have to get up and work, and I still have to take advantage of the chances I've been given in life.","My favorite film involving scarves was little Edie in 'Grey Gardens.' I often wear scarves like that, under hats.","We get older, and we forget that we have to carve a little time out to feel good in your body, in your head, and in your spirit.","Lesson one, introduce yourself to everyone when you walk into a room. Don't act like you're too bougie to say, 'Hello.'","I'm the female Jay-Z. I never compared myself to other women artists. I compared myself with the best, and the best is Jay-Z.","Me being a black girl in London, whose mom is first-generation African and whose dad is West Indian, gives me a different view. I'm coming at soul from my own place.","Adele ain't soul.","If there is enough space on radio for Busted and McFly, who are basically the same band, or for 50,000 versions of Stereophonics and Coldplay, there must be enough room for all of us.","When I was growing up, hip-hop was still a pretty specialised thing.","Reality really isn't as dull as it's cracked up to be.","You can be sexy, but respect yourself and make sure you get that respect.","Garage music came up when people weren't paying attention.","Law became boring, but like every job I've done, it helped prepare me for a career in music.","I would say my greatest musical influences have been Ella Fitzgerald and Mary J. Blige.","The reality show 'America's Next Top Model' is my girlie pleasure.","I love rom-coms. Any will do. Films such as 'How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days' or 'Funny Face' with Audrey Hepburn.","I always want to remain inspired.","I've always been a fan of Nigerian artist D'banj. He's now signed to Kanye West's Good Music label.","American food is not what I'm used to - everything is like three portions.","When I'm full, I stop eating.","The only thing I don't have is hips.","My style is Edie Sedgwick meets Grace Jones, or Audrey Hepburn meets Salt 'n' Pepa. Strong and feisty but still classic.","You know, sometimes you fall in love and you get treated badly, sometimes you get treated well.","Why should you stay in one place and one country if they're not offering you a job? It doesn't make sense!","I grew up in a house full of music. Everything from reggae and afro-beat to Zook and pop.","I wear and have worn scarves my entire life while traveling, working out, and now sometimes while performing, and not just on my head - I wear them around my neck and on my bag.","A lot of scarves are made to stand out and therefore not appropriate on your head, say, at work.","I'm not slimming down for anyone and losing my figure.","When my career slowed, I knew deep down it wasn't over.","My mum is West African, from Senegal; my dad is from Grenada. There was a huge controversy about them getting together.","I think the one group I am trying to appeal to is the world. That would be big enough.","I've always dug Audrey Hepburn. I think she's one of the classic beauties.","I'm never scared to ask a question or state the obvious, y'know.","I started writing an album on flights to Africa and Brazil, but it was crazy because I left the notebook on the plane. It had seven or eight songs in it. After that, I'm not writing any more songs on notebooks - and I keep my Blackberry close!","Walking round the Champs-Elysees late at night is the greatest time.","I'm used to traveling. I'm used to being in different areas of the world. Home is where my suitcase lands.","I never feel that far away from the tabloids.","The people at my label are always endorsing what I say. They say, 'You see the truth, so speak it.' They believe in me. They respect my opinion. At least I have an opinion, and I'm not trying to play it safe. I don't go around saying, 'I think everyone is great, and the world is fantastic.' Everyone has opinions. They just don't say it.","I'm so sick of hearing that U.K. hip hop doesn't get credit and success when I'm working to get it - for me and for others, too.","If you cannot smile when you listen to music, then do not listen to it!","People like the shows I do. I want to be real, to have fun, even when I dance on stage... it's a buzz.","I feel like I'm beautiful, and every woman should feel like that.","People want to say something negative before they say something good.","I want a TV series, I'm gonna do some acting jobs, I'm gonna do some Broadway jobs, everything!","People are getting ready for music that makes them feel happy again rather than being depressed at the way the world is going right now.","With the first album, I wanted to do so many different things, and I was fighting with myself to try and see if I was worthy enough to do it.","Parents, raise your kids. Young men and women, raise your kids.","I learned that working out gives me a space to get clear. It's not just about the body. It gives me space to process things and get clear in my mind about decisions and things I want to do.","Some days I might be wearing a little dress, and some days I might be wearing something with wings on it and be confusing.","I have to live authentically at all times. And that's part of what makes me an artist. I'm not scared to do that.","The people who have the strongest opinion about everything have never left their city, their town, haven't left their 'hood, haven't left their area, their corner of the world. They don't read. They've never left their house.","In order for me to write, I have to experience life. I write the songs based on real life, and I perform them from a very real place.","You have to have courage to look back and be honest about your own drama.","Americans have their issues with skin colour, even within the black community, with light and dark skin; it's crazy - but no one's oblivious to it.","If you think about where I'm from, I'm not supposed to be singing in the first place. I'm not supposed to be alive right now.","I'd really started hating music. I'd started hating all the songs, hating being in the industry, hating doing the shows. So I had to learn to love music again if I wanted to continue doing this.","I couldn't just hand in any old rubbish - I can't go on tour and sing something for three years if I don't believe in it.","I can sit in my room and write a song that I think might be a hit. I can sort of make myself do that, and then I'll play it to a friend, and they'll say, 'Oh, that's nice.' But when something happens to me, and I sit down and write a song to get rid of my emotions, they'll turn around and say, 'Wow, that's great.'","I try not to judge because I've been judged a heck of a lot, and it don't feel nice.","I'm signed to a U.S. label, and I didn't enjoy the 3 A.M. phone calls. I'm not a great sleeper, so I didn't enjoy being woken up.","If I don't agree with something, I let people know, and it occasionally leads to tension. But I usually iron things out.","For four years, my mum allowed only church music in the house.","I love singing, so I want to see how far I can take it. I love the challenge, and I won't be happy until I have a wall full of gold discs and seven huge world tours under my belt.","I am a black British female artist, so I must be like Ms Dynamite, I must be like Shystie, I must be like Jamelia, but we're all different.","This fame is a juggernaut: It slaps you in the face, and you don't know what you're doing. You don't know who has your back, who is your support system.","Luke James has this mystique about him that's not something you can explain; you can only experience it. He's got a whole D'Angelo feel to him as well.","Labrinth is a super talented singer, producer, songwriter from London.","I always say, 'There's a difference between cooked food and McDonald's.' Your mom's homemade dinner - you enjoy this more than you enjoy the fast food that comes along and goes, and I strive to make homemade dinner every time I put out an album.","I hate that if you do one style of music or become really well known for that one song, that everything that comes after has to fit that mold.","My mom, for all intents and purposes, was a single parent.","I grew up in a family of nine kids.","The Grammy snuck up on me. I was on tour. It just hit me. I skipped down the street in Vienna. I kept saying, 'I won. I won.'","I just have a way about me where people know that they don't tell me what to do, they kind of just wait for me to do it.","I remember being, like, the age of 7 and just always being in control of something or someone, a baby somewhere. I had lots of cousins and brothers, and we were all taught that's how you are, you know. Things don't just run themselves; you have to make them run.","Basically, if you go looking for trouble, it'll come find you.","I always thought that if record companies didn't understand me, fine - I'd go and do it by myself.","BMG has been an awesome partner throughout my career, and with New London, we plan to continue bridging the gap between soul, pop, London, and New York - uniting them through music.","I'm just excited that I get to put out the music I love versus music just for the sake of it.","I wear what I feel and what makes me feel happy.","I feel like it's not a bad average for every album I've got in the United States to be nominated for something off the album.","I think every artist strives for a record that crosses all energy, lines, boundaries or languages or barriers.","A lot of big whoever producers, they come with a song and they say, 'Sing this,' and I'm not that girl.","When I need things to happen, I need them to happen now, you know. I don't want to be having a meeting about a meeting about a meeting, which is what can happen in Britain.","Nobody's going to tell me to rap in an American accent.","The Americans love me because I'm so completely unwilling to change my whole Britishness.","I have my family; I'm never alone.","I believe in illusion - I don't believe in magic.","Kanye West is my older brother, an inspiring guy and someone who keeps pushing my level up further and further.","I will test a guy to within an inch of his sanity because I've been through too much drama. He has to be 100%.","I'm so, so full of joy that America elected Obama.","Conservatives, they're like the Republicans to me. They don't do much. They have this whole hierarchy and boys' club thing going on. That doesn't help the regular person.","The most personal track would have to be 'Love The Way We Used To.' It's one of the songs that I listen to outside of all the records that I wrote.","My songs are always about overcoming things, whether it's breaking up with a guy or just trying to be happy. They're always about being better.","People have created feuds between me and other artists.","Most of my thinking is done at night.","My mind is always going.","I can get a call at 2 A.M., and the person on the other end is like: 'Sorry, did I wake you?' and I'm like: 'No, I'm wide awake.'","The man for me has to have his own life or be as busy as me.","I will never say I am committed to somebody unless I'm serious about that person."],"Ester Dean":["I will make up a crush, you hear me?! I will look at a guy and say, for two months at least, 'I think you're cute.' And then I can be psycho. I will go in my head and make a whole life with him, he don't even understand why I'm mad at him. I'm like... 'cause you came in late last night!' And he's like, 'I don't even know you.'","I had so many beliefs against being a singer or what it takes. There was a lot of pain associated with that. The rejection of it all. I lived in a rejection state of mind. Not because of my voice; the mike never rejected me. It was harboring all those bad memories of being broke. It teaches you your worth. Nothing good comes from that.","I'm limitless, spontaneous and fearless. I can take direction and also give it. And I don't dwell on celebrity.","I normally work like a vampire. Around 8 to 9 P.M., what I call 'the spirits' actually show up, and then I just go in the booth and scream on top of a track. I only sing on the mic. I don't sit down and write anything.","People keep putting limitations on themselves and creating this reality that soul music is dead. That's only in their reality. It's not true. To me, Adele is R&B. Bruno Mars is R&B. It's just good songwriting and songs. That is going to last.","If I'm out of town and I'm in a situation where I have to be creative, it has to be hot dogs because that's my comfort food.","My nickname is Esta Bell.","I always wanted to be a psychiatrist.","My dream is to star in an animated movie and to have a toy made after me.","I've walked on hot coals with Tony Robbins.","I'm the only girl songwriter that fights for a lot of things. I fight for songwriting fees, which record labels want you to shut up about.","It's so funny because if you tweet your lyrics and then you hear it in a song next week, you're like, 'Hey I had that same idea.' I'm very secretive with my music. We have to send emails password protected. Because once that song gets out, you aren't selling that thing.","I'm more than a songwriter. I'm a creative person. Some people you just always see. I won't allow you to see me unless it makes sense. There's a reason to see me.","I see what other people do and what songwriters don't. They don't get out and take care of themselves. Producers turn themselves into a massive brand. Songwriters tend to be under someone else's umbrella. If you're building your own legacy, it can't be under an umbrella.","I'm not looking to be an artist to make money. I'm looking to be an artist.","I write by myself and then deliver the song. Everybody knows, 'Leave Ester alone when she's in her zone.' Give me a studio and the tracks, and I'll call you when the doctor is done.","I'm a very emotional writer. I always need to have a boyfriend. I always need to have some food. I always need to have a heater at my feet, and I drink this thing called Cool Brew, which I found in Louisiana. It's like condensed coffee.","I'm universal. As much as I can get out a 'Firework' with Katy, I can get a 'Lil Freak' out with Usher. Or a 'Lay It Down' with Lloyd. I can get Caribbean as I did on 'Rio,' then go from there to working with No Doubt.","I'm a songwriter who just wants to bring people great songs.","There are lots of people way more talented than me - but I work more, and I wanted it more. I never waited on anyone else.","I just write songs from the heart, and you never know who'll like the songs. I try to make sure that I don't allow anybody's expectation to weigh on me. I have my own expectation of life. I believe in letting people be free.","I always tell people I write songs, but I'm a writer. It's a difference. I can write songs to music, but I can write a story. I can see ideas spark in me."],"Esther Duflo":["The logic is that when you provide schools or any social service to people, they have no choice. They have to take what you give them, because they don't have the money to pay for schools themselves; that's why you provide schools in the first place.","Part of me always wanted to do something useful for the world. It came from my mother. She is a paediatrician and she was active in a small NGO for the child victims of war.","Paternalism is everywhere in our lives. We have to immunise our children unless we are upset about it. In India, it is the opposite. It is possible to get your kids immunised, but you really have to want to.","Giving more to women will, to some extent, come at the expense of men. People sometimes try to sweep that under the rug by saying you will create so much additional resources that everyone will be better off. I don't think that's true.","The differences in income between the poor world and the rich world are so great that people have to be interested.","In a way, it has been an advantage for me to be a woman because there is always some academic committee that needs you to fill a quota!","The poor get bored the same as the rest of us. Their happiness might be as important to them as their health.","I don't go to the beach. There is no value in going to the beach. If I did go I would probably read economics books.","I've never had a TV in my whole life. Television passed by me.","What is lacking in India are decent social services. The health service is a disaster. Education is a disaster.","For millions of girls around the world, motherhood comes too early. Those who bear children as adolescents suffer higher maternal mortality and morbidity rates, and their children are more likely to die in infancy."],"Esther Dyson":["What I'm thinking about more and more these days is simply the importance of transparency, and Jefferson's saying that he'd rather have a free press without a government than a government without a free press.","I think copyright is moral, proper. I think a creator has the right to control the disposition of his or her works - I actually believe that the financial issue is less important than the integrity of the work, the attribution, that kind of stuff.","Part of the problem is when we bring in a new technology we expect it to be perfect in a way that we don't expect the world that we're familiar with to be perfect.","It may not always be profitable at first for businesses to be online, but it is certainly going to be unprofitable not to be online.","I think that the use of copyright is going to change dramatically. Part of it is economics. There is just going to be so much content out there - there's a scarcity of attention. Information consumes attention, and there's too much information.","Change means that what was before wasn't perfect. People want things to be better.","Well, take the evolution of the Electronic Frontier Foundation. It began as hackers' rights. Then it became general civil liberties of everybody - government stay away.","There's almost no way of doing importing honestly, because if you do you're at such a disadvantage competitively. So people spend huge amounts of effort getting around stupid laws and not paying taxes.","Since I became chairman, I've tried to turn EFF into civil liberties and responsibilities.","Oh, that all the things my father had told me about how disgusting Washington is are true. And again it's the system - there are lots of nice, well-meaning people there. But it's a sleazy place. And politics is all about doing favors.","In the space of three weeks, I met a fair bunch of the guys who were just starting those little programmers' co-ops, and everybody was talking about starting businesses.","In the sense that people who produce things and work get rewarded, statistically. You don't get rewarded precisely for your effort, but in Russia you got rewarded for being alive, but not very well rewarded.","I've seen disgusting excess in business, and I've seen disgusting excess in Washington. But at the same time, I've certainly learned that Washington matters and that you can't ignore it, especially when you get into telecom.","I would much rather see responsibilities exercised by individuals than have them imposed by the government.","I think I have the right to know what Steve Forbes paid in taxes - I don't think there should be a law. I think there should be a presumption. I wouldn't vote for a guy who wouldn't reveal what he paid in taxes. That kind of thing.","I became a real free market fanatic. I'm probably less so now than even two or three years ago.","Having seen a non-market economy, I suddenly understood much better what I liked about a market economy.","From the business point of view - not to overstate it - intellectual property is dead; long live intellectual process. Long live service; long live performance.","But there is a corollary to freedom and that's personal responsibility, and the real challenge is how you generate that personal responsibility without imposing it.","And the Russians certainly don't have it. If a woman shows up in a fur coat, I just assume she's a crook. And that's me, the nice American. The assumption that you can't make money honestly is a killer.","A worker's paradise is a consumer's hell.","I joined the board of the Santa Fe Institute.","As long as a government can come and shoot you, you can't jump on the Internet to freedom.","Don't leave hold of your common sense. Think about what you're doing and how the technology can enhance it. Don't think about technology first."],"Esther Forbes":["Books are only the shadow and life the real thing. I believe this as strongly as any belief I hold.","I also believe that writing becomes worthwhile and vitalized only through a full and exciting life."],"Esther Hicks":["Most people are rowing against the current of life. Instead of turning the boat around, all they need to do is let go of the oars.","If you look in 'The Science of Getting Rich,' you see no reference whatsoever to the 'law of attraction.'"],"Esther Rolle":["We feel we have to put concrete on every inch of land. It disturbs the ecology, and it takes away the experience of a child going out into the woods and seeing all of nature.","I'm not so in love with material things that I'll do anything for money. That allows me the luxury of doing things of value.","My mother grew up with each of her children - whatever your age, that's the age she'd be when she listened to your stories. She never belittled our problems. It made for something permanent and reliable.","'Hollywood maids' are so idiotic. They grin at everything. I told Norman Lear I didn't want to play a maid because of that 'hee-hee/grin-grin' attitude, and he said, 'Who said I wanted that?' He told me he wanted two strong women that are the black and white of the same coin. I said, 'Oh, well - in that case, I'll be right there!'","I ruffle a lot of feathers. And I'm also selective - that makes you a troublemaker. But so be it. I laid a cornerstone for black actors, and that makes me happy.","I'm glad to take on the role of a domestic because many of your black leaders, your educators, your professionals came from domestic parents who made sacrifices to see that their children didn't go through what they did.","I don't play Hollywood maids, the hee-hee kind of people who are so in love with their madam's children they have no time for their own.","I don't take roles I can't respect. If I can't find a reason to be respectful of the character, I won't do it because I couldn't do it justice.","I had a wonderful father, and I couldn't bear that television virtually ignored black fathers."],"Esther Williams":["Somehow I kept my head above water. I relied on the discipline, character, and strength that I had started to develop as that little girl in her first swimming pool.","Once I married Fernando, I became invisible.","When you're out of sight for as long as I was, there's a funny feeling of betrayal that comes over people when they see you again.","I always felt that if I made a movie, it would be one movie; I didn't see how they could make 26 swimming movies.","Victor Mature was a big man; he had a great swagger. I liked him and I knew we'd be good together on screen.","I was 15, and the years of hard swimming had packed muscle on my frame and made me very strong. Not as strong as a football player, but strong enough to inflict heavy damage.","Three events. Three gold medals. I was news, big news, in the sports world.","Which Esther Williams do you want to hear about?","I took a job at the pool in order to earn the five cents a day it cost to swim. I counted wet towels. As a bonus, I was allowed to swim during lunchtime.","I never walked the streets of New York hoping to be a musical comedy star. For one thing, they would have thought I was too tall, because l was five feet eight and a half, and they were all little bitty things running around in the studio at that time.","I remember when I first walked into Mayer's cavernous office. You had to walk 50 yards to get to him, and in that time he could really study everything about you.","Critics established a snobbery toward me.","I was the only swimmer in movies. Tarzan was long gone, and he couldn't have done them anyway; he could never have gotten into my bathing suit.","I gave my eardrums to MGM. And it's true: I really did.","It appeared as if I had invited the audience into the water with me, and it conveyed the sensation that being in there was absolutely delicious.","I think it's so funny when people think they can't control a movie star. They can. We're just women, you know.","Widowhood had done nothing to curb my smart mouth. So much for diplomacy.","What the public expects and what is healthy for an individual are two very different things.","I always took it for granted that there would be life after Hollywood.","The wisdom acquired with the passage of time is a useless gift unless you share it.","We can't all win Olympic medals. Even I never won one.","Traveling to swimming meets took me beyond my small-town existence, gave me a hint of the exciting world outside of my own home.","Everything about my teenage life was almost ideal.","The newspapers loved pinup pictures of pretty young swimmers, and as a national champion, I got more than my share of space in the sports pages.","Life magazine ran a page featuring me and three other girls that was clearly the precursor of Sports Illustrated swimsuit issues.","I took my daily swim at the Beverly Hills Hotel pool despite the presence of onlookers.","Clark Gable was the first to have called me a mermaid.","I was all in gold sequins for Million Dollar Mermaid, 50 feet in the air.","By the time I got home at night, my eyes were so chlorinated I saw rings around every light.","With two little boys in diapers, I had to keep it simple if I were going to have a life at all.","I ended up buying a restaurant. Already we had invested in a gas station and a metal products plant.","There was a policy at Hughes against drinking at lunch, but the men ignored it.","Howard Hughes himself was a regular at the restaurant, and in a way it became his headquarters, too. Howard had recently relocated to Las Vegas, so when he wanted to do business in Los Angeles, he went into the back of our restaurant to use the telephone.","Even though I had a lucrative contract with MGM, I had a husband who was drinking and gambling our money away faster than I could make it.","My training in Science of Mind had begun with my mother. She took me to a different church every Sunday, and she encouraged me to question the minister afterward.","Marriage to Fernando offered shelter and security, but the shackle was the price I'd pay."],"Etel Adnan":["Colours exist for me as entities in themselves, as metaphysical beings.","We were taught to think that Paris was the center of the universe.","I didn't want to read French or write it; it was like a boycott, a rejection.","Once I put down a color, I never cover it up. If you are born a musician, why become a banker?","I always had a few people who liked what I did, and that was enough.","Usually, I am a compulsive person, and I need - sometimes urgently - to paint... Painting is close to poetry, is a kind of poetry expressed visually. It has to be spontaneous, rapid - at least in my case.","My writing and my paintings do not have a direct connection in my mind. But I am sure they influence each other in the measure that everything we do is linked to whatever we are, which includes whatever we have done or are doing.","I love Nicolas de Stael particularly, and my work can remind people of him. But looked at attentively, our works are not similar at all.","I write what I see; I paint what I am.","Mount Tamalpais became my house. For Cezanne, Sainte-Victoire was no longer a mountain. It was an absolute. It was painting.","Places are part of nature, of the bigger picture. We are interrelated. When we contemplate them in their own right, they can sometimes change our lives; they can become spiritual experiences.","Do what your inner soul tells you to do, regardless of any money or success it will bring you."],"Etgar Keret":["I see creative-writing classes as some sort of AA meeting. It is more of a support group for people who write than an actual course in which you learn writing skills. This support group is extremely important because there is something very lonely about writing.","When I started writing my stories, I thought that not only nobody outside my language, but nobody outside my neighbourhood would get them.","Being ambivalent doesn't mean that you're a relevatist, that anything goes; it just means that you show the complexity of life. Life is always complex.","I was first introduced to Kafka's writing during my compulsory army-service basic training. During that period, Kafka's fiction felt hyperrealistic.","I always have a story in my head that needs to be written, or at least I think I do. But I usually can't find the time to write it.","Being published in Arabic is a strong and consistent wish I have. I live in the Middle East and want to be in some sort of an unpragmatic dialogue with my neighbors.","Most of the Jewish writer friends I have are American, and I feel closer to them because they're always obsessed with one issue - identity: what does it mean to be an American Jew?","I used to feel that if I say something's wrong, I have to say how it could be made right. But what I learned from Kurt Vonnegut was that I could write stories that say I may not have a solution, but this is wrong - that's good enough.","In the army you feel violated - there's no private space. Writing was a life-saver, a way of recovering private territory.","What you experience in the army, aged 18 to 21, is what you take through all your life. You cross invisible lines: you shoot someone, get shot, break into people's houses. It's naive to think you won't carry anything into your life.","I rarely return to characters. My characters, at least most of them, are much more a part of that superorganism that is the story than separate and independent creatures.","Before I started to make films, I didn't give much thought to the way the characters were physically positioned in the story world.","I have to admit that talking authoritatively about my students' stories can make me feel, at times, like an astronaut who has just landed on a new planet and insists on giving guided tours to its inhabitants.","The reason I write is that I'm not in dialogue with my emotions; writing puts me in touch with myself.","My stories are very compact. I want them to say the most complex things in the simplest way.","Sometimes, when you are in a really constrained situation, it makes you more focused about what you want to say and where you're heading. The most beautiful love poems that were ever written are sonnets, composed in a very constraining form.","When I write a story, I have no idea what I'm doing. All I know is that I want to share something with my readers. The whole idea of writing is this place where you lose control, where you're irresponsible - it's a very liberating place.","Writing a story is kind of like surfing, as opposed to the novel, where you use a GPS to get somewhere. With surfing, you kind of jump.","In Israel, the role of the writer is dictated by the language in which you write. Writers see themselves as cultural prophets.","Generally, all my life, I have had strong friction with life - I was a problematic soldier, I was kicked out of the army, I was in fights. There was something about writing that was a way of experimenting with this emotion.","When I say a spoken Hebrew sentence, half of it is like the King James Bible and half of it is a hip-hop lyric. It has a roller-coaster effect.","In Israel, there is this reduction of the political discourse to something that is very limited. It's as if you have that pitch that only dogs can hear. Sometimes I feel I speak at such a pitch that very few people around me communicate with what I'm saying.","It took a lot to understand that the interest in both writing a story and reading it is not in the objective dangers someone takes. You don't have to fight snakes or wake up in a strange apartment to have a story; it's about what goes on inside your mind and soul.","I write in a slangy colloquial speech that has not been common in the Israeli tradition of writing, and that is one of the things that gets lost a little in translation.","I tried once in my life to write a novel. I had written something like 80 pages of it when my laptop got stolen. When I told people this, they acted as if something tragic had happened, but I kind of felt relieved, grateful to the thief who saved me from another year of something that felt more like homework than fun.","I don't have Facebook or Twitter accounts yet. Being a compulsive storyteller, I always make up for myself discouraging stories about how such accounts will get me into embarrassing and time-consuming situations."],"Ethan A. Hitchcock":["They should hold themselves absolutely upon the immovable foundation of truth and nature, whereby alone they can save themselves from misapprehensions and from the danger of being entirely carried away from reality into mere dreams and fictions.","Men wholly bent on wordly treasures were the dupes of their own passions, rather than deceived by the writings or pretenses of those who claimed to be Alchemists.","These men were religious when the spirit of religion was buried in forms and ceremonies, and when the priesthood had armed itself with the civil powers to put down all opposition, and suppress all freedom, intellectual, civil, and religious.","Notwithstanding this high Ecclesiastical authority, he who dared accept truth only because it could be proved, or proved to be good, and disregard authority, was commonly stigmatized as an infidel.","The intolerance of the Middle, and even later, Ages, is a fact all too familiar to every one."],"Ethan Allen":["In those parts of the world where learning and science has prevailed, miracles have ceased; but in those parts of it as are barbarous and ignorant, miracles are still in vogue.","Those who invalidate reason ought seriously to consider whether they argue against reason with or without reason.","While we are under the tyranny of Priests, it will ever be their interest, to invalidate the law of nature and reason, in order to establish systems incompatible therewith."],"Ethan Canin":["When I went for my medical school interview, I had an old paperback of 'Henderson the Rain King' in the pocket of my coat. I was wearing the best clothes I had - a pair of cords and a sport coat - but when I got to the office, all the other interviewees were lined up in their black suits.","I no longer practice medicine, but I can say that, for me, medicine was easier - and certainly less emotionally turbulent - than writing.","In medical school, you're taught to write in this convoluted, Latinate way. I knew the vocabulary as well as anyone, but I would write kidney instead of nephric. I insisted on using English.","It used to be you sat up in your attic and wrote and went down to a local cafe and talked with people there.","I teach a 14-week semester, and one of the things I do when I have to teach literature is, for the first half hour of the class, I have the students write the beginning of a new story every week. At the end of the semester, even if they have learned nothing about literature, at least they'll have 14 beginnings that they can take with them.","The only successful way to write, and the only one I have found, is to be the character. Give up on trying to control them. Writers always talk about hearing voices. That's what they mean.","The historical background is one of the easier aspects of writing a novel. Far more difficult is dreaming up the smaller, character-based scenes, scenes that rise entirely from one's own imagination.","One of my favorite ways to find fictional inspiration, by the way, is to browse historical timelines. I also like world atlases - any country with a squiggly coastline seems to inspire me, as do visual dictionaries, those reclusive creatures of the reference shelf.","In medicine, there's a fairly large but still finite body of knowledge that you need at hand for most of your daily work. It takes a few years to learn it, but once it's there, it's there. With writing, on the other hand, every new book - indeed, every new story - is a fresh and terrifying reinvention of everything.","No one knows why books do well.","It's nice when critics say 'Emperor of the Air' is an important book of stories.","Fame is a problem of perspective.","I was never writing for commercial success. It's nice that it has come, but it is not important.","I don't have a pen name, so I'm thinking of getting a doctor's name. What would you call that, a stethoscope name?","I like certain people's work better than my own.","Books were king, but now movies are king, and books are sort of ignored. So now there's no sense of a welcoming community where you live.","What's more interesting than the arc of lives?","'How does your life turn out?' That's the ultimate novelistic question to me.","I don't think success makes one confident. I think it has more to do with character than circumstance.","If you try to write a novel in L.A., you're a chump; everyone is speeding by, and you're driving a rickshaw.","No matter what writers say, most stories are about ourselves. The facts might change a little, but not much.","I like writing about the evil lurking in apparently good people.","Families tend to artificially divide the world, imbuing one member with all the attributes and another with all the faults. But it's never that way.","When I write, I can become this ecstatic, crazy fellow, hearing the voices and just loosening up and letting them grow.","A novel, at least for me, cannot be visualized at one time.","When the narrator says, 'This is a story without surprises,' most of the time, this is not what happens.","People are surprised when Hollywood characters act the way a real person would.","When you're in medicine - especially when you're a resident in a public hospital - you feel like you're doing your part. But not when you're a writer.","Writers of literature make very little money.","In the winter, I read next to a wood-burning stove. In the summer, we have a place up in Michigan where I like to read in a hammock. It's almost entirely hidden by cedar trees and right up by the water. You can climb in there and see nothing but water and be seen by nobody. It's perfect.","I think even great writers only write two books that you might like. When I think of my touchstone writers like Saul Bellow, I think of 'Henderson the Rain King.' With Don DeLillo, I think of 'Libra.'","Point of view gets me. If I can feel like a character rather than a reader, I'll read that book.","I can only remember two books from college that moved me: E.M. Forster's 'Howards End' and F. Scott Fitzgerald's 'The Great Gatsby.'","I like to write about the moment of light in the hour of darkness.","Medicine involves dealing with people who are going through changes and cycles, often people trapped in bodies that are going out from under them. Spending time with them lets you think their way, gives you insights as a writer.","I really enjoy the immediacy of the 'knife and gun clubs,' as they're so callously called. Emergency is a great place to learn about people.","There has always been a tension in my life between the romantic and the practical. I can't hole myself up in a cabin and write down ideas for the rest of my life. I also need to be able to clean out a dog bite.","Every time I'd sing or play piano when I was a child, my dad would yell up from the basement, 'That's B-flat!'","There once was this powerful, both capital and political, class who cared about supporting and affirming a solid middle class in this country.","I have a very bad memory. I can't remember my own life very well.","Fiction is about small ambition, small failed ambition, small disappointed hope.","Your first book is kind of a labor of ignorance. You don't realize the difficulty of it. Your second book is sort of a labor of fear. Then you sort of either hit a stride, or you don't.","John Cheever was the first writer I ever read who sort of had that similar sensation that, you know, life is nasty, miserable, brutish and short, but that occasionally, there's a certain river of light, a kind word, a telling gesture that sort of illuminates something.","Medicine ended up being the best thing I ever did for my writing.","There's a beauty to math. Math is so simple. It's just one step after the next.","I don't think there is such a thing as pure imagination. I think it's a combination of memory and invention.","Any writer who says he loves writing is crazy. Or lying.","You have to look at the value of different kinds of words. Adjectives weaken, and adverbs come even farther down the line. Verbs are strong; verbs and nouns.","Why say 'utilize' when you can say 'use'?","I've discovered over the years that being subject to both the adoration and the vilification actually makes me more disciplined. It makes me understand that it's the idea of writing a great book that propels me now, whereas it used to be the idea of success.","I'm a Jew. I think every Jew is dark in certain ways.","Doubt is the enemy of mania. It's trying to get aloft strung with weights. The moment I like writing is three sentences in, when somehow those weights drop away, and you can invent. I cannot tell you the dread I have.","I still don't know whether I know how to write a sentence.","Although I think I'm relatively happy as a person, I think there's something unhappy at the root of all my writing. I'd say optimistic but unhappy. Nothing that's particularly original, other than that we're going to live and die, and terrible things happen.","I was born in Ann Arbor. I lived for a while in Ohio; Pennsylvania, California for 10 years, and now in Boston. And I lived in Iowa for a couple of years, where I studied at the Writers Workshop.","It's such a risk to write a novel that it's easy to become conservative - you're spending what would be, for me, a couple of years of my life on a single idea. Which is maybe one of the reasons I write stories - if it doesn't work, you've only lost a month.","Bausch is a wonderful storyteller. He's a mature writer who has a lot of confidence in the quality of character. He doesn't need to hook you with a sneaky plot and zany characters.","I never set out to be a published writer.","Feeling useful in medicine allows me to not feel so stupid when making up stories.","I like medicine. Even if I was selling a million books a year, I would still be a doctor.","Medicine is a supremely useful profession. Fiction writing is not.","I don't want to be movie-star famous. I want to move people with my writing.","It's safe to say that all poets are manic-depressives, but fiction writers are on that scale, too.","I'm fascinated by power, by those that can be publicly generous and privately ruthless.","Mathematicians don't like it when they're associated with mental illness and sort of bristle when you say that they can't get along socially, that they're not good with people.","If you're concentrating so damn hard on a piece of mathematics or a musical - a piece of music or a piece of art, the restraint that holds the rest of - the rest of the world back off and vanishes in the rest of your life.","I think Bellow's the greatest American writer of his century, personally. When I read him, I'm in awe.","I think that's what poets try to do: They try to sidestep neurology and go straight to meaning.","It's the writer's job to disarm the reader of his logic, to just make the reader feel.","I think one of the battles for fiction writers is how much to invent or exaggerate.","Politicians are already exaggerated. They're bigger than life in every way - their appetites, their ambitions, their personalities, their failings, their magnetism. In a sense, they're made for fiction.","The Internet is changing American fiction - and I don't mean in some kind of metaphysical way.","I think one of the things that is essential for happiness in life, or at least for non-sadness, is producing something. I guess that's why I spend so much time and agony writing books. But working on carpentry is sort of like all the pleasure with none of the agony.","I'm becoming more of a novelist as I get older. The novel just seems the truer form. There's less artifice involved.","I started out writing stories because that's all I wanted to read, but now I don't know if I'll ever write one again.","A ten- or twelve-page story seems too easy, which is a funny thing to say considering that writing a decent short story is devastatingly difficult. Yet it still seems easier than a novel. You can turn a short story on a single good line - ten pages of decent writing and one good moment.","The short story can't really hold an interesting event. It can't hold a death or a war or a loss of great magnitude the way either a long story or a novel can.","You don't idea your way into a plot but plot your way into an idea.","My idea of teaching literature is just to read great passages aloud or to look at it the way a writer does, which is what I try to do. Which is to say, 'How does this writer do this? How did he order his scenes? Do you notice any pattern to his sentences?'","I'm a craftsman type of teacher. I don't like the thematic type of teaching that takes place in a lot of colleges.","I finished 'America America,' and I knew I had to write another book, not just for personal reasons but because I had a contract.","To me, point of view is everything.","I read for the sensation of becoming another person; I write for the same sensation.","As I write, I try to be the character.","You know that thing people say, 'poetry is the hardest, stories are the second hardest, novels are the easiest?' I'm here to tell you that novels are the hardest. Writing a novel is unbelievably difficult. It's nightmarish."],"Ethan Coen":["We tend to do period stuff because it helps make it one step removed from boring everyday reality.","It's always tempting to cast someone you enjoy being with. You've got to hang out with these people for a number of months.","What is striking in Minnesota is the invisible horizon line. On a grey day, when there's snow on the ground, the sky and the ground are one tone. Everyone appears to be hanging in mid-air.","When you're younger, you kind of assume you'll be fine at whatever. Then you get older, and you're either unsuccessful and you wonder why, or you're successful and you wonder why.","Two heads are better than none.","People respond to real problems from the heart.","We wouldn't have done it if we didn't think we could have fun with it.","Dave Van Ronk is not an obscure figure. He's the biggest figure on an obscure scene, playing a kind of niche music that we knew and liked.","There's something strange - not in a bad way - about going back to where you grew up or recreating where you grew up. It's strange and stimulating.","Of course, 'True Grit' is a Western, but we never considered our film a classical Western and honestly never thought about genre at all. We didn't talk about John Ford or Sergio Leone, even though we like their films. Really, we were driven only by our enthusiasm for Charles Portis's book.","'The Big Lebowski' was something we wrote for Jeff Bridges, and we set it aside for a couple of years because he wasn't available.","'I Love You, Man' was kind of funny.","In 'True Grit,' we had a vulture, a trained vulture... that was a pain and that was - even by vulture standards - probably a stupid vulture, and that was frustrating.","That's interesting: people deriving their identities from their music.","I mean, Joel talks to the actors more than I do and I probably do production stuff a little more than he does.","We haven't had to defend anything to anybody.","The mountain music... is compelling music in its own right, harking back to a time when music was a part of everyday life and not something performed by celebrities.","Being non-commercial is never an ambition. Movies come together at different points for fortuitous reasons. You do them as you get the opportunity, as opposed to doing them when you choose to or design to.","When the movie's done, you talk about either the score or source music over a particular scene, what might work. You just throw a piece of music over the scene, and we both listen to it.","There aren't reasons why you like this song or this piece of music, or don't like it. It's just, it's either right or wrong, you know?","Like any kind of writing, there are good days and frustrating days. But even frustrating days can be rewarding sometimes.","I have never had feeling in my toes. My uncle, Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf, once told me in confidence he had the same syndrome, leading me to believe it is genetic.","Dave Van Ronk, for those who don't know him - probably most don't know - was a folk singer. He's kind of the biggest person on the scene in 1961 in the folk revival in Greenwich Village, biggest person on the scene until Bob Dylan showed up.","It's more interesting for me as an audience member to see a movie about a loser.","It's not that I don't like TV. It's alien to me. I haven't watched a television show in decades.","It's tough being a Jew.","Whenever you're specific with ethnicity or religion, people find reason to take offence.","That cowboy look - the hat and the bandana - that's not a fashion statement. That clothing is purely practical.","We loved the language in Cormac McCarthy's 'No Country,' which is really about the region, while in 'True Grit' it's more about period: people did speak more formally and floridly.","Whatever faith you have, you have that crisis: what am I doing?","You don't have to have a true story to make a true story movie.","'Once Upon a Time in the West' is a great movie.","Midwestern Jews is a different community, is a different thing than New York Jews, L.A. Jews. It's just different. It's the whole Midwestern thing.","It was never an ambition to grow up and win an Academy Award, so when it happens, you go, 'Weird!'","Sergio Leone has this weird western opera thing.","There is some pleasure in doing a movie and problem solving on a specific movie and getting a movie made, but once they are done, we don't look at them again, much less relate one to another.","We used to watch the muscle movies on Saturday matinees, such as 'Hercules Unchained.' Then we'd go outside and do a remake of it.","Sometimes you can just hear the actor in the language.","We're not big on taste. And actually, if you don't pander to undue sensitivities, then it ends up usually not being much of a problem.","'Barton Fink' owed something to Roman Polanski. As a director, he always goes beyond the obvious narrative drift.","We've always actually been remarkably commercially successful. Not in terms of making huge amounts of money, which we rarely do, but in terms of not losing money and making modest amounts of money. We're actually strangely consistent in that respect.","I don't know we have a method. We show up at the office. Is that a method? That's about the extent to which it's been formalized, asystematised. We show up at the office and talk, talk a scene through.","We don't outline, so we don't have prospective tasks to divide up. It's just, we start at the beginning and talk the first scene through, write it up, proceed to the next.","Mainstream movies used to be more adventurous because people went to them.","It's hard to get away from being old. I still talk about the TV set.","It's very weird when people you know are in 'Star Wars.'","Barton Fink is just too self-important as an artist to get much sympathy.","All we think about is how to keep the audience engaged, and normally we're big on plot because that's the easy way to do it.","With 'The Big Lebowski,' we were really consciously thinking about doing a Raymond Chandler story, as much as it's about L.A.","It's important to tell the story you're telling in the right way, which might involve black people or people of whatever heritage or ethnicity - or it might not.","A writer, by definition, is pathetic.","People are always curious about brothers working together.","Is this business any worse than any other business? It's not especially bad.","We do worry that we might be making something we've made before. It's important that we make something we've never made before.","Oscars just ain't gonna do it for me anymore. I need the Nobel Peace Prize. The Oscars have worn off, man.","Don't bang your head against the wall about what you can't do.","As kids, we did see the Disney movies and the kids' adventure stories of the day.","You don't go around thinking about how characters in a movie, in the stories you make up, relate to people in general.","We go to the office every day when we're writing - or supposed to be writing. It's not always productive, and there's a lot of procrastinating, just staring at the wall, like any other writing. But we just make ourselves go to the office every day for more or less the whole day.","I think some superstars feel they get trapped in their established screen persona over and over again. That's what they get hired to do."],"Ethan Embry":["You can't think about things you want to change. Just be yourself.","You just have to do your own thing, no matter what anyone says. It's your life.","Real love is more than a physical feeling. If there's even the slightest doubt in your head about a guy, then forget about it. It's not real.","If did go back to school, I would want to learn another aspect of the entertainment industry like to become a producer or an agent, you need a law degree.","The first Matrix genius, the second one, what's up with the dancing? I haven't even seen the third one.","The Exorcist doesn't get me, but The Omen does.","For me, I've always taken being on a set as my school, because I've been working since I was ten.","Donner likes what he does and enjoys being on a set. He doesn't have to do it, its not like he has to make the rent. When I get to be his age and still enjoy what I'm doing like him, I'd be lucky.","I went to public school for like, one day. I don't get it. Everybody tries to be exactly the same. I think being an outsider is a good thing.","When I finish a film, I like to drastically change my appearance. I get sick of looking at the same thing in the mirror for months at a time. So when a film's over, I'll do something like shave my head.","I always play these rodent type characters - skittish and hyper like a chipmunk. It's a complete act though. I'm a very normal person.","Everybody tries to be exactly the same. I think being an outsider is a good thing.","I was home-schooled. But going to high school, I never would've been able to travel the U.S. or been able to do acting."],"Ethan Hawke":["It's difficult to do a genre film well, and it doesn't matter if you're talking vampire movies or 'Dawn of the Dead' or 'The Thing' or 'Escape From New York.' Those kind of movies, they understand what the old-school B-movie is supposed to be, they get the throwback of it.","When you start becoming really successful, the demons start to tempt you - the demons of vanity and self importance, drug abuse, the feelings of fraudulence. But, it's also a thrill. That's what I found weird.","If you can understand the inner life, then you can wear the uniform, the tattoos, or whatnot and realize that the things that are different about us become superficial.","When you do 'Before Sunset,' you know while it's a limited audience, there was a very small group of people that love 'Before Sunrise.' You feel a certain pressure to make sure that you uphold a level of quality that has been a bar. You set a bar and you have to at least match it.","The older I get, the more I realize how rare it is to meet a kindred spirit.","I'd be lying if I said I had confidence in every choice I've made, that I have faith in every film I do on every shot.","I always felt that a marriage works best at a farm... where you're together and everybody has clear-cut roles; they have chores, 'you take care of this' and you know. But it's hard.","My relationship to reality has been so utterly skewed for so long that I don't even notice it any more. It's just my reality.","In your mid-twenties, the paint is still wet on who you are.","The more kind of head trippy sci-fi. I always like that. I was a big 'Twilight Zone' freak.","Everyone has to pay their child support, and no matter if you're a Hollywood actor or anyone else, it's always a little bit more than you want to pay.","I kill flies, I eat meat, you know, whatever.","As a young man... you don't know anything about yourself. And add on to that, you're on the cover of magazines. People are interviewing you about what you think. You feel like a real phony.","I met a lot of famous people when I was about 24. And none of them seemed very appealing. And so I didn't know why I would struggle to be that kind of person.","It is very difficult for any couple who are married if both people are ambitious. I don't know if it's just too hard to be married to a woman that wants to be a movie star.","'Brooklyn's Finest,' this is the kind of movie that's why I want to be an actor, to tell real-life stories. This is where I feel my job is, to interpret life.","The thing that makes a great genre movie is one that's not just entertainment, not just horror or sci-fi or whatever. The ones I love are the genre pictures with some subversive message underlying it all.","I have had so many bad auditions.","I auditioned for Robert Redford once and I was so starstruck I couldn't even speak. I had a mic wire at a screen test clipped to me and then I got kind of nervous and I paced in a circle and then took a step and tripped and fell on my face. You just have to forgive yourself and keep going on.","To get to be somebody who gets to love what they do for a living, that's so rare, and so there must be some kind of price you have to pay.","The biggest problem in my life is trying to be the kind of man that I want to be, the father that I want to be, and how to process the failure of my marriage.","If I do three movies in a year, I don't feel like acting ever again.","I've had a lot of experience in independent film, and about how to choose. You've got to be very discerning about where you put your five bucks, and where you cut and what you don't cut.","One of the things that separates a good genre movie from a bad genre movie, I always think, ironically, is when you care about the people. The dime a dozen ones are where you don't have any awareness of the character.","Some people burn out, and some people like Clint Eastwood, he was a wild, international movie star in his 30s, and he's doing the best work of his life now. Go figure.","Right now, if you're interested in being a dramatic actor, they're not making that many just regular dramas. Movies have to have some other thing going on.","At every turn, when humanity is asked the question, 'Do you want temporary economic gain or long-term environmental loss, which one do you prefer,' we invariably choose the money.","I think having nature be a part of people's lives helps all of us see ourselves as part of something larger.","Nothing teaches you like getting leveled. And I got leveled in my early 30s. Nothing went exactly the way I thought it would.","I thought I was so much smarter than everybody. And I'm not.","I don't know what has happened to movies, but lately every movie is at least 20 minutes too long. It used to be that if you were three hours long it was because it was epic - a movie about Gandhi; something with very important subject matters.","I think it's my job to risk looking foolish. One of the things I've learned from the actors I've worked with is you don't get something for nothing. If you don't risk looking foolish, you'll never do anything special.","There's some kind of actors that can radically change who they are from movie to movie. I've never really been that kind of actor. I enjoy changing the worlds that I'm in.","The theater, for me, has always been a place where I'm free to be more creative, a place to sharpen my tools.","I'm horrified to admit that I just love Salinger. I was devastated to find out that other people feel the same way.","Right now the only people I can really fall in love with are people who don't really, truly want me around. Now why do I do that?","The girls who like me aren't the ones I like. Or, if I do and they want to commit, I suddenly need tons of time with my friends.","In New York, you've got Donald Trump, Woody Allen, a crack addict and a regular Joe, and they're all on the same subway car.","I think that if you walk through this life and I end up being a bad father, then it won't matter anything else I achieved in my life. It will all be irrelevant.","If my kids are doing well, then my life is going pretty well. And if my kids aren't doing well, it doesn't matter how the other elements of my life are. It's kind of amazing to have a context like that. This is really wonderful.","I did one sci-fi movie. I did 'Gattaca.' I liked 'Gattaca' because that was always the kind of science fiction I really dug, the non-action oriented sci-fi.","I remember being a kid and sleeping over at my friend's house and staying up late and watching 'Nosferatu.' Vampire movies are supposed to be secret and bad. They should be rated R.","When an analogy is really singing, it's what you want it to be.","If you're not a real chameleon of an actor and if you're not one of those guys who can really shape-change themselves all the time, one of the ways to keep pushing yourself and keep changing is to be in different kinds of movies.","It was never in my dreams to make my personal life anybody else's business.","I think that as soon as you think of yourself as a famous person or anything like that, you're objectifying yourself in some weird way.","We live in a funny time. If you don't go corporate, you can't compete. You're relegated as irrelevant. People used to admire that.","I was being taken around by a press agent at the Venice Film Festival at age 18. Was it fun? Sure. But it was a dangerous path to be walking on as far as having a substantive life. Because the casualty rate at the Venice Film Festival for 18-year-olds? High.","You know, I auditioned for 'Titanic.' Sometimes I muse on what would have happened. That would have been such a different life.","There's something about knowing life is finite that makes it so precious.","In all of our society, but especially in Hollywood, there is an obsession with perfection that can lead to self-loathing and neurosis and all that kind of stuff."],"Ethan Peck":["I love dressing up - it makes me feel good. I think most people get that feeling when they put on a well-tailored suit. It like, boosts your IQ, your confidence, everything. And I think that that needs to come back into the norm more.","Before, I had an idea of what I thought I needed to be, and I'm realizing more and more that being yourself is the best thing.","I went to NYU, and so I started to wake up to the fashion world when I got to New York. I mean, my fashion sensibilities were horrible; I experimented with some bad colors.","My mom's a painter, and she used to wear black all the time, and so do I. So I would say a black T-shirt with a pocket is my go-to.","I maybe convinced my parents to let me cut school once, but definitely, in college, I cut school a lot.","Some people assume I'm a spoilt trust fund kid who's never had to work for anything, while others think the best of me because of the good experience they had with my grandfather. It's difficult to digest the fact that they may never see me for who I am.","When there's so much freedom - financially and otherwise - smart kids get themselves into trouble. My parents did a good job of sheltering me from the negative aspects of wealth and success.","I remember meeting Roger Moore at my grandfather's house as a young boy and being impressed because I was such a big fan of '007.' But I was young, and I didn't have a perception of what celebrity was or who my grandfather was... I still don't, really.","I look back at the 1990s with its light-wash jeans, and I'm like, 'What...?'","I was such a dork in high school. I like - I played sports. I played in the symphony. I auditioned all the time. I was thrown off the sports teams for auditioning all the time.","I can't say I have had a ton of Hollywood exposure, as strange as that sounds. But by pure happenstance, I trailed Javier Bardem on a red carpet at a film festival in Palm Springs years ago. He's one of my idols, and I endeavor to walk an artistic path similar to his own.","I have 'The Economist' and the 'New Scientist' on my bedside table - and 'GQ,' of course.","My dad once showed me 'The Guns of Navarone' when I was a kid. I haven't rewatched it since, but it gave me such a warm feeling.","I feel very lucky. The older I get, the more I see how random everything is, the luckier I feel to have been born into this context; the more responsible I feel to be the best that I can be as a person and as a professional. That was a quality... of the men on my father's side of the family.","In a lot of ways, in high school, I was very much an outsider and never really felt like I fit into any particular clique or group, and so I found myself solo very often.","I was at a premiere, and these girls blurted out, 'We love your hair!' That made me laugh.","I never truly got to know my grandfather before he passed away, but he inspires me to search more deeply to understand myself."],"Ethan Suplee":["I have kids and I want to have a long life and there are certain things that are conducive to that and certain things that aren't. I've opted for the road of happiness and long life.","I definitely don't want to achieve some kind of rock star status.","I was born in Manhattan on West 12th. My parents were kind of hippies and they did a home birth.","The first few years I was in Vermont quite a bit, but I don't think I ever spent years and years there.","I'd like to just work - steadily work - and do parts that I enjoy doing.","I think anything Tony Kaye would've done would've been interesting, definitely. And worth seeing.","Tony Kaye is great with that kind of stuff. Up until American History X, he had only done commercials.","Tyrone, I think they're taking to festivals. I don't know which festivals it will be at. It's like a buddy picture. It's a couple of guys driving across the country and they get to a small town and they hit a guy. The guy turns out to be a drug smuggler.","As far as big egos, there are definitely guys out there that just think God only knows what about themselves.","But the drugs are kind of like taboo, at least among me and my friends and the people I've worked with.","But my favorite period for actors is the 70s. I think so many great movies were made in the 70s. The 90s just seem to be a confused decade. Nobody knows, really, what's going on.","Writing, yeah. Me and my friend Scott Bloom just finished the first rough draft of a script. It's taken us three years to do, but we finally got a first draft. And we'll see whatever happens with that.","I really like The Catcher in the Rye a lot.","David Bowie's my favorite musician. I love him above all, but I'm really into rap a lot right now.","I like the Wu Tang Clan a lot.","I want to be on a show that's as good as the one we're doing and that we get to make for many years.","I hope that people like us next year like they liked us last year.","I don't need to be on the number one show. Number 25 is fine.","I've lived a lot in the last 12 years or however long its been since Boy Meets World. I have a lot more to draw upon in playing Randy than I did playing Frankie. Although, I did have a lot of fun playing that role.","I really started trying to get my act together in August of 2002.","It was like there's got to be some way to stay working and stay productive in Los Angeles. TV is that kind of thing for an actor. Unless you get stuck in one of these shows where you have to go to Vancouver."],"Ethan Zohn":["I don't want fear or cancer to define me, but it's always in the back of your mind.","Cancer isn't going to slow me down.","I don't know if anything can really prepare you for 'Survivor,' but since I grew up as an athlete, the physical aspect came to me more easily.","I don't think 'Survivor' really changed me.","Soccer is my life.","If I can make an impact, I want to help some kids and bridge the gap between soccer and celebrity in America.","I know I want to help people and inspire people. That's my purpose in life.","My hair is my identity."],"Ethan Zuckerman":["If I use Facebook to stay in touch with my high school friends who are church-going Republicans, I may be getting more ideological diversity than in hanging out with secular progressives on the World Politics sub-reddit.","A common language is a first step towards communication across cultural boundaries.","It's fine to have social media that connects us with old friends, but we need tools that help us discover new people as well.","The benefits and consequences of globalization have a great deal to do with whether we're intelligent and thoughtful about how we approach globalization, or whether we're blindly accepting... or blindly resistant.","Moments of crisis, like the shooting in Newtown, tend to produce brief spikes of popular interest in gun control. My research on media attention suggests these spikes are extremely short-lived, and that they may be decreasing in intensity.","Engineering serendipity is this idea that we can help people come across unexpected but helpful connections at a better than random rate. And in some ways it's based on trying to reassess this notion of serendipitous as lucky - to think of serendipitous as smart.","There's no locality on the web - every market is a global market.","The uptake on mobile phones in Africa is phenomenal.","I can read a lot of French newspapers with Google Translate and have them read quite comfortably.","Sometimes you need the things you didn't know you needed to know.","It's my fond hope that social networks such as Facebook will help users broaden their perspectives by listening to a different set of people than they encounter in their daily life. But I fear services such as Facebook may be turning us into imaginary cosmopolitans.","It's become relatively commonplace to find corners of Africa that have good cell coverage but no electrical power.","On Twitter, if you want to quote someone else, you say, 'RT, re-tweet, that person's name, and then what they said before.' And it's a way of essentially saying, 'I'm not saying this, but my friend said this and I thought this was interesting.'","People generally pay attention to what they already know about and what they care about.","A world where everyone creates content gets confusing pretty quickly without a good search engine.","Google doesn't really forget.","If we need simple narratives so people can amplify and spread them, are we forced to engage only with the simplest of problems?","Teenagers try to hide what's really going on in their communication online.","Reading the text of my blog itself is not really the interesting part. The exciting part is how the Internet allows me to be the eyes and ears for the people sending me postings from Africa.","The U.S. media have done a shameful job of reporting on the Arab world.","I can imagine Iceland becoming a good place to run a controversial Web site. But... Iceland may find itself forced to defend controversial speech.","The Internet has become a bunch of interlinked but linguistically distinct and culturally specific spaces. There's some interface between them, but there's a lot less than there was years back when we were sort of pretending that this was one great global space.","You can make the case that slacktivism is important because it makes people feel affiliated to a movement and be part of it, and talk about it.","The Internet challenges traditional ways of distributing and processing information and so encourages new standards and behavior.","Curators are great, but they're inherently biased. Curators are always making an editorial decision. Those biases have really big implications.","Re-tweeting is a pretty common practice on Twitter, but on an average day, we see maybe one out of 20 posts is a re-tweet.","The Internet has not become the great leveller that it was once thought it could be.","When I was growing up in the U.S. in the 1970s, 35-40% of an average nightly newscast focused on international stories.","The wider world is a click away, but whether we mean to or not, we're usually filtering it out.","People want to be thought of as something other than a source of money. They want to be thought of as creative, thinking people.","For countries such as Kenya to emerge as economic powerhouses, they need better infrastructure: roads, ports, smart grids and power plants. Infrastructure is expensive, and takes a long time to build. In the meantime, hackers are building 'grassroots infrastructure,' using the mobile-phone system to build solutions that are ready for market.","Now if you're using Twitter or other social networks, and you didn't realize this was a space with a lot of Brazilians in it, you're like most of us. Because what happens on a social network is you interact with the people that you have chosen to interact with.","When you look at the 'New York Times,' you look at other elite media, what you largely get are pictures of very wealthy nations and the nations we've invaded.","When you sign up for Facebook, the service first searches for any mentions of your name and suggests you befriend anyone who has mentioned you in their posts. It then asks to access your e-mail account so you can connect with anyone with whom you regularly correspond.","I study the ways new media shapes people's perceptions of the world.","On the Internet, information from Indiana and India is equally cheap and easy to access.","Reddit, which calls itself 'The Front Page of the Internet,' is more influential in shaping Internet culture than its comparatively small reach would lead you to believe.","Reddit names are unconnected to real-world identities and it's commonplace for users to create 'throwaway' accounts to reveal sensitive information.","Wikipedia is a victory of process over substance.","Talking about 'stopping globalization' is unrealistic - and probably not what anti-globalization protesters actually want.","Increasingly, I'm inspired by entrepreneurs who run nonprofit organizations that fund themselves, or for-profit organizations that achieve social missions while turning a profit.","Creativity is an import-export business.","The term 'cyberutopian' tends to be used only in the context of critique. Calling someone a cyberutopian implies that he or she has an unrealistic and naively overinflated sense of what technology makes possible and an insufficient understanding of the forces that govern societies."],"Ethel Barrymore":["The best time to make friends is before you need them.","You grow up the day you have the first real laugh at yourself.","For an actress to be a success, she must have the face of a Venus, the brains of a Minerva, the grace of Terpsichore, the memory of a MaCaulay, the figure of Juno, and the hide of a rhinoceros.","Our achievements speak for themselves. What we have to keep track of are our failures, discouragements and doubts. We tend to forget the past difficulties, the many false starts, and the painful groping.","The face of Garbo is an Idea, that of Hepburn an Event.","The arts are not just instantaneous pleasure - if you don't like it, the artist is wrong. I belong to the generation which says if you don't like it, you don't understand and you ought to find out.","The great actors are the luminous ones. They are the great conductors of the stage.","You must learn day by day, year by year to broaden your horizon. The more things you love, the more you are interested in, the more you enjoy, the more you are indignant about, the more you have left when anything happens.","I never let them cough. They wouldn't dare.","Fundamentally I feel that there is as much difference between the stage and the films as between a piano and a violin. Normally you can't become a virtuoso in both.","That's all there is; there isn't any more.","When life knocks you to your knees, and it will, why, get up! If it knocks you to your knees again, as it will, well, isn't that the best position from which to pray?"],"Ethel Kennedy":["The Kennedys were very organized. Dinner was always served at 7:15, and if you were a minute late, it really wasn't worth it. In my family, you never knew when dinner was going to be. It could be at 7, or it could be at 10.","Introspection! I hate it!","When we lost Bobby, I would wake up in the morning and think, 'He's OK. He's in Heaven, and he's with Jack and a lot of my brothers and sisters and my parents.' So it made it very easy to get through the day thinking he was OK."],"Ethel Merman":["Everything's coming up roses - for me.","I wouldn't change one thing about my professional life, and I make it a point not to dwell on my mistakes.","Broadway has been very good to me. But then, I've been very good to broadway.","At one time I smoked, but in 1959 I couldn't think of anything else to give up for Lent so I stopped - and I haven't had a cigarette since.","I'll pat myself on the back and admit I have talent. Beyond that, I just happened to be in the right place at the right time.","Always give them the old fire, even when you feel like a squashed cake of ice.","Mom and Pop were proud of my popularity, but from their point of view, show business was no way to make a living.","I can hold a note as long as the Chase National Bank.","Legend has it that when God created me, he gave me a big distinctive voice, a lot of boldness and no heart.","Any audience that gets a laugh out of me gets it while I'm facing them.","I wouldn't trust any man as far as you can throw a piano.","I have been ambitious to be a somebody from the time I was 5 years old.","As far as dramas are concerned, it's considered passe for playwrights to turn out anything the average person can understand.","You gotta have a gimmick.","Who's happy these days?","When you are in deep conflict about something, sometimes the most trivial thing can tip the scales.","When I'm asked how to succeed in show business, I always say I haven't the foggiest.","There's such a thing as theater discipline. One player doesn't appropriate another's inventions.","There have been people who have tried to take advantage of me. They want to be linked to me just because I'm Ethel Merman.","The slapdash way producers used to assemble a show seems a little unbelievable when we talk about them now.","Once I had all the attention, all I had to do was deliver.","Of my four marriages, the one to Bob Levitt is the only one I don't regret.","My father taught me to read music and play the piano-but not well, even though people have said that I'm a natural musician.","My career at Warner Brothers consisted of one musical short subject. I was running around in a bear skin. Very chic.","My beloved Mom and Pop always rated tops with each other, and that's the way it will always be.","Music, in the past few years... anything singable or understandable is square.","Mom claimed that I could carry a tune at 2 or 3 years of age. Maybe she was a little prejudiced.","In my case, things have pretty much been handed to me.","If I feel in need of sleep, I just open a book or turn on the television. Both are better than any sleeping pill.","I've never suffered stage fright. That fascinates people.","I've never cooked. I can't do much more in the kitchen than make a cup of tea and some toast.","I've made a wonderful living playing that theatrical character - the professional brassy dame.","I'll admit - I was honored to be on the cover of Time.","I work as often as I want and yet I'm free as a bird.","I wasn't straining at the bit to become a movie star any more than I had plotted to get out of vaudeville and into Broadway musicals.","I was lucky enough to have the songs in my first show written by George and Ira Gershwin. Then Cole Porter wrote five shows for me.","I was born in my parents' bedroom on January 16. The World Almanac says it was 1909. I say it was 1912. But what difference does it make as long as I feel 33?","I preferred delivering my performance in person. I liked to be in control. You couldn't be in films.","I have plenty of invitations to go places, lots to do. If I'm not working, I go to have my hair taken care of and work at needlepoint.","I Got Rhythm really put me on the map.","I don't like to read. The only things I read are gossip columns. If someone gives me a book, it had better have lots of pictures.","I attend surprisingly few shows. The type of theater that is popular today just doesn't appeal to me.","I am known to be able to take care of myself when I become angry. I don't mince words.","Eisenhower was my war hero and the President I admire and respect most.","Cole Porter wrote Anything Goes and four more hits for me.","Cole Porter had a worldwide reputation as a sophisticate and hedonist.","Christmas carols always brought tears to my eyes. I also cry at weddings. I should have cried at a couple of my own.","At a flea market I always head for the junk jewelry table first.","I take a breath when I have to.","I can never remember being afraid of an audience. If the audience could do better, they'd be up here on stage and I'd be out there watching them."],"Ethel Percy Andrus":["The human contribution is the essential ingredient. It is only in the giving of oneself to others that we truly live.","We learn the inner secret of happiness when we learn to direct our inner drives, our interest and our attention to something besides ourselves."],"Ethel Waters":["We are all gifted. That is our inheritance.","Today or any day that phone may ring and bring good news.","Nothing can beat the smell of dew and flowers and the odor that comes out of the earth when the sun goes down.","It has been an ache and a joy both to look over this big shoulder of mine at all my yesterdays.","Mom never quit on me. My only regret is that she didn't live long enough to share some of the money and comforts my work in show business has brought me.","All the men in my life have been two things: an epic and an epidemic.","When you dominate other people's emotions, the time has to come when you will have to pay, and heavily, for that privilege.","I have reason to be shy. I've been hurt plenty.","I have no acting technique I act instinctively. That's why I can't play any role that isn't based on something in my life.","My whole family could sing. My family harmonized without any instruments to accompany them.","Though I was excited about the Sojourner Truth play, it was not reassuring to think that my entire future might depend on the success of that one show.","I never accepted the idea that I was all through. I guess no person who has once been a star can do that, ever.","Somehow, the things my mother wanted to do, the release in evangelism she sought with such frenzy, were transferred to me.","New York is only 97 miles from Philadelphia but was the Big Time as no other American city has ever been.","I want affection and tenderness desperately, but there's something in me that prevents me from handing it out.","Elia Kazan understood my problems. He was able to bring out the very best in me. He gave me credit for my intelligence.","Asking what I considered an impossible salary when I didn't want to work for someone has boosted my pay again and again.","I never felt I belonged. I was always an outsider.","You are a person of the greatest importance when you are a mother of a family. Just do your job right and your kids will love you.","I wanted to be with the kind of people I'd grown up with, but you can't go back to them and be one of them again, no matter how hard you try.","Basically there is no difference between whites and blacks, browns and yellows. I decided to think no more of people as Northerners and Southerners.","Whenever I played Columbus, Ohio, I dropped in to see my close friend, a medium who had mysterious powers. Her Indian guide was Mohawk.","We never had a bathtub. Mom would bathe me in the wooden or tin washtub in the kitchen, or in a big lard can.","There's no hypocrisy in Hell's Kitchen.","There was one emotional outlet my people always had when they had the blues. That was singing.","There is a great supply of amateur undertakers in show business.","The white audiences thought I was white, my features being what they are, and at every performance I'd have to take off my gloves to prove I was a spade.","The big compliment came from the beer drinkers who didn't know me. They wouldn't drink or move when I sang. If they had their glasses in mid-air, the glasses wouldn't come down.","No one in the world can beat Ella Fitzgerald as a riff singer.","Negroes are human beings with exactly the same faults and virtues as members of the other races.","Mom was the greatest influence of my childhood. She wanted to save me from the vice, lust, and drinking that was all about me.","In her whole life Mom never earned more than five or six dollars a week. Being without a husband, it was hard for her to find any place at all for us to live.","I've never been able to feel that there is anything undignified about making your living by the sweat of your brow.","I never was coddled, or liked, or understood by my family.","I never was a child.","I had always loved John Ford's pictures. And I came to love him, too, but I was frightened to death working for him. He used the shock treatment while directing me.","I cannot help feeling I would have been happier with a husband and chidren of my own.","I am an isolationist.","All my life I've been prejudiced against wealthy people.","After years in white theaters I dreaded working in colored houses. The noise, the stomping, whistling, and cheering that hadn't annoyed me when I was young was now something I dreaded."],"Ethel Watts Mumford":["God gives us our relatives, thank God we can choose our friends.","Knowledge is power, if you know it about the right person.","The greatest possession is self-possession."],"Etienne Schneider":["Fishermen own the fish they catch, but they do not own the ocean.","I have more than 70 space companies in the pipeline.","Luxembourg is such a small country that we always have to reinvent ourselves and take on a certain risk to succeed.","Luxembourg's aims is to be in the top 10 space-faring nations in the world.","In 1985, the government decided to launch the first satellite. We had huge discussions then that nobody would need that kind of satellite or that it could fall from the sky.","Asteroids are often seen as a threat, but they are also an opportunity. The use of space resources holds a large potential for future technological innovation.","Luxembourg is the first adopter in Europe of a legal and regulatory framework recognizing that space resources are capable of being owned by private companies.","London is a very important financial centre.","Luxembourg has always been a country that has tried to reinvent its own future.","We will support the long-term economic development of new, innovative activities in the space and satellite industries as a key high-tech sector for Luxembourg.","Our aim is to open access to a wealth of previously unexplored mineral resources on lifeless rocks hurling through space, without damaging natural habitats.","Luxembourg has a track record of being successful when it takes risks. You need to take on risks to be successful.","In the long term, space resources could lead to a thriving new space economy and human expansion into the solar system."],"Etta James":["I wanna show that gospel, country, blues, rhythm and blues, jazz, rock 'n' roll are all just really one thing. Those are the American music and that is the American culture.","It feels so good to be happy.","The only time that I am really truly happy - when I feel at my best - is when I'm on the stage.","It's not about battling the original artists when I record these songs, it's about paying tribute to them.","Long as I was riding in a big Cadillac and dressed nice and had plenty of food, that's all I cared about.","When I sing for myself, I probably sing for anyone who has any kind of hurt, any kind of bad feelings, good feelings, ups and downs, highs and lows, that kind of thing.","You can't fake this music. You might be a great singer or a great musician but, in the need, that's got nothing to do with it. It's how you connect to the songs and to the history behind them.","I sing the songs that people need to hear.","I'm not starry eyed, and I'm not money crazy.","What happens is, when I perform, I'm somewhere else. I go back in time and get in touch with who I really am. I forget my troubles, my worries.","My mother was a jazz fanatic and she wanted me to play the piano so I could play jazz tunes. I wish I had learned but I was too busy getting into trouble!","My mother always told me, even if a song has been done a thousand times, you can still bring something of your own to it. I'd like to think I did that.","Most of the songs I sing, they have that blue feeling to it. They have that sorry feeling. And I don't know what I'm sorry about.","Jazz took too much discipline. You have to come in at the right place, which is different than me singing the blues, where I can sing, 'Oh, baby,' if there's a pause in the melody. With jazz, you better leave that space open, or put in something real cool.","People always say 'Etta, you know what your problem is? You're neither fish nor fowl. There is no place to rack you.' When I would go in a record shop, you might find one or two records by me in different stacks.","Once you lose the weight, you're really anxious to eat healthy.","All the things I used to like - cookies, ice cream, gumbo - I don't like anymore.","When I'm performing for the people, I am me, then. I am that little girl who, when she was five years old, used to sing at church. Or I'm that 15-year-old young lady who wanted to be grown and wanted to sing and couldn't wait to be smokin' a cigarette, you know?","When I look out at the people and they look at me and they're smiling, then I know that I'm loved. That is the time when I have no worries, no problems.","They said that Etta James is still vulgar. I said, Oh, how dare them say I'm still vulgar. I'm vulgar because I dance in the chair. What would they want me to do? Want me to just be still or something like that? I've got to do something.","That's where it begins and ends for me and these songs were the ones that touched me the deepest. It was like I was laying hold of some part of me that I didn't even know was there until I let it out.","Most of the songs I sing have that blues feeling in it. They have that sorry feeling. And I don't know what I'm sorry about. I don't.","It's the same thing now. When I go onstage the young people scream and holler as much as the older generation.","I'm not a braggart, but when I was a little girl people used to come from all over Hollywood to hear me sing.","I like to shop, but I don't like to go out to dances.","I don't care who's playing. Even if it's my favorite artist, I'm probably not gonna go and see him.","I am so happy that I am alive and can walk.","But even so, I still get nervous before I go onstage.","And as I started reaching deeper I realized that most of the blues of that day was done by men. Women just didn't have the nerve.","This is an album of songs that I've always loved, tunes that I heard. For the first time in 53 years of recording, I really had control over an entire album, start to finish.","Now I can stand up on the stage again like I used to after five years of sitting down while I sang.","My mother always wanted me to be glamorous. When I thought about that, it really fired me up, and once I lost all those pounds, I started to feel really good about myself.","Johnny Guitar... just one of my favorite singers of all time. I met him when we were both on the road with Johnny Otis in the '50s when I was a teenager. We traveled the country in a car together. I would hear him sing every night.","I talked to the record company about what I had in mind. They said they wanted something lush. I figured the best thing to do was let them hear what I had in mind.","I figured I could do 'It's A Man's Man's Man's World', because I believe it's the truth.","Bobby Womack is always very real, both with his music and as a person.","A few years ago, I thought, I'll never make it. I started to go to the doctor to help me lose weight.","I took back my life.","I was originally like a punker, know what I mean, like the punks are today, I'd spit in a minute.","I'm not a bourgeois person, never will be.","See, I don't like places where people can't dance - don't like clubs or theatres where a bunch of bourgeois people sit around tip, tip, tipping their fingers.","I really turned into, you know, the real street kid. I was kind of like a runaway, but I had a mother, you know what I mean, and I had a place to stay.","I was a sloppy kid, wanted to be just wild.","Even as a little child, I've always had that comedian kind of attitude.","My mother used to play nothing but Billie Holiday.","Country music has the great stories.","To me, country music is like the blues, but it's something very hip and - I don't want to say commercial - but it's very worldly and good listening."],"Etty Hillesum":["Every day I shall put my papers in order and every day I shall say farewell. And the real farewell, when it comes, will only be a small outward confirmation of what has been accomplished within me from day to day.","Sometimes the most important thing in a whole day is the rest we take between two deep breaths.","I think what weakens people most is fear of wasting their strength.","Ultimately, we have just one moral duty: to reclaim large areas of peace in ourselves, more and more peace, and to reflect it towards others. And the more peace there is in us, the more peace there will be in our troubled world.","Greed probably figures in my intellectual life as well, as I attempt to absorb a massive amount of information with consequent mental indigestion."],"Eubie Blake":["Be grateful for luck. Pay the thunder no mind - listen to the birds. And don't hate nobody.","Never trust anyone who wants what you've got. Friend or no, envy is an overwhelming emotion.","I don't have any bad habbits.

For all serious daring starts from within.","Greater than scene is situation. Greater than situation is implication. Greater than all of these is a single, entire human being, who will never be confined in any frame.","Writing a story or a novel is one way of discovering sequence in experience, of stumbling upon cause and effect in the happenings of a writer's own life.","I am a writer who came of a sheltered life. A sheltered life can be a daring life as well. For all serious daring starts from within.","Writers and travelers are mesmerized alike by knowing of their destinations.","It had been startling and disappointing to me to find out that story books had been written by people, that books were not natural wonders, coming of themselves like grass.","Beware of a man with manners.","Writing fiction has developed in me an abiding respect for the unknown in a human lifetime and a sense of where to look for the threads, how to follow, how to connect, find in the thick of the tangle what clear line persists."],"Eugen Herrigel":["Far from wishing to awaken the artist in the pupil prematurely, the teacher considers it his first task to make him a skilled artisan with sovereign control of his craft.","Assuming that his talent can survive the increasing strain, there is one scarcely avoidable danger that lies ahead of the pupil on his road to mastery.","He grows daily more capable of following any inspiration without technical effort, and also of letting inspiration come to him through meticulous observation.","The more obstinately you try to learn how to shoot the arrow for the sake of hitting the goal, the less you will succeed in the one and the further the other will recede.","This means that the mind or spirit is present anywhere, because it is nowhere attached to any particular place. And it can remain present because, even when related to this or that object, it does not cling to it by reflection and thus lose its original mobility."],"Eugene Cernan":["Curiosity is the essence of human existence. 'Who are we? Where are we? Where do we come from? Where are we going?'... I don't know. I don't have any answers to those questions. I don't know what's over there around the corner. But I want to find out.","Some of the most exciting space education in the country is not coming out of Washington or New York or California or even Texas. It's coming from a place in Kansas called the Cosmosphere.","After Apollo 17, America stopped looking towards the next horizon. The United States had become a space-faring nation, but threw it away. We have sacrificed space exploration for space exploitation, which is interesting but scarcely visionary.","Nobody can take those footsteps I made on the surface of the moon away from me.","Here I am at the turn of the millennium and I'm still the last man to have walked on the moon, somewhat disappointing. It says more about what we have not done than about what we have done.","I was a child of World War Two . I saw films of pilots taking off from aircraft carriers and decided that was the only thing I wanted to do. And it had to be flying from sea carriers. Airfields were not enough.","To become an astronaut, someone has to have a dream of his own to do something that he or she has always wanted to do, then commit himself to making that dream come true.","One of the most important things about the geology on the moon is your descriptions of what you see, comparing them to things that you've seen on Earth so that the geologists and the scientists on the ground would know what you're talking about; and then take pictures of them.","I do believe there is life in outer space. Mathematically, there has to be, and if you believe as I do that there is a creator of the universe, then how can we be so arrogant to believe he created life here and nowhere else?","If you begin to think you're something you're not, you're looking in the wrong mirror.","Perhaps the two greatest moments of my life were standing on the moon and being outside of the room when my granddaughter was born! We tend not to remember the worst.","People try to typecast astronauts as heroic and superhuman. We're only human beings.","It's our destiny to explore. It's our destiny to be a space-faring nation.","The moon is bland in color. I call it shades of gray. You know, the only color we see is what we bring or the Earth, which is looking down upon us all the time. And to find orange soil on the moon was a surprise.","Some astronauts describe the routine flushing of urine into space, where the freezing temperatures turn the droplets into a cloud of bright, drifting crystals, as being among the most amazing sights they saw on an entire voyage.","Get the shuttle out of the garage. It's in its prime of its life. How could we just put it away?","When you head on out to the Moon, in very short order, and you get a chance to look back at the Earth, that horizon slowly curves around in upon himself, and all of sudden you're looking at something that is very strange, but yet is very, very familiar, because you're beginning to see the Earth evolve.","We went into darkness after being in daylight the whole time on the way to the Moon. And then we went into darkness. And we're in the shadow... of the Moon.","As we leave the Moon at Taurus-Littrow, we leave as we came, and God willing, as we shall return, with peace and hope for all mankind.","I'm quite disappointed that I'm still the last man on the moon.","We will certainly see teachers, journalists, artists and poets in space. Whatever it takes to the be the best is what it will take to get you into space.","We leave as we came and, god willing, as we shall return, with peace, and hope for all mankind.","Today, we are on a path of decay. We are seeing the book close on five decades of accomplishment as the leader in human space exploration.","Am I willing to go to Mars? Yes, but I'm not willing to spend nine months getting there, then wait 18 more months until the planets align to come home.","We found out the Gemini spacesuit was, well, oxygen was flowing to keep me cool as well as to breathe, and it wasn't good enough. My visor got fogged.","The countdown reached ten seconds and I could almost hear an invisible crescendo of stirring background music. 'Anchors aweigh!' Five, four, three, two, one... and we had ignition!","We don't have the capability today to put a human being in space of any kind, shape or form, which is absolutely, totally unacceptable when we got the greatest flying machine in the world sitting down at Kennedy in a garage there with nothing to do.","I hold the world speed record downhill, in a Rover. I think it was 17 kilometers per hour, downhill.","If the guidance failed or started to stray or went somewhere we didn't like or the ground didn't like, I could flip a switch, and I could control seven, over seven and a half million pounds of thrust with this handle and fly the thing to the Moon myself.","Neil Armstrong was probably one of the most human guys I've ever known in my life.","NASA has been scattered to the four winds.","Mom was always doing something for somebody. She came from a Czech background, one that made her a devout Catholic and gave her a strong belief in the family.","I think America has a responsibility to maintain its leadership in technology and its moral leadership in the world, to explore, to seek knowledge.","Chemical propulsion is obsolete to go anywhere other than the moon. Three days - that's acceptable. But for Mars, we need propulsion technologies to get us there in, say, 60 days - then spend whatever length of time we want to spend and return when we want to come home."],"Eugene Chadbourne":["I do the protest stuff. I do country and western. I play both acoustic and electric guitar in a lot of different styles, from loud, psychedelic stuff to quiet finger-picking.","There are no bridges in folk songs because the peasants died building them.","There's no type of music I don't like. I think it's important to be able to make fun of all types.","I play these sort of comical instruments I invented, like the electric rake and the electric plunger. I do a lot of almost stand-up comedy material. Just the juxtaposition of the different styles in itself sometimes is funny. Like, I do sort of an acoustic version of 'Purple Haze' that has some bluegrass licks in it.","People love the electric rake. You just hit it or whatever you want to do. You can't play 'Swanee River' on it. You have to just make terrible noise. Occasionally, it will make a sound like a note.","I think dissonance in music makes you think. It isn't, 'Oh, that's a pretty melody I can whistle.' You have to sit down and listen to tell it apart from other things.","I started using contact microphones that you can place on common, ordinary objects, like a rake. I put a microphone on it and it picked up the tines vibrating and turned it into a horrible din. What attracted me to it was the horrible din - that's what I really liked.","Can you imagine a guy breaking into your car, and he steals your guitar case 'cause he thinks it's a guitar, and he gets it home and opens it up and there's a rake inside it, an electric toilet plunger and a dog skull? That actually happened.","I want to be taken seriously as the type of musician that plays stuff like an electric rake. I mean, how seriously do you take someone like Spike Jones? They take him pretty seriously - a really good musician who made a great contribution in terms of humor, which is part of what I try to do too.","Sometimes you have trouble because someone 'likes' your music so much. They follow you around for hours singing little bits of the songs, or just freaking out."],"Eugene Delacroix":["Talent does whatever it wants to do. Genius does only what it can.","Do not be troubled for a language, cultivate your soul and she will show herself.","Nature is a dictionary; one draws words from it.","A taste for simplicity cannot endure for long.","The artist who aims at perfection in everything achieves it in nothing.","If one considered life as a simple loan, one would perhaps be less exacting. We possess actually nothing; everything goes through us.","What moves those of genius, what inspires their work is not new ideas, but their obsession with the idea that what has already been said is still not enough.","Do all the work you can; that is the whole philosophy of the good way of life."],"Eugene Fama":["In an efficient market, at any point in time, the actual price of a security will be a good estimate of its intrinsic value.","People are always saying that prices are too high. When they turn out to be right, we anoint them. When they turn out to be wrong, we ignore them. They are typically right and wrong about half the time.","Debates go on to this day about what caused the Great Depression. Economics is not very good at explaining swings in economic activity.","I don't know what a credit bubble means. I don't even know what a bubble means. These words have become popular. I don't think they have any meaning.","After costs, only the top 3% of managers produce a return that indicates they have sufficient skill to just cover their costs, which means that going forward, and despite extraordinary past returns, even the top performers are expected to be only as good as a low-cost passive index fund. The other 97% can be expected to do worse.","An investor doesn't have a prayer of picking a manager that can deliver true alpha.","State constitutions typically provide that the state first has to service its debt, then make it pension payments, and then pay for services. What we don't know is whether that order will be enforced. And ultimately, the busted state is going to be looking to the federal government for a bailout. Think Greece, but on a much bigger scale.","Economies typically do not function well in hyperinflation. The real value of government debt might disappear, but the economy is likely to disappear with it.","People don't walk away from their homes unless they can't make the payments. That's an indication that we are in a recession.","I don't believe anyone wants to hear what I have to say.","I'm an extreme libertarian, but I realize we're in a democracy, and in a democracy, people can have views of all stripes, and there's no reason to argue about it."],"Eugene Field":["He played the King as though under momentary apprehension that someone else was about to play the ace.","Ideas came with explosive immediacy, like an instant birth. Human thought is like a monstrous pendulum; it keeps swinging from one extreme to the other.","Here we have a baby. It is composed of a bald head and a pair of lungs."],"Eugene H. Peterson":["If you don't take a Sabbath, something is wrong. You're doing too much, you're being too much in charge. You've got to quit, one day a week, and just watch what God is doing when you're not doing anything.","If you keep the Sabbath, you start to see creation not as somewhere to get away from your ordinary life, but a place to frame an attentiveness to your life.","One way to define spiritual life is getting so tired and fed up with yourself you go on to something better, which is following Jesus.","The most important thing a pastor does is stand in a pulpit every Sunday and say, 'Let us worship God.' If that ceases to be the primary thing I do in terms of my energy, my imagination, and the way I structure my life, then I no longer function as a pastor.","People are not problems to be solved. They are mysteries to be explored.","The role of the pastor is to embody the gospel. And of course to get it embodied, which you can only do with individuals, not in the abstract.","In high school I was very much involved in poetry. You cannot read a poem quickly. There's too much going on there. There are rhythms and alliterations. You have to read poetry slow, slow, slow to absorb it all.","That's the whole spiritual life. It's learning how to die. And as you learn how to die, you start losing all your illusions, and you start being capable now of true intimacy and love.","I believe God takes the things in our lives - family, background, education - and uses them as part of his calling. It might not be to become a pastor. But I don't think God wastes anything.","The minute the church and pastors start saying what do people want and then giving it to them, we betray our calling. We're called to have people follow Jesus. We're called to have people learn how to forgive their enemies.","American culture is probably the least Christian culture that we've ever had because it is so materialistic and it's so full of lies. The whole advertising world is just, it's just intertwined with lies, appealing to the worst of the instincts we have.","I cannot fail to call the congregation to worship God, to listen to his Word, to offer themselves to God.","Religion is a very scary thing, because a pastor is in a position of power. And if you use that power badly, you ruin people's lives, and you ruin your own life.","Spirituality is no different from what we've been doing for two thousand years just by going to church and receiving the sacraments, being baptized, learning to pray, and reading Scriptures rightly. It's just ordinary stuff.","There's nobody who doesn't have problems with the church, because there's sin in the church. But there's no other place to be a Christian except the church.","I get asked, 'What do you miss most about being a pastor?' I think it's the intimacy, the incredible gift of intimacy. You go through death with somebody, with their families, and there's an intimacy that comes through that that is just incomparable.","When you are part of a megachurch, you have no responsibility to anybody else.","If people don't know their pastor, it's easy to put the pastor on a pedestal and depersonalize him or her. It's also easy for pastors, who don't know their congregations, simply to classify congregants as saved or unsaved, involved or not involved, tithers or non-tithers.","Pastors need to know what's going on in the world and what has been going on for 4,000 years. We need a way to read Scripture which is imaginative, interpretive.","People learn to shop for churches; there is no loyalty to the church. They're consumers being attracted to one product or another. I think it's sacrilege, to tell you the truth, it really is.","There is nothing terribly difficult in the Bible - at least in a technical way. The Bible is written in street language, common language. Most of it was oral and spoken to illiterate people. They were the first ones to receive it. So when we make everything academic, we lose something.","I think pastors are the worst listeners. We're so used to speaking, teaching, giving answers. We must learn to be quiet, quit being so verbal, learn to pay attention to what's going on, and listen.","The Spirit works through community. Somebody will have a stupid, screwy idea. That's okay. The point of having creeds and confessions and traditions is to keep us in touch with the obvious errors."],"Eugene Ionesco":["A work of art is above all an adventure of the mind.","No society has been able to abolish human sadness, no political system can deliver us from the pain of living, from our fear of death, our thirst for the absolute. It is the human condition that directs the social condition, not vice versa.","Ideologies separate us. Dreams and anguish bring us together.","I look out the chair while eating my pillow. I open the wall, I walk with my ears. I have ten eyes to walk with and two fingers to look with. I put my head on the floor to sit down, I put my bottom on the ceiling. After eating the music box, I spread jam on the rug for a great dessert.","Explanation separates us from astonishment, which is the only gateway to the incomprehensible.","Everything that has been will be, everything that will be is, everything that will be has been.","I was born near Bucharest, but my parents came to France a year later. We moved back to Romania when I was thirteen, and my world was shattered. I hated Bucharest, its society, and its mores - its anti-Semitism for example.","Culture cannot be separated from politics. The arts, philosophy and metaphysics, religion and the sciences, constitute culture. Politics are the science or art of organizing our relationships to allow for the development of life in society.","Living is abnormal.","It is not the answer that enlightens, but the question.","A man with a soul is not like every other man.","A nose that can see is worth two that sniff.","We have not the time to take our time.","Cut off from his religious, metaphysical and transcendental roots, man is lost; all his actions become senseless, absurd, useless.","There is no religion in which everyday life is not considered a prison; there is no philosophy or ideology that does not think that we live in alienation.","The critic should describe, and not prescribe.","You can only predict things after they have happened.","Like all revolutions, the surrealist revolution was a reversion, a restitution, an expression of vital and indispensable spiritual needs.","Perhaps I abandoned criticism because I am full of contradictions, and when you write an essay, you are not supposed to contradict yourself. But in the theater, by inventing various characters, you can. My characters are contradictory not only in their language but in their behavior as well.","Woe betide the man who refuses to conform.","Politics separate men by bringing them together only superficially. Art and culture unite us in a common anguish that is our only possible fraternity, that of our existential and metaphysical community.","Often, alas, the most detestable kind of bourgeois is the anti-bourgeois kind of bourgeois.","I've always been suspicious of collective truths.","Beauty is a precious trace that eternity causes to appear to us and that it takes away from us. A manifestation of eternity, and a sign of death as well.","Shakespeare was the great one before us. His place was between God and despair.","A civil servant doesn't make jokes.","When I was nine, the teacher asked us to write a piece about our village fete. He read mine in class. I was encouraged and continued. I even wanted to write my memoirs at the age of ten. At twelve I wrote poetry, mostly about friendship - 'Ode to Friendship.' Then my class wanted to make a film, and one little boy suggested that I write the script.","I have the vanity to think that every play I have written is different from the previous ones. Yet, even though they are written in a different way, they all deal with the same themes, the same preoccupations. 'Exit the King' is also 'The Bald Soprano.'","All theatre is absurd.","My plays have been performed before children, workers, and peasants, and they have well understood the meaning of my theatre. What is needed for people to watch my theatre is a freshness and openness of mind.","The artist can be above political parties, he can belong in a political party, he can act in politics.","Art goes beyond politics. Even if there are writers who are involved in politics, eventually, in one or two centuries, it's not their politics which is going to count, but the fact of having given life to feelings, of having created characters and made a living work of art."],"Eugene Jarecki":["The prison industrial complex, to put it in its crassest term, is a system of industrial mass incarceration. So there's what you call bureaucratic thrust behind it. It's hard to shut off because politicians rely upon the steady flow of jobs to their district that the prison system and its related industries promise.","The prison industrial complex is perhaps, at least domestically, the most striking example of us putting profit before people. It all stems from one basic misunderstanding: that the public good can be shepherded by private interests.","As I was growing up, you know, I'm a white Jewish American born to Holocaust parents. My father fled Nazi Germany in 1939 and my mother's family had fled the czars of Russia before that.","To say that Reagan teaches us that we should be against amnesty for illegal immigrants is to contradict what Reagan himself stood for - that he was in favor of amnesty.","It is only education and understanding of the past that teaches us not to repeat history.","The big lesson of Reagan is: To think that he was some sort of simple figurehead and didn't do the thinking and simply read a script in front of him woefully underestimates him. Ronald Reagan was an extremely intelligent person with a real V8 engine under his hood.","We come out of Jewish-refugee, Holocaust stock, which means that our predecessors fled and we learned that systems of power are vulnerable to corruption and can treat the defenseless in a destructive fashion.","Ronald Reagan, whatever his pros and cons were, was a public servant in the end.","Reaganism as a political movement has enormous resources behind it and it seeks - through stagecraft and through a tremendous level of effort toward propaganda - to present an image of Reagan that is so much larger-than-life that it sort of blinds us all, and keeps us all in a warm, happy, nostalgic state, thinking of a man who can do no wrong.","He presented himself as the friend to Main Street America, and yet that aw-shucks persona ended up packaging policies and programs that were at times deeply injurious to the very people he swore to serve. After all, Reaganomics set in motion one of the largest wealth redistributions in American history, away from the poor and toward the rich.","It was natural to see the struggle for dignity for black people in America as a sister struggle of the Jewish struggle. So growing up, it was always a part of my breakfast cereal to think of myself as someone who was part of a larger struggle.","If we went back to the imprisonment rate we had in the early '70s, something like four out of five people employed in the prison industry would lose their jobs. That's what you're up against.","Ron Reagan amazingly qualifies as an honest broker. I asked him if he was a mama's boy and he said no, more of a papa's boy. At the same time he was willing to say that his father had many shortcomings and needed to be held accountable.","Reagan has very significant things to teach us - positive lessons and quite negative lessons.","It was widespread that the politics of Tea Party people would be foreign to Ronald Reagan and they would be seen by him as frivolous and uninformed.","Reagan is held up to us as an example of never raising taxes. Correction: Reagan raised taxes six of his eight years as president. Why? He was a pragmatist, not doctrinaire. He saw problems emerging, and when his policies faltered he changed his views. Flexibility, not rigidity.","You can call me an Eisenhower Republican. There is a gigantic gulf between an Eisenhower Republican and the kind of fringe brand of Republicanism that is being so vocally promoted today.","Elites are once again invoking Reagan, dropping their G's and saying things in a folksy sort of way that's meant to capture the hearts of people. And it's all fraud; it's all stagecraft. And people are falling for a great deal of elite behavior in this country packaged as if it's proletariat behavior.","Reagan himself, for much of his life, was devoted against the elites. His antagonism to the Soviet Union is antagonism against oppression by the elites of the many.","I mean, like a lot of kids growing up in the early seventies, I was fed Dr. Kissinger with my Fruit Loops. He was the Dr. Ruth of American foreign policy, and the model statesman.","My father left Nazi Germany a year after Dr. Kissinger, and so in my household he was very much an icon. He was a kind of immigrant success story, a refugee success story.","If you watch the evening news, Dr. Kissinger is very often brought on to sort of be the statesman of his age and to reflect dispassionately on world events. And so a film challenging his legacy, a film that assesses charges that are quite grave against him, is something that is touchy for the media to show.","The thing that happens is that politicians run on tough-on-crime rhetoric. You appeal to the public and say, 'Let's put more money into taller fences, tougher laws, tougher sentencing, handcuffs,' and where does that money come from? Well, immediately, it comes out of all the money needed for corrections.","I don't think Reagan is primarily funny, and I don't think he's primarily marvelous; he's complicated.","I have criticisms of Ronald Reagan, but he lives in another universe from the kind of political theater that is represented by people, like Sarah Palin, who aren't really public servants.","The Tea Party is a group that rejects deep thinking, it rejects the very complex analysis that is involved in public policy, it rejects the kind of textured decision-making that Ronald Reagan prided himself on.","Ronald Reagan felt very great regret about the deficits to which he contributed on his watch.","The whole idea of a democracy is that we ourselves, the people, are supposed to make a path of our politics, and it is we who with our feet and our vote and our labors and our vigilance are supposed to shape our country.","Ronald Reagan's legacy is deeply misunderstood because there are political actors in America who, for several reasons, have privately held agendas that they want to sell to the American public in the most appealing way possible. They often find the best way to do that is to package their product with the Reagan brand.","There are people who are trying to advance themselves by wrapping themselves in Reagan.","War is party-blind. It doesn't care who is in the Oval Office. The forces that drive us to war don't care whether it's Republican, Democrat, or other. The fact is, these parties are prey to special interests. That is something Eisenhower was afraid of.","You can't have a discussion about politics without mentioning Ronald Reagan.","Ronald Reagan had many fine qualities and he had many shortcomings. He's not the simple, folksy figure that he's often portrayed as.","His track record of pragmatism, depth and candor all speak to a person who would find the Tea Party simplistic, opportunistic and misguided. Reagan was surrounded by some very smart people who gave him very sound advice. They were not wondering where certain countries are on the map."],"Eugene Jarvis":["To me the arcade experience is the ultimate gaming experience.","Video games are ubiquitous now.","The only legitimate use of a computer is to play games.","I'm an action player. I like to be aggressive. I don't like to be on the run. I like to feel like I have the fates in my hands and that through my skill or lack thereof I control my fate.","I got interested in computers and how they could be enslaved to the megalomaniac impulses of a teenager.","I was originally going to become a biochemist, but it just got way too complicated.","In video you are starting with nothing but a black screen. There's no game there. With pinball you at least start with that basic concept, but not with video. The challenge of going from no game to something today is only different because you have to create something so damn fun people will pay $1.00 every two minutes to play it.","The great times are when you put a game on location and see others play it for the first time. After all, we are really kind of an entertainer. You perform for the joy of the audience."],"Eugene Kennedy":["There would be no need for love if perfection were possible. Love arises from our imperfection, from our being different and always in need of the forgiveness, encouragement and that missing half of ourselves that we are searching for, as the Greek myth tells us, in order to complete ourselves.","If you ask people what attracted them to the person they love, they never tell you of some perfect feature that focused them on sheer surfaces but rather an imperfection that allowed them to see into their uncharted depths.","In April, God speaks to us in the seas whose rhythmic murmuring fills our ears from a long way off. It was in April that the Titanic went down into the deep to lie like a slasher's victim, bleeding the 'debris field' - its passengers' personal possessions, the everyday things of everyman and everywoman - across the ocean's floor.","As in the Divine Right of Kings, hierarchies invest those who preside at the top of their pyramidal structure with absolute power to rule over the lesser ranks that spread down like a marble staircase to the broad foundation stones of those with no power at all.","We may thank God that we can feel pain and know sadness, for these are the human sentiments that constitute our glory as well as our grief.","Human experience resembles the battered moon that tracks us in cycles of light and darkness, of life and death, now seeking out and now stealing away from the sun that gives it light and symbolizes eternity.","The mystery of being human and, certainly, of being a Catholic lies in our embracing together the imperfect state known as the human condition. First and foremost, if we could ever be perfect or do things perfectly, we would eliminate mystery, an essential ingredient in the good life and the spiritual life.","Our human experience, like the World War II Ultra code-breaking machine, catches the heavy traffic of messages about what we really do and what is done to us every day.","Facebook may not only propagate cyber-loneliness but exacerbate the pain of loss that estranged family members feel when they hear only indirectly, through a third-party posting, news of a child or parent with whom they have not spoken in years.","The perception of the horizon is an earthbound event; all horizons disappear in space, and we are left shorn of the sweet roots that have held us to the earth, challenged to imagine what is truly present just before us, a unified and seemingly limitless universe.","The seminary of the future must relate itself to flesh-and-blood men, or it provides a framework that only talks about the people of God but never really shares life with them.","The whole world feels that it knows Francis, not so much because he follows Francis of Assisi but because he is always himself. We have seen him pay his own hotel bill and heard that Francis called Buenos Aires for a pair of ordinary black shoes, like John XXIII, who preferred stout peasant shoes to the traditional papal footwear.","We not only romanticize the future; we have also made it into a growth industry, a parlor game and a disaster movie all at the same time.","Wherever you find 'men together' - writing the rules, as at exclusive golf or other men's clubs, businesses, and lodges where they wear elaborate robes and funny hats - women are kept completely outside if possible and, when grudgingly admitted, to highly restricted areas or token status.","The real test of friendship is: can you literally do nothing with the other person? Can you enjoy those moments of life that are utterly simple?","The priesthood is not dying, but the clerical state is dead. It needs to be buried, preferably with a Viking funeral in Boston Harbor so nobody can miss the spectacle of its passing.","Hierarchical formulations died because their wedding cake levels posited a multiply fractured cosmos that does not match the Space Age revelation of a unified universe in which the earth is clearly in, rather than separated from, the heavens. Hierarchical representations do not reflect what either the world or we are like.","Bishops may often feel but cannot express the sting and throb of submitting themselves to Roman commands because the latter are always presented as tests of their loyalty to the Pope and of their absolute acceptance of his teaching authority, or Magisterium.","As dutiful bishops soon discover, authoritarianism, or control from the top down, characterizes the hierarchical tradition.","The object of religion is the imagination, that deep and inexhaustible font of our understanding and symbolizing our deepest possibilities.","St. Pope John XXIII called for the Second Vatican Council because he understood, as no Holy Father had in a long time, religion spoke to and found its language and symbols - its entire sense of the sacramental nature of existence - in the imagination that reveals not just the penalties of living, but the wonder and awe of our existence.","Most ecclesiastical relics are fixed in time at the moment of their manufacture. That is why they are offered for veneration in casings that resemble pocket watches. They have lost their claim to mystery because they are so clearly the products of time.","From his first hours as pope, Francis has re-enacted or spoken of the great pastoral transformation of Vatican II as his own agenda.","Good priests never look for awards and, perversely enough in the clerical culture universe, do not receive many. Like the aged nuns who taught selflessly and nearly anonymously all their lives, these servants of the People of God only get into the papers when their obituaries are printed.","9/11 revealed that those about to die do not seem afraid or plead for forgiveness for their sins, if they think about them at all. They all have one thing in mind - those they love - and they all do the same thing: They call them up - spouses, family or friends - to tell them they love them.","9/11 allowed us to witness the ordinary face of goodness in the love that those about to die brought with them to work that day. It is fitting that we refer to a large segment of the church year as Ordinary Time because it describes the look of the true faith that, as we read of the Kingdom, is spread about us.","The world, more suffering than sinning, turns toward Pope Francis as in a conversation people turn to the person who is making sense of things.","Pope Francis has aimed a blow at what the whole hierarchical system is built on: a graded system with the higher clergy in the skyboxes, the devoted religious in festival seating, as they say of the crowds at rock concerts, and, on the bottom, the laity in standing room only.","Pope Francis reminds us of Pope John XXIII because both men share the same lack of self-consciousness, and neither needs to keep his guard up through the use of psychological defenses such as rationalization, projection or intellectualization.","Francis seems familiar because Catholics have already known him in the Vatican II priests who have been their pastors and sacramental ministers over the years since that council brought new life to an old church. Catholics have known him in the bishops and priests who brought the spirit of the council to their dioceses and parishes.","Benedict's spending down his energy was a function of his fighting against the Space/Information Age's relentless pressure on the concept of hierarchy, the restoration of which he had, following John Paul II, made a central part of the program that has come to be known as the reform of the reform.","Pope Benedict XVI's resignation is big on buzz but is not the stunning surprise claimed by many pundits. It is rather a further example of the German theology professor's style that informed his years as head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, his term as pope, and the formation of his legacy to the church.","Vatican II and the Space/Information Age began in the same eye blink of history, with John XXIII's opening speech of Vatican II on Oct. 11, 1962, following John F. Kennedy's call for a round trip to the moon a month earlier.","We encounter and enter our richest, most humanly defining experiences by way of a tear in the fabric of things, because we are running late, or because we recognize, across a crowded room, a face whose lack of perfection allows a unique light to shine through and to stir us with uncommon wonder.","Friendship is something whose depth fits human aspirations and fulfills human possibilities. It has heft to it, as a gold-piece does and a gambling chip does not.","Catholicism actually resembles a family that survives because even as it aspires to holiness, it understands and can live with sin and imperfection.","The truth of faith is a slender, glowing element that runs through even the seemingly ordinary and undramatic moments of existence. Even at low intensity, it is a steady source of illumination. Such religious truth is powerful even when it seems faint, even when it seems obscured by the larger events of history."],"Eugene Levy":["I am the common man. I'm polite, I love my family and I play by the rules. And sometimes I get pushed around. That's my lifestyle, and that's what I try to bring to characters.","At the end of the day, even if my part is a bit goofy, the key thing is that I'm doing what I love to do, and that's to make people laugh.","I love comedy. Playing the underdog, and getting the laughs is my form of entertainment. I could think of nothing different that I would want to be doing at this time in my life.","This was more of a cartoonish thing for me and it kind of took me back to SCTV, in a way, where the characters are just a little broader and you can have that kind of fun going a little over the edge.","In ten minutes, I'm thinking, 'OK, you know what? I love these guys. They're really smart, they're really good, they've got a good sense of comedy, under their guidance, I think maybe this could come out OK.' But I didn't like the part.","We went through all the scenes and they became kind of funny and they expanded a little bit and because it seemed to be working so well in the movie, they added a couple of things later on in the movie and that's how it turned out.","The greatest thing about doing this movie was that Chris and I both were involved in folk music in the '60s. I had a group, but I don't think it was at the same level as Chris, because he's an amazing musician.","At the end of the day, the numbers that we're hearing are not going to be totally correct or not correct at all.","I don't believe I've ever played a hip dude. I don't think I would have the wherewithal to do that.","I think I'm the only actor in the history of film who got to slap Sam Jackson on the face and butt and lived to tell about it.","One of the biggest misconceptions about me is that I'm a comedian, which I'm not. A comedian is someone who can stand up in front of an audience and make you laugh. I've never done stand-up and I never will. I'm a comic actor. My comedy comes through my characters.","I can't do comedy that is cutting and vicious. If I knew I'd said something that was going to make someone feel bad, well, that supersedes everything.","I would love to work with Sir Anthony Hopkins. How and why that would happen in a comedy I'm not sure - why he would be dragged over to my side, or I'd be be dragged over to his side.","I really enjoyed working on 'Dumb & Dumberer' with Cheri Oteri, maybe because we are both into improvisations. We were meant to act together.","I like to have a regimen. I don't like to be fancy free.","But I've never really done anything that implies any kind of danger. I wouldn't skydive, I wouldn't deep sea dive, I wouldn't parachute. I think you're really just rolling the dice. Who packed your chute the night before?","I'm not a joke guy; I'm not a stand-up comic."],"Eugene McCarthy":["The only thing that saves us from the bureaucracy is its inefficiency.","Have you ever tried to split sawdust?","The Senate is the last primitive society in the world. We still worship the elders of the tribe and honor the territorial imperative.","No man could be equipped for the presidency if he has never been tempted by one of the seven cardinal sins.","Being in politics is like being a football coach. You have to be smart enough to understand the game, and dumb enough to think it's important.","I can still smell the tear gas in the Hilton Hotel.","It is dangerous for a national candidate to say things that people might remember."],"Eugene Mirman":["I think in Russia, there's a lot of storytelling and anecdotes.","To create a comedy major, I ended up starting a comedy night in the basement of my dorm, and I promoted and produced my final project, which meant I faxed press releases from an old Apple IIC, or whatever it was, to newspapers, not knowing if that would work or if that's how you do things.","Yes, I'm known as America's most genuine comedian.","The truth is, for however much my stories come out of things that have happened to me, they're not darkly or as deeply personal as someone like Marc Maron or a lot of comedians, but they are essentially my life and my interpretation of it.","I went to high school in Lexington, Massachusetts, which in hindsight was very nice.","Comedy clubs were something that came to pass in the '80s, but toward the end of that, in the early '90s, people started doing comedy again in alternative spaces."],"Eugene O'Neill":["Obsessed by a fairy tale, we spend our lives searching for a magic door and a lost kingdom of peace.","Life is a solitary cell whose walls are mirrors.","When you're 50 you start thinking about things you haven't thought about before.

I have it with everything.","I don't think any evil character thinks that they are evil - they think they have insight that people don't.","I'd be lying to you if I said at 8 I went up to my parents and said, 'Listen, I'm going to become an actor.' That was not the case.","The only way you learn is by doing. You learn through deed, so that's kind of my aspiration for the time being.","The smells are very strong on 'Game of Thrones': the incense, the fire, the heat of all the burns. The smell of Lancel's Faith Militant cloth is very thick in my nostrils right now. And I think the warmth of it all: the hard work ethics, the ambiance, the temperature of the set. There are so many sensory memories of it, which will never leave me.","I've always been fond of my heritage, particularly my Irish heritage. But I'm also from all over the world.","The first thing I said if I sat on the Iron Throne would probably be, 'Ouch!' It's actually painful because it's made of swords. But my first Royal Edict would be, 'Somebody get rid of this damn chair!'","I am interested in complex characters who are difficult and have numerous sides. But I would love to do a comedy role - something maybe 'Monty Python'-esque.","I am a strange creature. I want to challenge myself and keep people guessing with the roles I take.","I am obsessed with the idea of transformation. I have been very lucky so far to play very different roles - and I would love for that to continue.","I am very keen to take on a 'West End' show soon, as I haven't done much theatre, and that would be amazing.

And then eventually you'll get there.","I love going to the beach and swimming in the ocean. I think it's so relaxing. It's also a great form of active recovery. It's perfect for those rest days when you still want to move a little bit.","I'm very hard on myself. Sometimes too hard on myself. When I lost in the Wimbledon finals, I was so sad, I cried. I had the runner-up trophy! It's still a great accomplishment, but I was so mad.","If you're playing someone you care about, it's tough, and I don't want to be in that situation. We are playing big matches for big points and prize money, and I take it very seriously. I relax when I'm outside tennis.","Even the greatest player of all times loses sets or is down in a match. It just shows that, you know, a win is never guaranteed. It shows all of us that we have to work for every point, fight for every point no matter what.","I did not have a normal life. I'd be training when my sister would be at birthday parties and sleepovers. I finished high school by correspondence, basically working two full-time jobs. The last years were very, very tough. But I was willing to do that. It's all about sacrifice.","I have very vivid dreams, and often - this happens to me at least a few times a week - I don't know if something happened in real life or in a dream. I'm like, 'Mom, did this neighbor come over, or was it a dream?' And she's like, 'No, what are you talking about?'","I don't really think dreams have real meaning. Some people believe in that. I just think it's your brain, after a day of crazy random pieces of information jumbled together, creating interesting stories. I just view it as entertainment.","After they lose, I think all tennis players go back to a specific part of the match where they wish they had done something different.","Maria Sharapova winning Wimbledon at 17, I don't think that's ever going to happen again. It's a different game now. I need to stay focused and work on my game, and it will come.","I won't play past 30. Why?

It's a treat to travel without your racket bag.","Even when I was much younger, whatever I did, I wanted to do it to the best of my abilities. When I came home from school, I would be the one doing my homework while my siblings would be watching TV and putting it off until later.","I've never really focused on my ranking per se because it's out of my control. I try and do the right thing each week, and the ranking will look after itself.","Even sleep is part of my job because I need a certain number of hours of sleep to be able to train at the intensity that I do. I'm constantly working to keep my body in the best possible shape.","I'm not a cooking person, so there's not much in the fridge. On the rare occasion that I do cook, I make myself breakfast. Eggs are my go-to in the morning for some protein. Orange juice as well. You have to start your day off with that.","Someone that I'm really inspired by, and that I look up to, is Oprah. It's amazing how she created such an empire.","I see it as a compliment to be compared to someone like Sharapova who has won five Slams. She's a great champion. I see it in a positive light.

You don't have to do anything. The chances of that shark attacking you in any way is so remote. The sea should be enjoyed, the animals in it. When you see a shark underwater, you should say, 'How lucky I am to see this beautiful animal in his environment!'","I knew more about produce from the sea than any of my schoolmates, and my reports in school, from kindergarten on, amused and shocked my classmates and teachers. I told them how we ate with chopsticks, had rice and seaweed for breakfast, raw fish, octopus, and sea urchin eggs for supper, and cakes made from sharks.","I don't work at something because I think it's important. I work at things that, to me, are interesting.","I want to be remembered as a nice person who didn't hurt people - except my ex-husbands, maybe.","I can't think of anything I regret. Everything I've done, I've enjoyed doing. I've had five husbands, four children. I've done it all, but mainly I've enjoyed studying fish and being underwater with them, being in their natural habitat, looking at the fish and the fish looking at me.","Sharks are among the most perfectly constructed creatures in nature. Some forms have survived for two hundred million years.","People generally thought that sharks are dumb eating machines. After some study, I began to realize that these 'gangsters' of the deep had gotten a bad rap.","As a child, William Beebe was my hero, and I used to read about him going down in the bathysphere, and I wanted to do that too.

They love seeing their own people; they want to see themselves onscreen. In my case, I know them pretty well. I know what they laugh at. I think it's going to open a lot of doors, this movie.","Pantelion and Televisa can reach my core fan base better than anyone, and with the distribution expertise and brand recognition of Lionsgate, I know we can build on the crossover audience that we began to reach with 'Instructions.'"],"Eugenio Montale":["I have always knocked at the door of that wonderful and terrible enigma which is life.","Happiness, for you we walk on a knife edge. To the eyes you are a flickering light, to the feet, thin ice that cracks; and so may no one touch you who loves you.","I am perhaps a late follower of Zoroaster and I believe that the foundation of life is built upon the struggle between the two opposing forces of Good and Evil.","Man cannot produce a single work without the assistance of the slow, assiduous, corrosive worm of thought.","Against the dark background of this contemporary civilization of well-being, even the arts tend to mingle, to lose their identity.","Evidently the arts, all the visual arts, are becoming more democratic in the worst sense of the word.","Today not even a universal fire could make the torrential poetic production of our time disappear. But it is exactly a question of production, that is, of hand-made products which are subject to the laws of taste and fashion.","However, poetry does not live solely in books or in school anthologies.","I do not go in search of poetry. I wait for poetry to visit me.","I have been judged to be a pessimist but what abyss of ignorance and low egoism is not hidden in one who thinks that Man is the god of himself and that his future can only be triumphant?","It has often been observed that the repercussion of poetic language on prose language can be considered a decisive cut of a whip.","Narrative art, the novel, from Murasaki to Proust, has produced great works of poetry.","Poetry is the art which is technically within the grasp of everyone: a piece of paper and a pencil and one is ready.","Slowly poetry becomes visual because it paints images, but it is also musical: it unites two arts into one.","The poet does not know - often he will never know - whom he really writes for.","There is poetry even in prose, in all the great prose which is not merely utilitarian or didactic: there exist poets who write in prose or at least in more or less apparent prose; millions of poets write verses which have no connection with poetry.","True poetry is similar to certain pictures whose owner is unknown and which only a few initiated people know.","Too many lives are needed to make just one.","Art is the production of objects for consumption, to be used and discarded while waiting for a new world in which man will have succeeded in freeing himself of everything, even of his own consciousness.","But poets were not considered dangerous and they were advised to exercise self-censorship. At most, poets were requested not to write at all. I took advantage of this negative liberty.","For my part, if I consider poetry as an object, I maintain that it is born of the necessity of adding a vocal sound (speech) to the hammering of the first tribal music.","In reality art is always for everyone and for no one.","Many of today's verses are prose and bad prose.","Mass communication, radio, and especially television, have attempted, not without success, to annihilate every possibility of solitude and reflection.","Strangely, Dante's Divine Comedy did not produce a prose of that creative height or it did so after centuries.","There is also poetry written to be shouted in a square in front of an enthusiastic crowd. This occurs especially in countries where authoritarian regimes are in power.","This proves that great lyric poetry can die, be reborn, die again, but will always remain one of the most outstanding creations of the human soul."],"Eula Biss":["As for mercury, a child will almost certainly get more mercury exposure from her immediate environment than from vaccination. This is true, too, of the aluminum that is often used as an adjuvant in vaccines to intensify the immune response.","A vaccine introduces a small amount or a tempered version of the virus into the body - just enough to that the body is able to recognize it and deal with it when it encounters it again in the future.","Fears that formaldehyde from vaccines may cause cancer are similar to fears of mercury and aluminum, in that they coalesce around miniscule amounts of the substance in question, amounts considerably smaller than amounts from other common sources of exposure to the same substance.","Imagine the action of a vaccine not just in terms of how it affects a single body, but also in terms of how it affects the collective body of a community.","Some of the most interesting research that I did was about risk assessment and how ordinary citizens like me handle risk assessment and how irregular our risk assessments are.","We've been using vaccination in some form for hundreds of years now. We have almost nothing in our modern medicine that we've been using that long, and it's been consistently productive even though, you know, the older vaccines were much more dangerous than vaccines we're using now.","In the story of Thetis and Achilles, it's clear this isn't really a safe environment. She's gone down to the River Styx - the dead are being ferried across in the background. There's something in this mythology that says that if you want invulnerability, if you want immortality, you pay a price.","On the pro-vaccine side - and not everyone does this, but I saw it enough for it to make me really uncomfortable - is a tendency to accuse people who are wary of vaccination of being stupid and not understanding science.","Art-making was part of my daily life from a very young age, and I still love that kind of everyday art-making.","Yes, there's a higher rate of people living below the poverty line who aren't vaccinated. But it's much rarer for that to be a product of choice than a product of circumstance.","My mother wrote poetry when I was young - I have an early memory of the sound of her typewriter - and my father told me inventive bedtime stories.","What I saw when I was doing research is that in pursuit of a middle ground, people will kind of split the difference between the two extremes that they're hearing. And I think what's problematic is that people are seeing vaccinating on schedule, on time, as an extreme position.","I think that protecting children at the age where they're most vulnerable against diseases that are highly contagious is prudent.","I think that people's resistance to vaccination isn't going to disappear until we address some of the nonmedical reasons for that resistance and people's discomfort and distrust of the government. That's bigger than what most medical professionals can handle.","Nigeria and Pakistan are two countries that have had a lot of trouble with polio. And part of the reason is that there's a lot of political unrest, and people really distrust what the government is doing. That has an effect on people's health, and it has an effect on the health of children.","I talked to lots of people who are vaccine-hesitant, and I actually was one myself until I got further into this project, and most of them actually are in my demographic: so well-educated people with advanced degrees who are upper middle-class and have read quite a bit on the subject.","Herd immunity is, it turns out, not incredibly easy to understand. It took me quite a bit of reading before I fully grasped it. But understanding herd immunity is essential to understanding why we vaccinate the way we do.","There's this tendency to think of the individual and the collective are somehow at odds or separate. But I think that's really false. We're all both. And when the individual suffers, the collective suffers, and vice versa.","There's a cultural expectation that everyone will be immunized, in part to protect the entire population. When people refuse that expectation, they're indulging in a certain kind of political or social immunity.","In some areas, immunity has been eroded so much that the child who's not vaccinated is now actually more vulnerable to the complications of infectious diseases.","In the case of Pakistan, the CIA actually used a fake vaccination campaign to try to locate Osama bin Laden, so now vaccination is associated with espionage.","One of the shortcomings of our medical system is that doctors have very little time with their patients.","I think there's a temptation to try to think of people who don't vaccinate as a homogenous community, but I'm not convinced that's true. I'm not even sure that the word 'community' is totally accurate there, you know.","If your child's going to ride in a car or go swimming or play soccer, all of those things involve risk. And if your child doesn't do any of those things, then they're probably sitting too much, and that involves risk, too.","I had already drafted the manuscript that would become my first book by the time I graduated from college, but I had no idea what to do with it.","I guess I could say that I pursue questions that interest me in ways that interest me on the page, but that's awfully vague.","Bram Stoker's 'Dracula,' in my reading, is really obviously about disease and our relation to disease.","Our community of contagion really is a world community.","There's a lot of essay writing that could pass for journalism and journalism that could pass for essay. Some of it is just taxonomy.","Our constitution got built around the idea of minority protection.","When I was researching the Victorian anti-vaccination movement, those activists often used a vampire as a metaphor for the vaccinator.","The risk of getting Hep B from a blood transfusion is a tiny number, but it's a bigger number than the risk of side effects from the vaccine.","There's something ancient and inevitable about this desire to do whatever you can to protect your child.","Yes, we can make prudent choices as parents, but we can't create an environment where there's zero risk for our children. Not only is that impossible, I don't think it's desirable, either.","In the 19th century, smallpox was widely considered a disease of filth, which meant that it was largely understood to be a disease of the poor. According to filth theory, any number of contagious diseases were caused by bad air that had been made foul by excrement or rot.","Most of us believe that dirt is good for our kids, but some of us are wary of the grass in the parks, which may or may not have been treated with toxic chemicals.","My son is fully vaccinated, but there is one immunization on the standard schedule that he did not receive on time. This was meant to be his very first shot, the hep B administered to most babies immediately after birth.","The belief that public health measures are not intended for people like us is widely held by many people like me. Public health, we assume, is for people with less - less education, less-healthy habits, less access to quality health care, less time and money.","Babies born to women who are infected with hep B - and mothers can carry the virus without their knowledge - will almost certainly be infected if they are not vaccinated within twelve hours of birth.","One of the mysteries of hep B immunization is that vaccinating only 'high risk' groups, which was the original public health strategy, did not bring down rates of infection.","My own thinking is often clarified and extended by talking with students."],"Euny Hong":["Assimilation, not success, is the American end game.","Can you think of a single situation, no matter how grave, where the atmosphere would not be instantly shattered with a loud fart - or a drawing of a butt? There is no faster way to create universal common ground.","Bad things happen when you try to let things just happen. You can't be passive.","First, one scrambles for wealth. Then, one luxuriates in mocking the effeteness that comes with it.","As I found again and again as a writer, when you're completely honest about something, people respond to that.","I'll come out and say it because no one else will: French gross-out humor is the best. Particularly the illustrated variety.","You can call double-eyelid surgery wrong or see it as evidence of body dysmorphia, but don't overplay the race issue. It's insulting to those of us who are merely vain.","I think we've gotten to a point where we're becoming really sensitive to things like body dysmorphia, but I think it's gone too far, where people are accusing everyone of hating themselves.","It's a classic error in American discourse: the conflation of race with culture.","It was not a secret, then or now, that there is something vaguely un-American about forcing your child to be really good at classical music performance.","As the saying goes, even a broken clock is right twice a day; that doesn't mean you should run out and buy one."],"Euripides":["Friends show their love in times of trouble, not in happiness.","To a father growing old nothing is dearer than a daughter.","One loyal friend is worth ten thousand relatives.","Silence is true wisdom's best reply.","Talk sense to a fool and he calls you foolish.","Down on your knees, and thank heaven, fasting, for a good man's love.","Danger gleams like sunshine to a brave man's eyes.","Youth is the best time to be rich, and the best time to be poor.","Do not plan for ventures before finishing what's at hand.","The greatest pleasure of life is love.","Ten soldiers wisely led will beat a hundred without a head.","When a man's stomach is full it makes no difference whether he is rich or poor.","Life has no blessing like a prudent friend.","Love is all we have, the only way that each can help the other.","Human misery must somewhere have a stop; there is no wind that always blows a storm.","Much effort, much prosperity.","Lucky that man whose children make his happiness in life and not his grief, the anguished disappointment of his hopes.","Among mortals second thoughts are wisest.","There is just one life for each of us: our own.","To persevere, trusting in what hopes he has, is courage in a man.","Silver and gold are not the only coin; virtue too passes current all over the world.","Question everything. Learn something. Answer nothing.","Love makes the time pass. Time makes love pass.","There is the sky, which is all men's together.","The good and the wise lead quiet lives.","He is not a lover who does not love forever.","No one can confidently say that he will still be living tomorrow.","Nothing has more strength than dire necessity.","It's not beauty but fine qualities, my girl, that keep a husband.","In misfortune, which friend remains a friend?","This is slavery, not to speak one's thought.","He was a wise man who originated the idea of God.","Forgive, son; men are men; they needs must err.","Prosperity is full of friends.","Whoso neglects learning in his youth, loses the past and is dead for the future.","The lucky person passes for a genius.","One does nothing who tries to console a despondent person with word. A friend is one who aids with deeds at a critical time when deeds are called for.","Better a serpent than a stepmother!","Wealth stays with us a little moment if at all: only our characters are steadfast, not our gold.","The bold are helpless without cleverness.","Happiness is brief. It will not stay. God batters at its sails.","Those whom God wishes to destroy, he first makes mad.","Events will take their course, it is no good of being angry at them; he is happiest who wisely turns them to the best account.","Impudence is the worst of all human diseases.","Leave no stone unturned.","Fortune truly helps those who are of good judgment.","The best of seers is he who guesses well.","Authority is never without hate.","Ignorance of one's misfortunes is clear gain.","Cleverness is not wisdom.","No one who lives in error is free.","No one is happy all his life long.","Some wisdom you must learn from one who's wise.","Luckier than one's neighbor, but still not happy.","Slight not what's near through aiming at what's far.","There is something in the pang of change More than the heart can bear, Unhappiness remembering happiness.","No one is truly free, they are a slave to wealth, fortune, the law, or other people restraining them from acting according to their will.","The best and safest thing is to keep a balance in your life, acknowledge the great powers around us and in us. If you can do that, and live that way, you are really a wise man.","Chance fights ever on the side of the prudent.","I would prefer as friend a good man ignorant than one more clever who is evil too.","Do not consider painful what is good for you.","Joint undertakings stand a better chance when they benefit both sides.","The wavering mind is but a base possession.","'Twas but my tongue, 'twas not my soul that swore.","Along with success comes a reputation for wisdom.","New faces have more authority than accustomed ones.","God hates violence.

But opportunities, boy oh boy, they exist.","Africa is the second-largest continent, a landmass second from Asia. It also is the second most populated continent, with 900 million people. In fact - coming back to the land mass - Africa is so big that you could fit in the continental United States, China, and the entire Europe into Africa and still have space.","Global capital is agnostic - it has no loyalties. There's an overhang of capital in the U.S., and the key is yield pickup. What Africa is providing is a diversification play and also opportunities for yield pickup for the investor that's aware of what he or she is doing."],"Euzhan Palcy":["I wanted to make a black story about South Africa. Unfortunately, no producer in the United States would put one penny into a black story.","I believe that the American audience is not so dumb that they wouldn't be interested in a black story.","Some people make movies for money or glory and will take any subject people offer them. But I cannot do that. I need to feel the story and make it mine.","As a child, I always wanted to be the last one to take a bath because I knew I could close the door and spend hours just having my bath and singing.","In the days when I wasn't being taken seriously, I wore long skirts - very conservative. But now, I dress any way I want to.","When my mother and father fell in love, my mother's family would never accept it.","When I started out, there were three things that made film people look at me with condescension, I was young, I was black, and I was female. I have won a certain respect, but I think the film community still sees directing as a male job.","Francois Truffaut was my godfather on 'Sugar Cane Alley.' He believed in me and in that story, and told everyone that it should be made.","My experience I consider an accident in the Hollywood system. I don't believe it should be a reference for a black film maker, or an example for any young film maker, because it's purely luck.","I've been to Cuba many times.","There are many projects I couldn't get off the ground because they didn't have white heroes. It's a problem that everyone who's been working in Hollywood has been facing.","'Sugar Cane Alley' had a lot of international success, big success everywhere.","When African-Americans come to France, the French show them more consideration than they would show an African or a Black Caribbean. When African-Americans come to France, the French people are like, 'Oh, wow. Oh my God.' But if it's an African, they're like, 'Whatever.' It's all because of the past, because of our history.","My grandmother always used to tell me, if I had a problem, I was only allowed to complain for one second. Then I had to take action."],"Eva Amurri":["A good teacher who can take the zero pay and help kids develop physically, emotionally, socially, is literally an angel.","Honestly, I don't know if I'd want to be an educator. I find teachers to have more responsibility, in a way, than being a parent. You're molding hundreds of minds every year.","The great thing about acting is that you get to be a lot of different things in one lifetime. You get to explore different personalities and characters.","If an actor is bored, then they are boring to an audience. I definitely don't want to ever be that.","I actually wanted to be an astronaut, but I don't have a mathematical brain.","My parents have always said, 'You'll be so unhappy if you're no more than your career, that it's important to get out there and do things other than just your career.'"],"Eva Braun":["When he says he loves me, it only means he loves me at that particular instant. Like his promises, which he never keeps. Why does he torment me like this, when he could finish it off at once?","He has so often told me he is madly in love with me, but what does that mean when I haven't had a good word from him in three months?","I have now reached the happy age of 23. No, happy is not quite the right word. At this particular moment I am certainly not happy.","I am racking my brains to find out why he left without saying goodby to me.","God, I am afraid he won't give me his answer today. If only somebody would help me - it is all so terribly depressing.","Why doesn't that Devil take me with him? It would be much better with him than it is here.","Today I bought two lottery tickets, because I had a feeling that it would be now or never - they were both blanks. So I am not going to be rich after all. Nothing at all to be done about it.","I am so infinitely happy that he loves me so much, and I pray that it will always be like this. It won't be my fault if he ever stops loving me.","Perhaps he wanted to be alone with Dr. G., who was here, but he should have let me know. At Hoffmann's I felt I was sitting on hot coals, expecting him to arrive every moment.","There is only one thing I want. I would like to be seriously ill, and to hear nothing more about him for at least a week. Why doesn't something happen to me? Why do I have to go through all this? If only I had never set eyes on him!","I sat with him for three hours and we did not exchange a single word. At the end he handed me, as he had done before, an envelope with money in it. It would have been much nicer if he had enclosed a greeting or a loving word. I would have been so pleased if he had."],"Eva Chen":["Build a lifestyle around your brand, and the audience will follow.","A good attitude is really important. And a sense of optimism, someone who has ideas and isn't afraid to pitch them no matter what level she is. Someone who is proactive. Someone with efficiency and common sense. They don't always go hand-in-hand, common sense and, well, everything else.","My advice for young people is, study what you love and intern in what you want to do. And I think it's okay to pivot as many times as you need to.","I have a bag and shoe addiction. If I were a doctor or a lawyer, I'd still have it.","I would say I am unapologetically nerdy. I was always a little awkward.","Beauty is the lowest common denominator: I don't care what they say - every girl, every woman, wants to feel pretty and empowered and beautiful, within their own definition of beautiful. I love fashion, I love shopping, but I love beauty more because I love the science of it.","Basically, I feel like people have always taken photos of themselves. When I was in college, I had these Polaroid cameras my friends and I would have so much fun with. Today, we'd be taking those pictures on our phones. I think it's just part of culture today... Why not have fun with it?","You can get inspired from a magazine, yes, but you can also be inspired from a website, from a street-style blogger, from what people post on Instagram.","The thing about Instagram and fashion is that is has absolutely taken down the sense of the velvet rope and has pulled the curtain aside on the entire experience that used to be for a select 100 people in the world. Now it is there for millions of people to consume.","I know how I shop and how I am inspired to buy things, and the majority of it is from Instagram. I look at people like Yasmin Sewell and Leandra Medine from the Man Repeller, as well as the countless models that have really cool street style, for inspiration all the time.","If you had asked me growing up what a stylist does or what a magazine editor does, I would have had no clue - how do you research something like that when you are a first-born child of an immigrant who only grew up knowing doctor, engineer, and lawyer as careers?","There are different ways to show and tell through Instagram. What's right for one designer will be very different for another designer, and everyone's going to be figuring things out, but it's a great opportunity to use it for feedback.","To say I like social media is an understatement.","We're a show-and-tell generation. People want to see behind the scenes. The more involved and invited they are, the closer affinity they have to your brand.","The new generation of designers, like Prabal Gurung and Alexander Wang, have hundreds of thousands following them on social media who will probably never be able to afford their dresses but still feel a loyalty to them. So when that designer writes a book or launches a beauty line, they might pick that up.","Fashion appeals to everyone... Everyone gets into it.","The eight months I took off between 'Teen Vogue' and 'Lucky' afforded me such amazing opportunities, and I learned so much from so many different people - the brands that I worked with, the companies that I was consulting for.","This is so cliche and cheesy but so true - seeing how happy people get if you A. give them a beauty product or B. give them a tip that works. There's such joy in finding a good beauty product.","The best perk of my job is getting to take products home. I mean, my bathroom looks like Sephora; like a clean, smaller Sephora.","I've been trying out all these bronzers, and By Terry has an amazing one called the Bronze Expert.","There are a lot of people on Instagram desperately trying to keep up with the Joneses.","You could be an 18-year-old girl in Tokyo wondering how you could ever break into fashion or beauty, so you follow your favourite designer or editor, see what their day comprises, where they go, who they meet, how they do it... If I were setting up my own label today, I would definitely do it through Instagram.","My job is more about helping people tell their stories in ever more interesting ways.","Instagram was initially launched as a community for artists and photographers.","You do not need to go to journalism school if you want to work in the fashion industry. I think high schools condition you to think this way: If you want to be a fashion editor, go to fashion school. If you want to be a writer, you should study journalism. I think that the best school in life is experience.","Print is very important because I think there is nothing like the tactile sense of picking up a magazine.","Think about what you like and then think about why - was it the shape? The hem length? And then repeat over and over until you find your signature style. And if you ever get sick of your signature style... change it! That's the beauty of fashion.","Instagram is the perfect place to reach your audience because the playing field is leveled if you can create engaging/amazing/compelling content that people want to follow. Remember that there's more than just showing product. Show the woman who designed it. Write about your muses.","It's more instructive to learn what you don't like than just to like everything.","I was very focused on school. No social life whatsoever.","Working at 'Harper's' was an awakening experience for me. I genuinely enjoyed the process of putting together a fashion magazine.","When my alarm goes off between 6 to 6:30 A.M, the first thing I do is reach for my phone. I look at Twitter to see the headlines. It's become my news aggregator. Then I check my Instagram.","My work life is pretty much the opposite of what you would expect.","For a lot of children of immigrants, what happens is your parents want you to do something very linear that they can understand. I had an aptitude in sciences and never really questioned it.","I bought my first pair of pointy-toed Miu Miu shoes with a kitten heel from Barneys. They were $200, and it was a big deal. I wore them with a pleated black Benetton skirt and a white shirt. I looked like a waitress.","There's a curiosity about what magazine editors do, the behind-the-curtain experience.","I use pure acetone Nail Polish Remover from Nails Inc. to really strip the nail. It's actually important to dehydrate your nail a little bit to get rid of all of the oil before you put color on; then the color will really stick. Then, I use OPI Bond Aid. It's a liquid dehydrator that you paint onto each nail.","I finish off my manicure with Dior's Gel Coat, which has a thicker consistency than most top coats. It dries quickly and leaves your nails really shiny.","During Fashion Week, I tend to do a gel manicure because it's easier.","When I use a polish, I end up changing my nail color 2.5 times a week. The '.5' is when I get them done and notice it's not perfect - I'll fix it myself."],"Eva Figes":["It is a hidden fear that somehow, if they are only given a chance, women will suddenly do as they have been done by.","The much vaunted male logic isn't logical, because they display prejudices against half the human race that are considered prejudices according to any dictionary definition."],"Eva Gabor":["If a man is truly in love, the most beautiful woman in the world couldn't take him away. Maybe for a few days, but not forever.","Love is a game that two can play and both win.","I love the fast lane.","I was the first actress in the family, and I am still the only actress in the family. I shouldn't be saying it, but it slipped out!","Marriage is too interesting an experiment to be tried only once.","There was no way I could live in Hollywood and not become an actress.","My co-workers expect me to be late and temperamental.","Most people don't need to work as hard as I do.","It's sheer torture. I have to be up with the chickens every day and go to work on my body. I hate it, but I do it.","The only thing you have to know are your words.","The average housewife goes to the restaurant to relax and enjoy the food. But when Eva walks in, she becomes the center of attention.","I've always known I would be a success, but I was surprised at the way it came.","I'm acting when I serve as a hostess, when I run my wig business. I was born to act, and life itself is the greatest part.","I'm a workaholic. Before long I'm traveling on my nervous energy alone. This is incredibly exhausting.","I should have been smart enough to stay happy. But my ambition ruled my life.","I made up my mind to be an actress when I was 4 years old.","I learned early that you only have so much energy to give. You have to spend it correctly.","East Hampton happens to have been the first place in the world where I was a star, a real star with a star pasted above my name on the dressing-room door.","After all the work I've done, why should I suddenly be treated as a bona fide actress?"],"Eva Gabrielsson":["I'm not violent, I don't believe in killing people, but standing up for yourself, speaking out against injustice, is another form of vengeance.","Marriage is not common in Sweden.","Maybe people become bitter when they don't know what they are fighting for. But I keep my eyes open."],"Eva Green":["I am a dreamer. Seriously, I'm living on another planet.","Life's too short to wear high heels.","I was born in Paris, and it's a beautiful place, but London feels like home. I like the village feeling, I like running in the parks - even the food isn't as bad as it used to be.","I don't like flirting, and when I love someone, I always give everything, maybe too much. And then you have to work at it all the time. I mean, the first months are always great, but afterwards it becomes hard work. It's not as passionate and crazy.","I would love to play an unexpected character. Really raw and simple and not a cliche - something rugged. People like to put actors in boxes.","I want to travel. Maybe I'll end up living in Norway, making cakes.","I think it's very important to recognize talent in all facets of filmmaking. Making a movie is such a lengthy and intense experience, so it's wonderful to honour actors, directors, producers and all crew members who put so much hard work and passion into a project.","When I'm not working, I just like to be comfortable: I love black, nothing tight, no heels, no make-up - it's nice to be able to breathe!","The worst is when men try too hard, because it's not very masculine. Your outfit has to look like 'Oh, I just grabbed that.' Not too calculated. Jeans, a t-shirt: the simpler the better.","I have my own style and don't really follow fashion, but I like leggings. They're easy to wear and can go with anything.","Some people collect butterflies - I love beetles.","Towards the end of 'Dark Shadows,' the sets are cracking and bleeding, but so is Angelique. The fact that she breaks apart physically as well as mentally lends an added dimension, and I just loved playing that.","I like style. For Dior, I did more of a collaboration shoot, not just a single image - so there was more to it. It's a very prestigious brand. I like their style and feel like their style is mine.","People think I'm so strong, but I'm very shy.","I didn't want to do 'Casino Royale' when they told me to audition. I said no. Then they sent me the script, and I thought it was actually very interesting - and I had no other work at the time.","Lots of shy people dress a bit too much. It's just kind of an armour. People say the same thing about me.","Oh, yeah, I like a high neck. And I like naked backs. It seems very sexy. Red carpets are about being a bit theatrical - having fun rather than being too safe. You have to be brave. Fashion is fun.","I feel like I'm 1,000. I don't feel I'm young enough a lot of the time.","I'm not really keen on men wearing perfumes. It's just a bit wrong! I don't find it sexy. I prefer essential oils - patchouli is nice.","It's true that I'm drawn to unusual stories. Normal roles don't really attract me.","I give everything to my work, and I like complex roles, characters that aren't obvious. I've been very lucky so far, and I'm dreaming of working with directors like Jane Campion, Susanne Bier and the Dardennes. But the gods will decide.","I always start the day with a cup of hot water and lemon - I find it really cleanses and hydrates me. I have very sensitive, dry skin, so I have to be careful about what I put on my face. My must-haves are Dermalogica cleansing gel and L'Or De Vie Creme Riche by Dior, which is thick and nourishing.","I don't wear base, as I don't like to cover up my freckles, but I couldn't live without YSL Touche Eclat for hiding my under-eye circles. I love the smoky-eye look, so I use Dior's 5-Colour Eyeshadow in Night Dust and lashings of mascara. I finish with a dash of bronzer for a healthy glow.","Hmm, limelight... No, I'm not Sienna Miller or Angelina Jolie. I'm very lucky and happy, but I still find it very difficult to get good scripts and good roles. It's really a jungle out there.","We all show facets, to your mother, or to your boyfriend, or a friend. You're always a bit different.","I'm not really involved with politics... I'm living in my cocoon with my classical music around.","I'm worried because of my mother, she's going to see my performance and she's quite hard. She's going to see me naked. And my Dad, woah. Yeah, they're going to see me like a woman, you know?","Everyone wants to work in America. Maybe not blockbusters or Terminator, but to have the choice.","My mother did movies from the New Wave, but I was quite shocked I didn't know much about that period. Bernado showed us film of the demonstrations of the time.","My father is Swedish and my mother is French.","Success is very ephemeral. You depend entirely on the desire of others, which makes it difficult to relax.","I'll need my whole lifetime to polish my craft.","I'm French, so I'm quite lazy about exercising, and I smoke. But I do love going for a run in the morning with my dog. That's all.","A lot of the films now are more focused on the visuals than on the actors. I think all directors should go to drama school.","I hardly ever go to parties. If I really have to, I'll go, but I'm not the most open person, which is sometimes not the best quality.","I also liked Daniel Craig. He's not like any other Bond. So we'll see. In 10 years I might be cursed for doing it, but I'm very grateful for what it has done for me.","When people say 'You're so beautiful' it makes me want to kill myself! As an actress you want to be seen for what you do, for the characters you can play, otherwise I'd be a model.","I feel sick if I have to do something for the money. I can't breathe. I'm not proud of myself.","I need to fall in love with someone. Sorry - I mean fall in love with something. I need to wake myself up.","I was very studious, too much. I would never go out at weekends. I was very serious. You should have seen me in class - I was blushing and sweating every time the teacher asked me something.","In this business actors who have Botox or surgery make you very aware of age. It's awful.","In Los Angeles, I feel like the ugly duckling, like I'm from Venus or something.","Most of the women in film are there to be beautiful to the man.","It's quite hard to find a ballsy or complex character. So the roles I've taken are those. Lot's of people put me in the dark category.","There's this shop in New York I go to; it has bones and fossils and insects that are like works of art. I have a few on my wall.","I like characters who have strong facades and then have secrets. They have cracks.","I go shopping maybe three times a year in an intense way. I'm like a man. Can't spend too much time in a shop.","I wear no makeup in real life. I'm very simple. That may be why I go over the top for the red carpet. But otherwise, I'm very plain. I should make more of an effort, actually.","I love the musicality of English. French sounds flat. In English, you can play with pitch.","For me, working out is nothing to do with looks. It's to let it all out - the stress, the self-consciousness - you think less; it makes you more centred.","A film can be big or small - I have to just fall in love with it. To connect with the character, the script, and the director. Sometimes they say to you, 'You should do that for your career; it's a big thing, people will go and see it,' but I wouldn't be able to, because my heart wouldn't be in it. I would drive people quite mad.","For Tim Burton's birthday I gave him a rainbow beetle. He loved it!","I'm not into social media. I'm like from another century.","Hollywood wouldn't suit me. In L.A. it's all about work - studio people have their five minutes with you and they go, 'Oh mah Gahd, I love your movie.' You just feel very self-conscious there.","When I'm at an event, I like to be an eccentric dresser. I will just keep wearing what I like.","I love Ireland. I feel very at peace there. It's just magical and beautiful.","I play the piano. I bought an upright piano that is actually electric, so I can practice my scales with headphones on and not make my neighbours' lives hell!","I hope I will not be typecast as a Bond girl for the rest of my life. I'm very proud of being a part of the Bond family, but I don't want to be the sexy girl forever. I'm not meaning to complain, but I just want to be taken seriously.","My mother is an actress and very well known in France; hence, I move to London to start my own life.","My father has always written with Mont Blanc pens. It's very chic and elegant and classic.","I'm very scared of water. When you don't see the water... I imagine monsters - stupid things.","Actually, when I'm not filming a movie, my beauty approach is really natural - I prefer a bare face that looks really healthy and dewy.","I'm very low-maintenance when it comes to my beauty routine.","It's very flattering to be remembered as a Bond girl with brains and not just for looking good in a bikini. I was a fan of Sophie Marceau in 'The World Is Not Enough.' I think her performance was very underrated.","I'm a dark blonde, yes. I dyed my hair blue, then black, when I was 14. I thought the colour was more flattering and matched my skin tone. I don't think I'd ever change back unless it was for a film.","I think British men build up the idea of us French girls having some magic extra sex appeal so much, they lose their heads. I can't really understand the whole thing - but it makes me laugh. It's such a cliche to think all French girls are well dressed, elegant, sophisticated and sexy. Some are utter slobs, I promise you that.","England understands good Chinese, Japanese and Indian cuisine; in France, we just get French.","I struggle to watch myself in any scene, to be honest. What's done is done. I wish I was able to watch myself, as it would really help me develop as an actor. But I'm not brave enough. It's a difficult thing to do - looking at yourself as this utterly different person on a screen.","To help people in the third world get educated and learn how to read and write is so important. I mean it is such an important human right.","I love fashion from the 1930s and '40s - shoulder pads, high waists, things with structure. That is classy for me. Andrea Riseborough from the Madonna movie 'W.E.' had an amazing wardrobe.","Traditional British desserts with lots of custard are my biggest weakness - I particularly love the puds at St. John restaurant in East London.","For me, acting is like a therapy. I can express myself fully when I am acting and have blood in my veins. Even when I'm not working, I'm always living in my own world, imagining characters.","At drama school, I always picked the really evil roles. It's a great way to deal with your everyday emotions.","I have Algerian, Turkish, Swedish, Spanish blood: I feel like a citizen of the world. Life and cinema don't have borders.","I'd rather be thought as an international actress rather than a French one. Because I don't know what's coming up for me, my ambition is not to be typecast. So I'm working on my English accent, as well as my American one. I don't want to be like 'Okay, I'm French, and I want to succeed in Hollywood!'"],"Eva Herzigova":["I love photo sessions. I'm alone, I'm the queen, everyone's taking care of me.","I do pottery. I love it. It's very relaxing; it takes me to another planet.","I'm lucky, I don't like sweets, not even chocolate.","My dream is to have a beautiful old house in Monaco.","We are very isolated, far from boyfriends and friends, so we have to be strong, smart and very professional.","I rarely do masks because, if I have any extra time, I'd rather spend it with my friends than on myself.","But I was very much into sports when I was a child.","But I love fish, cheese and meat, and I eat everything, but only in small quantities if it's rich.","I especially love French, Italian and Japanese cuisines.","But for the time being, I've only learned one cake recipe and how to make scrambled eggs.","Yes, I was really good in physics and in math.","History is the key to everything: politics, religion, even fashion.","Six months later I was in Paris. I was 16, and it all started to happen.","Because beauty isn't enough, there must be something more.","A photo is a creation.","I play a role in front of the cameras, just like in the movies.","I'm even embarrassed at times when my friends come upon my pictures.","I didn't have to undergo reconstructive surgery.","For me, it's a compliment to be compared with Marilyn, the unforgettable actress, the most beautiful one of all. But, curves aside, we have very little in common.","I'm very serious; I don't waste my earnings.","I put my money in the bank: I have to think of life after modeling, when I'm not famous any more.","But I also like to shower my parents with presents. I bought them a beautiful car and a house.","I don't think I ever had a swollen head: I remember where I come from.","My mother's a secretary; my father's an electrician in a mining company.","I'm lucky, I can sleep from takeoff until we land; so I'm fresh, rested and ready to work on arrival.","We're constantly buying airplane tickets; we travel on the Concorde.","On my birthday, I was in Milan for the collections.","Otherwise, I spend a lot of time at my boyfriend's home in the country, in New Jersey.","I also love horseback riding in New Jersey.","Ever since I was a very little girl, I've dreamed of acting.","You can't be a model at age 60, but you certainly can be an actress.","Italian men do appreciate beautiful women. They're not afraid of the beauty, which is nice."],"Eva Hesse":["Mushy novels, pretty pictures, pretty sculpture, decorations on the wall, nice parallel lines - make me sick.","I have the most openness about my art... It's total freedom and willingness to work. I'm willing really to walk on the edge, and if I haven't achieved it, that's where I want to go. But in my life - maybe because my life has been so traumatic, so absurd - there hasn't been one normal, happy thing.","Art and life are inseparable.","Artists don't think archivally.","If I'm O.K., I will abandon restrictions and curbs imposed on myself. Not physical ones, but those restrictive tabs on my inner being, on solely myself. I will strip me of superficial dishonesties. I will paint against every rule I or others have invisibly placed.","I am ultimately convinced that people must first be told that so and so is great ,and then, after a period of given time, they come to believe it for themselves.","Don't ask what it means or what it refers to. Don't ask what the work is. Rather, see what the work does.","I should like to achieve free, spontaneous painting delineating a powerful, strong structured image. One must be possible with the other. A difficult problem in itself, but one which I shall achieve.","Everything for me has always been opposites; nothing has ever been in the middle... My life never had anything normal or in the center.","Life doesn't last; art doesn't last. It doesn't matter.","Art is the easiest thing in my life, and that's ironic. It doesn't mean I've worked little on it, but it's the only thing I never had to... I have no fear. I could take risks.","Color is whatever comes out of the material and keeps it what it is.","Maybe if I really believe in me, trust me without any calculated plan, who knows what will happen?","There's not been one normal thing in my life.","I am not sure what my stand on lasting really is."],"Eva LaRue":["Charity should always be a constant.","I grew up at 'All My Children;' I got married, had a daughter and made life-long friends there!","'All My Children' taught me a great work ethic; you work so hard on a soap opera!","The Internet has been a great outlet for storytelling. After all, there are web-based shows that have started online and have then gotten picked up. I think it's a great opportunity for artists to get through the network roadblock. It just allows us another venue to be creative in.","If your potential mate does not have the same perspective that you do then you're going to be lost.","If somebody has never been married, they don't know compromise.","I think that if you start teaching about giving back and helping other people young, that will be a given for your child their whole life."],"Eva Longoria":["I love being a woman. I love the sexiness we get to exude. But the best thing about being a woman is the power we have over men.","I've always said I want a farmer, not a hunter. Hunters go for the kill and they move on. A farmer nurtures; he watches things grow.","Your body is a vehicle of your emotions and a vehicle of feelings and a vehicle of whatever you need to get done in life. And you've got to take care of that vehicle.","I didn't really blossom until my mid teens, and by that time I had to work on my personality to make people like me. I found it easy to make people laugh and I was always pretty popular.","When you're fighting for social justice, one of my biggest pet peeves is speaking out of ignorance.","In the Mexican culture, we never miss a baptism, a birthday, a baby shower, a wedding shower, a wedding. You must show up. Otherwise, you'll be in big trouble.","My worst habit in the kitchen is not allowing anybody to help me. I like to cook by myself.","I was born in Corpus Christi, Texas, the youngest of four girls, including my oldest sister, Lisa, who has special needs. My mom was a special education teacher, and my dad worked on the Army base. We weren't wealthy, but we were determined to succeed.","In my family, there was one cardinal priority - education. College was not an option; it was mandatory. So even though we didn't have a lot of money, we made it work. I signed up for financial aid, Pell Grants, work study, anything I could.","I don't regret anything I ever do or say. I don't like to live my life being censored. I like to say what I feel, and I think people respect that because you're honest.","I got my degree. More importantly, I got a key to American opportunity. That's who we are - a nation that rewards ambition with opportunity. Where hard work can lead to success, no matter where you start.","Everybody needs a chance to find love.","Politics need to stop treating women as a special-interest group.","I'm a tomboy. I love shooting guns and running around.","There's a big difference between charity and between activism and philanthropy. They're very different things and I think, you know, everybody should find a passion or a cause that they can really get behind, but it has to be organic.","I just came into my own sexuality at thirty. I don't think it's something you can deeply experience at 18 or any time before that.","I like being small - I've known so many women with big boobs who feel overweight or end up with back problems.","I'm a fabulous date, I make sure I look good, I like hearing what a guy has to say and I make sure the evening is a real laugh. I like to laugh.","I've always eaten egg whites because when I was little, I didn't like the color yellow, so my mom would trick me into eating eggs by taking out the yolk.","Baking is too precise for me. I cook with a pinch of this or that.","I was making almost minimum wage on 'The Young and the Restless.' But it was my first job, so I accepted my first quote. I had a great time on it, and it obviously led me to better things.","I've always thought of myself as a role model even before being a 'celebrity.' I've always been doing charity work and volunteering in the community since I was 8, so when you do that, I think you just assume that role when you put yourself out there.","I find it a turnoff whenever men aren't into some kind of sport. And, no, video games don't count. I dated a guy who was into video games, and I wanted to shoot myself.","There's no amount of money that would make me decide something for a career.","The Eva Longoria who worked at Wendy's flipping burgers - she needed a tax break. But the Eva Longoria who works on movie sets does not.","I never had a time line for my life. I didn't say I wanted to be married at 28 and have three kids by the time I was 32.","For me, as far as skin, I'm a big advocate of facials. And I moisturize. And I read my magazines. I listen to good advice from people who really know, and I try to watch what I eat.","I was born in platform heels. I actually always fall down when I'm wearing flip-flops.","To be with the same person for the rest of your life just sounds so drab.","You can't have a relationship when you're shooting a 14-hour day and your husband is shooting a 14-hour day in the same city. It's a time thing and it's a together thing.","I think what destroys Hollywood marriages is our work schedule, not so much infidelity.","My acting is still being recognized for the fact that I wasn't nominated.","I am treated no different than the other girls.","I'll talk about my Tony all day long.","So, I'm the Eighth Wonder of the World. It's flattering and very, very funny.","I'm on the ground, I've been in swing states, I've been talking to the American people, I've been out there speaking on behalf of Obama's record, I've been in the trenches.","I'm very literate on policy. I'm very literate on the issues, and I'm an American first. I've been involved in politics long before I was an actress. I just happen to have a platform now. I just happen to have a voice.","I find it irresponsible to go, 'She's an actress, what does she know?' That means if you're a dentist, what do you know? If you're a lawyer, what do you know? It's our profession, it's what we do. It's not who we are.","Immigration is not the top issue for Latinos. Latinos are like every other American - economy, jobs, healthcare, education.","I am honored to be here as co-chair of President Obama's re-election campaign.","We face a choice this election. President Obama is fighting for changes that grow the economy from the middle out and help all Americans succeed - jobs, education, health reform, the DREAM Act, equal pay for women. He is moving us forward with opportunity today for prosperity tomorrow. Mitt Romney wants to take us back to yesterday.","We know what we need to do. Let's re-elect President Obama!","I do like British guys. If I had to pick one it would be Ewan McGregor. I met him once and he was gorgeous, even if he is a little short. He has the most amazing charisma.","I have a personal trainer who comes over at least four times a week and kicks my butt. I get so sore that I can't even walk.","I do want to have a family at some point. I also want to adopt. I don't feel pressure to have kids because I know that there are so many out there.","I wish I could wear 10 dresses to my wedding. It's so sad that you put it in storage and then never see it again. I am going to sleep in mine after I wear it.","Who I am at the core and what I think represents me is really reflected in my family.","I learned French before I learned Spanish.","I think what I love most about Oprah's brand that I would love to do with the Eva Longoria brand is she has purpose with her brand. Everything she does means something.","I'm naturally athletic. I've been involved in sports since I could walk. So, for me to be sedentary is just unacceptable. Not only is it great for your physical body, but it gives me more energy during the day if I've worked out. I feel better. I look better.","I'm a terrific Mexican cook, and I just love Mexican food. And I love cooking Mexican food.","I'm very proud of my sisters and everything they've accomplished and done. I'm very proud of where I came from.","You don't need to know who I'm dating. You don't need to know what I'm doing. I'm fine with everybody not knowing that.","I grew up on a ranch with my father, so he educated us really early on about guns. We used to go target shooting all the time.","I would say 80% of the scripts I get are dramas and not comedies or romantic comedies, which is funny because that's what I do every week.","I think I've ignored it so much so that when the paparazzi are following me I really don't see them. You don't see them anymore.","It's not a party unless I'm cooking. Some people find entertaining stressful, but it is therapeutic for me; I find it relaxing.","I could never give up Mexican food. Nachos are usually my go-to if I'm courtside at an NBA game. I always, always get my picture taken with my mouth wide open and a tortilla chip sticking out of it!","I'm not a matchmaker. I'm a horrible matchmaker. I always try. I'm not very good.","On a television show, you basically make a movie a week. Movies take three months - it's crazy. They're so slow, it's like vacation to me.","I don't regret anything I do, ever, whether articles I've done or things I've said. And as far as what's happened in the past, I wouldn't take anything back.","Even though I am very tied to and close to my heritage, I learned Spanish in college; I didn't grow up with it. Growing up in South Texas is different from Miami or L.A. where it is a necessity to speak Spanish.","I've been studying the Constitution for myself but also as a way for me, as a Democrat, to comprehend the Right. I think it's important that people who are politically active understand both sides."],"Eva Marie Saint":["As you get older, you're doing different parts, but the young people, like yourself, they keep you excited, because they'll see Waterfront, and they'll want to talk about it.","I can't sit around having coffee. I have all these appointments, and a lot of my friends sit around having coffee talking about the jobs they didn't get.","It all has to do with the director, the captain of the ship. He sets the pace, the mood. If the director is quiet, the set is quiet. If the director is loud, then everybody has to be louder to be heard.","What is it like when you see me in all these films and then you meet me? Were you intimidated?","You know, you do it, and you get paid for it, and you have a wonderful time, then you're on to something else.","The longer you live, I believe, you learn so much about life that you have more to give.","I find a lot of swearing in films. And I guess that shows my age. But I also feel that where they say those words, they could just as easily have written other words.","The longer you live, the smarter you get because you've been around. You've seen things. You've gone through different emotional experiences in your own life, and hopefully, you understand things better. And that makes you a better actress.","I had an agent once who wanted me to make many more movies. I said, 'I can't. I can only do one a year, if that. I have children, young children.' And he said, 'Well, I guess you won't be a superstar.' And I said, 'Well, I guess not.'","I was Sweater Queen at Bowling Green State University. Oh, that's a laugh, isn't it?","I don't think a lot of people - when they associate you with Hollywood, they don't want to think of you as normal. They want to hear, you know, all the stuff in Hollywood.","I want to show people that if you walk, if you eat the right things, if you don't have stuff done to your face - that's okay.","I was in awe of Robert Osborne, the man, and his incredible talent. Like everyone else, I loved watching him introduce classic films on TCM. But I was fortunate to also get to know him in real life by spending time with him and being interviewed by him over the years at events around the country.","You know how to stay young? Go with the flow.","You reach a certain age, and you're so proud that you're walking and breathing and loving and working and all of that at 90.","I met older actresses who never married, never had children. That's not for me.","There are too many awards shows.","My mom lived to be 91, and her advice was, 'Honey, just keep moving.'","My dad was Quaker and a businessman.","I don't wake up and say, 'Gee, it's a nice day, and I'm a legend.'","I hear the theme from 'Psycho' every time I take a shower. I lock the door.","I am very patient. I take pride in being patient with my husband, my children, my grandchildren.","When people think of a Hitchcock movie, it isn't just the visual, it's the sound.","I was in the chorus in high school, not a soloist. I was on the basketball team. I was in modern dance, part of the group. I was a cheerleader, part of the group. I played the violin, part of the orchestra. I never wanted to be out there alone. Ever.","I can watch movies that I've been in, and if there's an emotional scene, I remember specifically what I was using, what I was thinking about, because I am very specific in how I work.","Actors can be good, say all these beautiful, wonderful things - but where does it come from? It comes from the writers, and people kind of forget that sometimes.","I don't get nervous on a stage; I don't get nervous in interviews. I don't get nervous.","I cried when I saw how flat Toledo was.","People enjoy being read to, beginning from when they're little.","I just want to do some movies that my children and my grandchildren would be proud of. That's my yardstick."],"Eva Mendes":["I don't usually lose my temper, but if I get angry, it's true - I'm scary.","I'm a modern woman in the sense of I take care of myself, I'm fiercely independent, and I'm really ambitious. Yet I have these old-school thoughts in my mind.","Even if you buy a fur glove with the little trim, and you think 'Oh, my God, it's just a little trim,' that animal got clubbed.","I love it, but it's not important to me to always be thought of as sexy. I like it when it doesn't limit my career. It's a part of my life, but on a secondary plane.","I'm definitely responsible for the image that I put out there. But it does become frustrating, because I don't want 'sexy' to be my defining characteristic. I'd love for my ambition and will and intellect and sense of humour to define me as well.","I love therapy! There's nothing like talking to someone who has no emotional tie to your life.","People are incapable of stereotyping you; you stereotype yourself because you're the one who accepts roles that put you in this rut or in this stereotype.","I make conscious decisions to stay out of the limelight. Without my make-up I'm pretty much the girl next door.","I love every aspect of being a woman. I believe you should celebrate who you are.","I feel I'll take on the responsibility of showing the world a whole different kind of Latin woman.","I do like to belong to a man.","We seem okay with violence, but nudity we race to criticize and censor.","I've been with the same person for a very long time but I'm just non-conventional in that way. I don't think people need to be married. I think a lot of people need that piece of paper, but I don't think everybody needs that to feel secure.","I know I walk a fine line between being a respected actor and being what they call a sex symbol.","I might act like it's an accident but the opposite is true. I'm incredibly calculated when it comes to my career.","I love having a man in my life, and being his woman at the end of the day. I know it's a dichotomy.","I love my country, but I believe that we are too quick to censor nudity.","Actors used to carry films because people would have to actually go to the movies to see them. It was the only place. But now there's none of that mystique, and so there's less of a reason to buy a ticket.","Personally, I think wearing a baby chinchilla says, 'I'm ignorant.'","Once we got the scene down, we were told to improv.","I speak English without an accent, and I speak Spanish without an accent. I really do have the best of both worlds.","I'm not an exhibitionist. But, honestly, for my art I'll do anything almost. I'll go there.","When people write lies about you, and you know that they are lies, that means that they don't know the truth.","I'm very comfortable with myself and my sexuality, but it doesn't define me. I also read books believe it or not.","I try not to go crazy, but yes, I pay attention to what I eat.","I've never had a problem with nudity, but I don't put it out there without a reason.","I just want to be known for things other than my sexuality.","'Anchorman' is my favorite movie of all time and Ron Burgundy is one of my favorite characters of all time. It's my 'Gone With the Wind.'","I don't like my men to be too ornate. I like them to stand back and let their women shine, and they should really wear the pants in the relationship.","But I've never felt objectified. Nothing you see me do is an accident.","Maybe something that's acceptable in your teens or 20s is unacceptable in your 30s or 40s.","I'm a trained actress and I can do it, but I think that you have to prove yourself."],"Eva Moskowitz":["Excellence is the accumulation of hundreds of minute decisions; it is execution at the most granular level. Once you accept the idea that you should give in to things that make no sense because other people do those things and you want to appear reasonable, you are on a path towards mediocrity.","Self-delusion is rarely a good strategy for effective management.","I am a Democrat and disagree with virtually all of President Trump's policy positions, including those on healthcare, LGBTQ rights, civil rights, immigration, global warming, gun control, and tax 'reform.'","One of the biggest reasons that teachers have trouble with student-centered learning is that they have to give over a level of control to the kids. And, when you do that, you can have chaos, or you can have high levels of learning. Often, teachers are afraid of the chaos.","Whatever you think rigor looks like, you should go up a few notches.","I have always been very open about my respect for public service.","Parents who don't like Success should find a school they do like. For someone to enroll their child at Success and insist we change our model is like a person walking into a pizzeria and demanding sushi. If you want sushi, go to a sushi restaurant!","Sometimes when kids look like they're daydreaming, it's because they are, and we can't allow that possibility.","I think it's fairly unique to define the end goal of K-12 schooling as helping students become better thinkers, more creative thinkers, and to organize the whole school around creative and critical thinking.","I didn't design schools for poor kids. I'm designing schools to be world-class.","To me, that is really fundamental to social justice: to have choices in life.","I believe Betsy DeVos has the talent, commitment, and leadership capacity to revitalize our public schools and deliver the promise of opportunity that excellent education provides, and I support her nomination as U.S. Secretary of Education.","What you get is what you see, which is suspending kids doesn't lead to high attrition rate. That is what the data shows.","I'm troubled by what I see as a sort of rooting for Trump's failure, because that is rooting for our own failure.","I wouldn't be educating children if I did not believe in human potential.","I am from an F.D.R. liberal-Democratic family. With proximity to government, I have become more libertarian.","I want kids to be able to escape failing schools that trap them. And it's an unequal trapping of children. The most affluent find a way to escape. They move to a great suburban district or send their kid to a private school. The people who are trapped in the worst schools that have been terrible often for half a century? Those are the poorest kids.","Attacking school segregation requires all hands on deck. We in the charter sector must move beyond our traditional comfort zone, serving disadvantaged students, and meet the demands of parents who have other high quality options.","Suspensions convey the critical message to students and parents that certain behavior is inconsistent with being a member of the school community. Pretend suspensions, in which a student is allowed to remain in the school community, do not convey that message.","It is very challenging to have a kind of data-driven, performance-oriented culture and to do progressive pedagogy. These things don't naturally, or easily, go together.","It's one thing to have a president with whose politics you disagree; it's another to have a president who doesn't even seem to care about your welfare.","I thought I was leaving elected office and politics in order to focus on schooling, but as you know, schooling turns out to be frankly even more political than politics.","I'm very, very focused on not only creating world class schools at scale, but changing the public policy in this country that every day prevents children from getting access to the American dream.","We must renew our commitment to instilling high moral character in our students, to teaching them to treat each other with kindness, to stand up for what is right, and to respect the diversity of backgrounds and experiences that strengthen our country.","As I explained when I announced that I was turning down a potential opportunity to serve as Secretary of Education, I voted for Hillary Clinton and was sorely disappointed she didn't win.","Like so many of you, I am deeply distressed both by the hateful violence in Charlottesville and by President Trump's refusal to clearly denounce it. Nobody with any empathy for the plight of people of color in this country could respond the way he did.","I love working with teachers and principals; they are my heroes. They are very dedicated to children, and it's very impactful.","In New York City, the idea that district schools advance equality is a myth.","I assure you: If I were to hear a teacher raise a voice at a kid or anything, that goes against the model, and I would immediately address it.","I took my teaching responsibilities very seriously... I taught some great courses: Legal history to feminist theory, courses in American mass culture... I love teaching - I mean really love it.","I've never believed the charter movement was exclusively for socially and economically disadvantaged kids.","Schools can ebb and flow. It can be phenomenal one day, and then you hit fractions, and it falls apart.","Rule number one of journalism is that trying to get in between a journalist and a story he wants to tell is like trying to stop a herd of stampeding cattle.","Most teachers in America could dramatically improve their teaching if they just made every second count.","No matter how good a teacher is, if that teacher won't play as part of the team, you're better off without her.","If the day ever comes when I think something is okay simply because district schools do it, I hope my board fires me.","Success isn't ideal for every child. If we think a child would do better in a different school, whether it's a specialized program or just a school with a different approach, we'll tell a parent that, as we should.","Part of me would love to be mayor for the simple reason that I love my city.","I believe education is a bipartisan issue, and I intend to support those educational policies of President Trump with which I agree.","Any elected official who asks to visit my schools is welcome to do so; there is no political litmus test.","Why doesn't anyone care that the schools in Harlem have been unsuccessful for half a century? Why is this not a big deal? To me, it's a terrible deal.","If student A 'impacts' student B with a fist, they shouldn't 'dialogue as equals.' Student A should be disciplined. When you assault your co-worker or curse out your boss, you don't get a 'restorative circle' - you get fired."],"Eva Simons":["Music is real when it goes inside you. You know when you really love someone, and you look into their eyes and you know it's real? Even though I'm an electronic artist, I wanna keep it real.","With the 'Silly Boy' track, I mean, people knew about it, but it wasn't really like, 'oh that's Eva Simons.' But when 'Take Over Control' came out, that's when people started to get interested in me personally, which is great because it was something I really believed in.","Sometimes when I'm dancing and don't put in enough hairspray, I wind up looking like a... what's the animal with needles? Porcupine.","I'm just a girl from Amsterdam. It's a small city. Everybody knows Amsterdam, but it's still a small city. To come from there, to work with Will. i. am... it's like, 'What happened?! What did I do right?'","I got into a conversation with EMI, and they said they were very interested in releasing the song because it was such a huge hit online. RCA and Universal were also very interested, but EMI were the best team, so I decided to sign with them. I got my deal because 'Silly Boy' leaked, so obviously now I'm very happy about what happened!","I want to have a huge album that's, like, 18 or 19 tracks. I hate those albums where there's only, like, ten tracks, and you're left thinking, 'Is this it?'"],"Eva Vertes":["For so long, the mainstays of cancer treatment have been chemotherapy and radiation. They're toxic and primitive. We need to look at it in a rational way and say, how can we help the body heal itself?","Prevention is a very important part of solving the problem of cancer.","It seems that cancer is a direct result to injury. If you smoke, you damage your lung tissue, and then lung cancer arises. If you drink, you damage your liver, and then liver cancer occurs.","I decided to take two years between finishing undergraduate and beginning medical school to devote fully to medical research. I knew that I wanted to go to medical school during undergraduate, but I was also eager to get a significant amount of research experience.","It is becoming clear that many diseases - especially cancer - are highly complex and may respond better to a multi-drug approach which targets many different aspects of a disease process.","When I was about 9 years old, I became very interested in the human body and diseases. In general, I was just curious about the world around me. I think that any sort of curiosity as a child is a good beginning to a career in science because science, at least to me, is a continuous exploration of the unknown.","My grandmother was a chemist. She worked at the Banting Institute in Toronto, and at 44 she died of stomach cancer. I never met my grandmother, but I carry on her name - her exact name, Eva Vertes - and I like to think I carry on her scientific passion, too.","Muscle is constantly being used - constantly being damaged. If every time we tore a muscle or every time we stretched a muscle or moved in a wrong way, cancer occurred - I mean, everybody would have cancer almost.","I don't want to say, 'I want to cure cancer.' It's such a grand thing. People have been trying for so long and we're not getting very far. But I do want to try to understand it better, and I want to make some forward movement."],"Eva Zeisel":["Modernism, rebelling against the ornament of the 19th century, limited the vocabulary of the designer. Modernism emphasized straight lines, eliminating the expressive S curve. This made it harder to communicate emotions through design.","I never wanted to do something grotesque. I never wanted to shock. I wanted my audience to be happy, to be kind.","I don't like to design single objects. I like my pieces to have a relationship to each other. They can be mother and child, like the Schmoo salt and pepper shakers, or brother and sister like the Birdie salt and peppers, or cousins, like most of my dinnerware sets.","When you have clay in your hands, it's hard to avoid making birds.","Beautiful things make people happy.","The designer must understand that form does not follow function nor does form follow a production process. For every use and for every production process there are innumerable equally attractive solutions.","When I design something, I think of it as a gift to somebody else.","If I hadn't been a designer, I'd have been a painter. I began as a painter and learned the craft of pottery in order to support myself.","My time in Weimar Berlin was the most elegant in my life. I would have parties for a hundred people - writers, scientists, artists.","My designs are meant to attract the hand as well as the eye.","Art has more ego to it than what I do.","I don't know the difference between working and not working.","When I met my designs in the market of a remote village in the West Indies, or in the airport restaurant in Zurich, I felt like the mother of many well-behaved children.","My work is very bodily. It's not a shell, but a body.","Men have no concept of how to design things for the home. Women should design the things they use.","I am a maker of useful things.","I don't call myself an 'industrial designer,' because I'm other things. Industrial designers want to make novel things. Novelty is a concept of commerce, not an aesthetic concept."],"Evan Bayh":["We know that a college degree is rapidly becoming the price of admission to the global economy.","Sometimes you have to make tough decisions to hold the line on spending.","Mothers - especially single mothers - are heroic in their efforts to raise our nation's children, but men must also take responsibility for their children and recognize the impact they have on their families' well-being.","We need leaders who appeal to us to think about something other than narrow self-interest but instead focus upon the greater good.","To win the war on terror, we must know who our friends are and where our enemies are hiding. We can't continue fighting terrorism using the same foreign policy blueprints that were in place before September 11th.","Ultimately, the American people ourselves need to decide we care more about practical solutions and progress than we do about brain-dead ideology and political wrangling.","Challenges of historic import threaten America's future. Action on the deficit, economy, energy, health care and much more is imperative, yet our legislative institutions fail to act. Congress must be reformed.","What matters is moving forward and focusing on practical results for the American people.","Companies that are publicly held have a fiduciary duty to their shareholders to try to maximize their profits within ethical reasons.","Many good people serve in Congress. They are patriotic, hard-working, and devoted to the public good as they see it, but the institutional and cultural impediments to change frustrate the intentions of these well-meaning people as rarely before.","The United States must not allow North Korea to exacerbate tensions between our key strategic allies in Asia. As the leader of the free world, the United States needs to support our regional allies who are standing up to a Stalinist regime that is intent on developing nuclear weapons.","I intend to continue to fight for the things I think are right for my country.","I've always cared about education, and I worked with Senator Schumer on making several thousand dollars of college tuition tax deductible. That will help a lot of your middle class families make college more affordable.","Every once in a while, an election comes along, and who you are and what you believe gets subsumed in a larger tide. It just happens.","America is stronger than ever. We will forever remember those we lost on September 11, 2001. In honoring their memory, we will remain true to our commitment to freedom and democracy.","Across the country military families are facing dire financial circumstances due to longer than expected tours of duties. They are being penalized for their patriotism - no one should have to choose between doing right by their country and doing right by their families.","We must do all we can to help improve the deplorable human rights situation of the North Korean people.","We should be proud of liberating the 26 million people in Iraq and should remember that this is why it is important to stick it out to it's successful conclusion.","Our success as a party will largely be determined by how well we do here in the heartland... The time has come to be secure about our values. The time has come to lead.","If I could create one job in the private sector by helping to grow a business, that would be one more than Congress has created in the last six months.","Filibusters should require 35 senators to... make a commitment to continually debate an issue in reality, not just in theory. The number of votes needed to overcome a filibuster should be reduced to 55 from 60.","What is required from members of Congress and the public alike is a new spirit of devotion to the national welfare beyond party or self-interest.","People come into public life for different reasons. None of us are ego-challenged, I think, or we probably wouldn't be doing what we're doing, so if anyone tells you that they don't like the sound of the applause and the ego gratification, I don't think they're being straight with you.","If one of my boys was asking me if they should go into politics, I'd say there's only one reason to go into public life and that's to help people.","You now have six-year campaigns for the Senate - you never stop running. It's not uncommon for a member of the Senate to have a fundraising breakfast, a fundraising lunch and a fundraising dinner, and then when the Senate breaks for the week to go home, more fundraisers. And that's driven by the cost of campaigning.","My first meeting as a senator, my first day, they were already talking about the next election. Part of that's the permanent campaign, part of that's a word I've been using more frequently, 'tribal.' Our politics has become tribal: It's us versus them.","Baseball may be our national pastime, but the age-old tradition of taking a swing at Congress is a sport with even deeper historical roots in the American experience. Since the founding of our country, citizens from Ben Franklin to David Letterman have made fun of their elected officials.","Filibusters have proliferated because under current rules just one or two determined senators can stop the Senate from functioning. Today, the mere threat of a filibuster is enough to stop a vote; senators are rarely asked to pull all-nighters like Jimmy Stewart in 'Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.'","Of course, the genesis of a good portion of the gridlock in Congress does not reside in Congress itself. Ultimate reform will require each of us, as voters and Americans, to take a long look in the mirror, because in many ways, our representatives in Washington reflect the people who have sent them there.","I'm pleased to offer analysis of public policy and politics to the millions of Americans who get their news from Fox.","The amount of U.S. debt held by countries such as China and Japan is at a historic high, with foreign investors holding half of America's publicly held debt. This dependence raises the specter that other nations will be able to influence our policies in ways antithetical to American interests.","Families and businesses are tightening their belts to make ends meet - and Washington should too.","As Indiana's governor, I balanced eight budgets, never raised taxes, and left the largest surplus in state history. It wasn't always easy. Cuts had to be made and some initiatives deferred. Occasionally I had to say 'no.'","I love working for the people of Indiana. I love helping our citizens make the most of their lives, but I do not love Congress.","I've had a growing conviction that Congress is not operating as it should. There is much too much partisanship and not enough progress.","What we need to do is to come together as a people and solve the problems facing our country. And unfortunately, Washington is just not doing enough of that these days.","Hoosiers are very independent.","If I could help educate our children at an institution for higher learning, that would be a noble thing.","You wouldn't run for the United States Senate or for governor or for anything else without answering people's questions about what you believe. And I think the Supreme Court is no different.","Bob Corker's a very reasonable person.","In Indiana, we don't have an official state religion, but if we did, it would be basketball.","There's a high level of frustration with the two-party system out there.","You just hope that we haven't soured an entire generation on the necessity, from time to time, of using force because Iraq has been such a debacle. That would be tragic because Iran is a grave threat.","I believe I would be a very strong general-election candidate.","Washington is totally out of touch with mainstream America.","The only way Democrats can govern in this country is by making common cause with moderates and independents.","We shouldn't have someone working in the Oval Office trying to discredit and smear a private individual who's just speaking their mind about an important issue facing the country. That is not going to move our nation forward.","Sometimes making progress a step at a time is better than no progress at all.","If, by demanding revolutionary change, I run the risk of accomplishing nothing on behalf of the public, then I'm not sure that's a responsible course of action.","Between being governor and part of the Senate, one of the things I did was I held a chair at the business school at my alma mater, Indiana University. And I'd go to lecture the graduates, and I loved that, answering their questions. It was real; it was tangible, and it was making a difference every day.","No one ever built the filibuster rule. It just kind of was created.","My father was on the Judiciary Committee all 18 years. He had a good personal relationship with Jim Eastland. They probably didn't agree on practically anything, or very little, from a public policy standpoint. But they were willing to work through that to see what they could get done just because they knew each other and liked each other.","While romanticizing the Senate of yore would be a mistake, it was certainly better in my father's time.","My father, Birch Bayh, represented Indiana in the Senate from 1963 to 1981. A progressive, he nonetheless enjoyed many friendships with moderate Republicans and Southern Democrats.","It shouldn't take a constitutional crisis or an attack on the nation to create honest dialogue in the Senate.","Sometimes, it takes leaving to gain some perspective. I see that clearly every time I leave Washington, D.C., and return to Indiana. I see the bizarre bubble that seems to enclose the Beltway and makes people forget what regular people care about.","Through our own hard work and ingenuity, America has spent much of its history as the world's dominant economic power. But our dominance is not pre-ordained - history does not roll along on the wheels of inevitability.","A few decades ago, the Irish decided they were tired of being always near the bottom of Europe's economic indicators. So they envisioned a better future for their country, and they put their people on the right road to get there.","Americans have always prized individuality - it is part of our national DNA - but America is a community that draws strength from the sum of our people and has always known that the total of that sum is worth far more than its individual parts.","We need a foreign policy that is both tough... and smart. The good news? That is the historic legacy of the Democratic Party.","As Democrats, we have a patriotic duty and political imperative to lay out our ideas for protecting America.","As with any difficult challenge that the public and policymakers face, there is no single solution or silver bullet that will serve as the answer to how the United States works to reduce carbon emissions.","China's island-building in the South China Sea poses a threat to U.S. national security interests in the region.","The United States depends on South Korea and Japan to help promote American values in East Asia.","Sometimes, when I come back to Washington from Indiana, I feel like an ambassador to a foreign country.","It doesn't take a degree in economics to know that something is wrong when it takes $30 or $40 to fill up the gas tank.","I'm a former governor, and so I was the chief executive, and when the legislature wasn't in session, I was running the state.","If you are the executive, you're probably going to have more of an impact than if you're one of a hundred members of the Senate, certainly one of 435 members of the House.","I like a lot of my Republican colleagues, starting with my friend from Indiana, Senator Lugar. We've had an excellent relationship.","Tim Kaine is a good man.","I've never stopped being a Hoosier.","Any time a president is re-elected, he has a little more political clout to get things done.","Those who obstruct the Senate should pay a price in public notoriety and physical exhaustion. That would lead to a significant decline in frivolous filibusters.","I care about family issues.","My mother wrote a book. Unfortunately, it ended up being published posthumously. But I'm glad she did, because it taught me a lot about my family that, otherwise, I probably wouldn't know.","We all have things in life we'd do over again.","Massive debts owed to foreign creditors weaken our global influence and threaten high inflation and steep tax increases for our children and grandchildren.","The fastest-growing part of the Pentagon's budget are health care expenses.","I find the world just too complex to embrace a single ideological point of view.","I love my father, and I believe in him. And he lost to Dan Quayle. I had a hard time understanding how that could happen.","To regain our political footing, we must prove to moderates that Democrats can make tough choices.","The most important area for spending restraint is entitlement reform.","Any time a party has lost three consecutive elections, it becomes a bit more willing to explore the notion of principled compromise so it's able to pursue some of its objectives."],"Evan Dando":["I used to have a sort of spiky haircut and it just feels better to have short hair again.","I don't like alcohol, but I still like to mess around with other stuff occasionally. I think it's important I take mushrooms and acid. They're certainly not addictive, so I can't rule that out.","You know more about me than I do about myself, that's probably true.","When there are no women on the tour it can get awful and ugly - constant horrible jokes and gross behaviour. It needs to be leavened with a feminine presence.","When I write a song, it's all about the riff - the riff first, then the words come later.","When I was 14 years old, I was a huge fan of the Velvets, the Stooges and the Modern Lovers. They are my three favourite bands. I never get sick of 'em.","The best songs I write in 20 minutes.","Some of our stuff ends up looking too corporate. I'm going to be a lot stricter from now on.","Since Elizabeth, I certainly live a healthier lifestyle.","See, to me, rock'n'roll doesn't have any point. It's just fun. It has a million different angles and they're all valid. But I think rock might be a world issue.","Rock stars wanting to write is even worse than wanting to act in movies, right?","My high-school dream was to be in a band, pay my rent and eat - and I've been able to do that for 20 years. So I'm completely content.","It's better when you have your wife with you, more fun.","It is hard, though, 'cos record labels love to boss you around. I won't let them do that anymore.","I've got time, I hope, to make lots of quiet records. So quiet you won't be able to hear them.","I'd forgotten what it was like to play music and have it be fun so I decided to stop. I wasn't even sure if I was going to make a new record, I was just kinda quitting.","I was trying to spend it as quickly as possible. Because I'm so lazy, all that money created a block. I was flying around the world, staying at fancy hotels, having fun and trying to get rid of it as quickly as possible, so I could get on with some more work.","I was hanging out with Jonathan Richman last night.","I need the money. People don't understand how little money you make in a band.","I lie around and play guitar, that's something I do for sure. In fact that's all I do, I think.","I have to make rock records occasionally.","I guess I'm about ready to promote myself in a more human way. I don't feel quite so insecure.","I don't write down my experiences, but I have a very decent memory. I have tons of books in which I write down phrases as they occur to me. That's how I write songs. I'll need a line and I'll go through the books and find it, the right rhyme and everything.","For me, it's all about The Dubliners by James Joyce. I love The Dead.","Even the bands I dig don't have a history of attaining mass consumption.","CDs, too. Totally corporate. They look real cheap and soulless and they don't smell of anything.","But ya have to make videos in the States. Usually ours just look too serious. We haven't got it together.","But Sneaky Pete was great. I didn't bug him about Gram. Not too much, anyway.","Basically, between 1989 and 1994, I hadn't taken a vacation."],"Evan Daugherty":["After 'Divergent,' I got a job rewriting a sci-fi script at Paramount. I think they really liked what I did, so I got a call saying, 'We're about to shoot 'Ninja Turtles' in three or four months; do you wanna come in and do a little work on the script?' That was the beginning of a many-month 'Ninja Turtle' odyssey.","I wrote this script in 2003, when I was a humble college student, sitting in my boxers and writing in my dorm room. And I came up with the idea of writing an action-based 'Snow White,' with this kind of Huntsman character as kind of a way in. So, that's something I'm sort of proud of.","No one prepared me for the stress and insanity of a week leading up to a movie. Years and years of work come down to three days.","Those are the two best words in English, 'Bidding' and 'war'.","I didn't write 'Snow White' for any class, but I got bitten by the screenwriting bug and wrote a couple of scripts in my spare time instead of going to keg parties or something.","'Lord of the Rings' was going on; like, my college years were the years of 'Lord of the Rings,' an awesome time to be in film school.","I loved 'Star Wars' as a kid, but I missed out on the experiences of seeing them for the first time. It was before my time, and 'Lord of the Rings,' that trilogy felt like something similar to what 'Star Wars' was for previous generations.","I never really knew that I would be a lifer of strong female characters, but that seems to be the drops I'm being given, and I'm very happy for them. Hopefully, 'Divergent' will be the next thing.","Reviewers are certainly entitled to their own opinions. I've become buddies with enough writers and directors, and to be perfectly honest, the ones that have lasted a long time don't pay a lot of attention to the reviews.","Very often, things that people may think come from the writer, very often don't. There's a lot of cooks in the kitchen when it comes to making a movie. When you hear a line of dialogue that sounds kind of tinny, it's pretty easy to cite the screenwriter. But there's a lot of stuff that goes into making a movie.","As a writer, you sit around a computer all day, and it's too easy to open another tab and keep Rotten Tomatoes there.","The truth is, there are probably eight more 'Snow White' scripts floating around out there. And once one 'Snow White' script got hot, other people started pulling out their 'Snow White' scripts.","That TV show, 'After Thought,' is really exciting. It's a cross between 'Inception' and 'CSI' that I'm working on with Melissa Rosenberg from the 'Twilight' movies.","I wouldn't say I see things visually first, but what I do think is important, for a lot of screenwriters, is to not just think about the words on the page, but also the world as a whole and the vibe of the movie, rather than a sequence of scenes written on the page.","A script is a unique literary form, because it's not the end product; it's a blueprint. If you're not thinking of that end product, there's going to be a disconnect.","I love intricate plotting and exciting twists, but I realize more that people enjoy a good story in a simple, focused way.","In 'Snow White and the Hunstman,' when we see them in the Dark Forest, you're allowed a lot of freedom to be able to cutaway to, for instance, the prince. That B and C story stuff helps the writing process, even though it makes it a more complicated movie.","I went back to Dallas for a little while to finish my short film 'Rusty Forkblade.' It was not the instant success I thought it was going to be. There's a false narrative that if you make a short film right after senior year, you'll be plucked out to make a feature length film, and the rest is history. I didn't do that.","The absolute base-level thing that you do as a new screenwriter is send out query letters. Literally, you just say, 'Hi, Mr. So-and-So,' and you give them a one-sentence description of one of your scripts. You send it out to a list of people you found on the Internet.","Most scripts that get written in Hollywood don't go anywhere."],"Evan Davis":["It's not a bad idea to occasionally spend a little time thinking about things you take for granted. Plain everyday things.","A chair's function is not just to provide a place to sit; it is to provide a medium for self-expression. Chairs are about status, for example. Or signalling something about oneself. That's why the words chair, seat and bench have found themselves used to describe high status professions, from academia to Parliament to the law.","One of the key problems is that the Germans know what they do because everywhere they go there's a 'made in Germany' label on it - they can feel proud of Volkswagens and Audis and Mercedes.","We are more likely to cheat if we see others doing so. We tend to conform to accepted norms of reasonable behaviour, rather than adhere to strict rules.","Most people hugely underestimate the amount of 'empty space' we have in our country. Fly over the U.K., and you see that human settlement does not fill up the U.K. at all. It accounts for something of the order of 15 per cent of the landmass.","Men don't know much about women. We do know when they're happy. We know when they're crying, and we know when they're pissed off. We just don't know in what order these are gonna come at us.","Britain, however, has ended up specializing in the ones you don't see as much of: defense aerospace, making drive shafts for cars, pills and drugs, designing chips that go into 94 percent of the world's mobile phones.","Someday we'll look back on this moment and plow into a parked car.","When a population saves a lot, the funds are invested outside the country as well as inside. If the Japanese invest in the United States, it pushes their exchange rate down and makes their manufacturing more competitive.","Art can help a town by attracting a certain Bohemian population that adds life to the bars, character to the streets and a buzz to the name. Employers may then follow. But art can't do much if every town does it. There aren't enough Bohemians.","Although being economics editor sounds impressive, it does not mean I actually edit anything. It mainly reflects two decades of title-inflation at the BBC, which has given ever more status to senior reporters, presumably because it is cheaper to do that than to offer higher pay.","Nice guys finish last, but we get to sleep in.","I don't keep it secret that I live with my partner Gio. I'm very proud of my gayness. But there is lots I wouldn't want the press to write about me... it is a matter of regret that being gay is the most interesting thing about me.","Reducing every issue to an argument can become stale but it's often a very good way of clarifying issues.","It's amazing, if you know what you want to say, how fast it is to write.","I don't want to sound like 'chirpy Evan' who's just bouncing around with his unrealistic views and doesn't understand what's going on.","What comes with a job as a staff member of the BBC is a certain self-censoring that you get utterly used to. You don't say everything you think. You hold back on some things.","I swing both ways. I can see things from a kind of conservative point of view and from a more socially liberal or left-wing point of view.","Mistakes are nothing to be ashamed of.","It doesn't annoy me but I think of myself as a presenter who is gay, rather than a gay presenter. It's a subtle distinction, but that's how I view it.","The Germans are clear about what they do - cars and machine tools; the Japanese are clear about what they do - electronics; the Chinese are clear about what they do - they're the workshop of the world.","If you're not making some mistakes, it probably means you're not trying hard enough.","The new industries are brainy industries and so-called knowledge workers tend to like to be near other people who are the same. Think of the City of Hollywood. People cluster. This means you have winning regions, such as London and Cambridge, and losing regions. The people who want to be top lawyers in Sunderland are hoovered up by London.","There is a strong link between the following three things: exporting, manufacturing and the degree of saving by the population. It's complicated, but if the population doesn't save, the economy will not tend to export as much, and if it doesn't export as much, it won't manufacture enough.","For me, the main principle for broadcasters has to be that if people stand to benefit from an interview, they should be prepared to face some downside as well.","At the BBC we've had plenty of women in good management jobs. It comes and goes but there's been plenty. On air, I think there's quite a bit more we can do.","Personally, I'd like us to have a few more women on the 'Today' programme.","Crossrail is a prime example of infrastructure. It is a rather deadly word, but I think it is exciting stuff, the civil engineering which makes Britain tick - the bridges, tunnels, power and water networks, which bind us together.","Now undoubtedly, we face some very British challenges when it comes to infrastructure. We rightly cherish our back yards and green spaces, and we'll defend them passionately when projects are announced. We live in a democracy, and we like to debate these things, often for many years.","Historically, the British have always been rather wary of grand engineering projects - perhaps understandably, given that many of them have been delivered late and over budget.","I don't particularly like going on about being gay or making a big thing about it, but I think it's a bit of a pain to be secretive about it.","The two questions that anyone ever asks me are: 'Are house prices going to go down?' and 'Is it a good time to fix my mortgage rate?'","I actually profoundly think the world's a better place when economics is fairly boring... The more boring the better.","The key thing about me is that I'm really not very interesting.","I've never enjoyed sleep as much until I got the 'Today' job. There is something about early sleep that's much better than late sleep. I feel myself going to sleep; I don't just plonk my head on the pillow. It's a sort of winding-down thing.","What is so striking about Liberia is that in a place where there is so much to be done, I have never seen so many people with nothing to do.","For industry to settle in a country, you first need electricity; for electricity, you need some trained workers; for trained workers, you need some schools; for schools you need some money; for money, you need some industry.","Interestingly, human irrationality is a hot topic in economics at the moment. Behavioural economics it's called, on the cusp of economics and psychology.","Put simply, behavioural economics argues that human beings' decision-taking is guided by the evolutionary baggage which we bring with us to the present day. Evolution has made us rational to a point, but not perfectly so. It has given us emotions, for example, which programme us to override our rational brain and act more instinctively.","Personally, I don't see old economics and behavioural economics as opposed. It is useful to assume people are rational as a good approximation to their long term behaviour, but it would be unwise not to think how in practice their behaviour may deviate from that simplifying assumption.","But beginners to the World Economics Forum have to understand there is no single Davos experience, and there is no single Davos community either. There are numerous tribes who interact only at a minimal level.","Some people harbour an awkward clash of feelings - homosexual attraction on the one hand and shame or embarrassment about that attraction on the other. It is well known that the mind struggles to sustain conflicting views.","All socio-political phenomena in the U.K. come laden with the baggage of a class-based theory or two attached to them. In the case of gay Tories, there is one particularly silly variant of the category, which asserts that gayness is bred in public schools and thus fits with Conservatism like hand in glove.","I've always been scared of advertising folk. I've met them at parties and I've been to their offices and I've always found them intimidatingly cool. At one company I visited, they held their meetings in a caravan that had somehow been installed in the place, a rather more exotic place to gather than the typical BBC glass box.","Even the 'Today' programme involves a balance between the worthy-but-heavy items with the worthless-but-entertainingly-light ones.","Once we are fed, heated, housed and healthy, our extra consumption inevitably has an element of luxury about it. And once luxury enters the scene, the practicalities are in trouble, as women who wear expensive stiletto heels can testify.","But sometimes it's good to dare yourself to do the unthinkable. And rather than stand in front of an audience with no clothes on, I decided to have a go at stand-up comedy.","Now I can broadcast to an audience of several million people on the 'Today' programme. I can talk about the day's news. But on radio, believe it or not, we have notes and scripts. And while we might ad lib the odd wryly amusing asides, they come at the frequency of a suburban bus. About one every 90 minutes.","Being funny, it turns out, is like being a bank. It's a confidence trick. As long as everyone believes in you, you are fine.","The fact that radio is so hopeless at delivering data makes it an uncluttered medium, offering the basic story without the detailed trappings. But it does mean that if data is important, radio is probably not your place.","As it happens, I have personally been something of an enthusiast for the London Olympic games, mainly on the grounds a) that a bit of wasteland will be made nice and b) that it tends to make everybody happy that their country should be the centre of world attention for a couple of weeks in their life.","I rarely come away from presenting the 'Today' programme without some sense of regret. There is always some question that I should have asked, or some point that I should have made. This is annoying but not surprising. Perfection is hard to achieve in a three-hour live programme.","Even though disciplined sleeping habits and the adrenalin of live radio ensures that we are very awake while on duty, there is evidence of a phenomenon called circadian desynchronosis which causes one's brain to function slowly at those times of day when it thinks it should be asleep, regardless how wide awake the body is.","It is no wonder that bank capital is regulated. When borrowing and lending is profitable, it is tempting for banks to scale up their operations and to borrow and lend too much in relation to their capital, in effect reducing the effectiveness of the potential capital cushion.","We escaped the last big bursting of a bubble - the dotcom bubble - with a relatively light U.S. recession. On that occasion, the world economy found its way back on track fairly quickly.","Interest rate cuts have an effect in stimulating an economy by directly or indirectly making someone, somewhere, spend more than they otherwise would. That extra spending increases demand and ensures that we all carry on with work to do, without us having to slash our prices or our wrists.","In principle, there are only three main components of spending that much matter to monetary policy: consumer spending, business investment and exports and trade.","My instinct is to assume that we consumers are an inconsistent bunch. We like competition if it delivers low prices, but grumble if it delivers the bad news that prices need to go up.","We Brits print banknotes out in Debden in Essex, and have contracted it out to the private sector. Here in the U.S. it is a government operation right in the heart of Washington next door to the Holocaust Museum.","We all know that Americans love their statistics - in sport, obviously. And in finance too.","Black Friday is not another bad hair day in Wall Street. It's the term used by American retailers to describe the day after the Thanksgiving Holiday, seen as the semi-official start of Christmas shopping season.","For years, we've grown dependant on American consumers as the world's spenders of last resort. They've kept Europe out of recession, allowed China to industrialise, and prevented global deflation. But at the same time, they've not been looking after their own futures."],"Evan Esar":["Definition of Statistics: The science of producing unreliable facts from reliable figures.","Zoo: An excellent place to study the habits of human beings.","A signature always reveals a man's character - and sometimes even his name.","Hope is tomorrow's veneer over today's disappointment.","Housework is what a woman does that nobody notices unless she hasn't done it.","A hamburger by any other name costs twice as much.","The mint makes it first, it is up to you to make it last.","Definition of a Statistician: A man who believes figures don't lie, but admits than under analysis some of them won't stand up either.","Character is what you have left when you've lost everything you can lose.","The girl with a future avoids a man with a past.","A husband is like a fire - he goes out when unattended.","America believes in education: the average professor earns more money in a year than a professional athlete earns in a whole week."],"Evan G. Galbraith":["The State Department desperately needs to be vigorously harnessed. It has too big a role to play in the formulation of foreign policy, and foreign policy is too important to be left up to foreign service officers.","There's something about the Foreign Service that takes the guts out of people."],"Evan Glodell":["I am a mechanical techie. I can build things with my hands.","I developed a group of friends around me that were all as crazy as I was about wanting to make films.","I don't have any ambitions as an actor. I felt very uncomfortable doing it. The first take every day I'd open my mouth and no words would come out. I'd do a couple of takes and eventually I could run the lines.","Young men are crazy strange emotional beings.","I had a friend in high school who badly wanted to make movies and would recruit me as an actor. It was always so much fun. I decided, I'm going to go to Hollywood and make movies, which is a thought I'd never had before.","If the movies that I'm going to make anyway go mainstream, that would be the coolest thing ever. But I have set up a plan that I've been working on for a long time.","I hope I don't have to act in one of my own projects again.","But I always see myself as the filmmaker. I wonder if everybody else sees me more as an actor.","It was a hobby I got into a long time ago, hacking cameras. I was able to make my own using different lenses.","When things aren't working out for people, the end of the world seems like an easy way to wipe the slate clean.","I was writing short films and I was going through this really, really, really terrible end of a relationship that I didn't want to be going through. It was too much for me to process and all of a sudden I had this idea for my first feature film and I knew right away I had to start writing it.","I went to engineering school, which I thought was what I wanted to do, for about two weeks. We had an orientation class and we met this guy where he worked and stuff and it was cool, but I was like, 'There is no way this is going to be my life.'","I'm from Wisconsin; well, that's where I went to school from, like, sixth grade till I graduated high school.","I'm just gonna make movies the best I can, do the festival thing or whatever can come. I plan on working with a lot of the same guys over and over again. I hope the majority of us can stick together."],"Evan Goldberg":["I don't fully understand my wife's emotions - and I'm supposed to write an excellent female character and unravel the secret of women?","The thrill of doing visual effects doesn't exist.","I don't read good reviews. I like to know what percentages are going on. When Sony sends out something saying that people are liking the movie, I like to know that, but I don't actually sit and read the good stuff.","I just want to keep going for broke, making bigger and bigger things like 'Lord of the Rings' until they kick me out of Hollywood. I just want to do the biggest thing I can.","I was the - my trendsetting moment was my bar mitzvah had the first, like, temporary tattoo guy.","Growing up in Vancouver, it's not like growing up, you know, in Middle America or the middle of Canada or something. It's a very movie town.","I went to a Christian all-boys' college one time to pick up my buddies so we could go play baseball, and I just remember walking through the halls, and there's all these crucified Jesuses. It's scary.","I actually barely ever go on the Internet.","The hardcore fanbase of nerds that live on the Internet are not nearly as powerful as I thought they were. They really, really aren't. They also flip-flop like mad.","I'm not an Internet person that reads behind-the-scenes stuff. I see a trailer, and if it looks good, then I go. That's that.","'Lincoln' was OK; I thought it was a rock-solid eight out of 10, but it shouldn't win all the awards.","'The Hangover' was, like, solid. I laughed a bit, you know. Seven out of 10, maybe. But I made it 32 minutes into 'Hangover 2' before I walked out.","In America it's all, 'I'm gonna make something of myself, leave my tiny town and go to L.A!' Canadians are like, 'I'm gonna make something of myself, go to L.A., and then come right back again to hang out with my buddies!'","The theater remains relevant because of 3D. It makes it an event. You go there, 400 people put on their glasses, and it's just fun.","I can't wait for them to convert old movies to 3D. I am 100% confident I want them to convert 'Terminator 2' to 3D more than I want anything in the world.","All my cousins are almost old enough to start seeing my movies. I'm going to have some 'splainin' to do.","Everyone knows that in Hollywood, when you're hot, you've got to run with it. Because eventually they kick you out.","As a director, you can't stop a guy if he thinks something's hysterical, because if you do, then he'll get depressed because he thinks he didn't come up with a good joke. So if a guy's going on some run and it's killing him, and he thinks it's hilarious, you gotta do enough so that he thinks you can use it in the movie.","In the pie chart of my brain growing up, there's a huge slice for 'Ghostbusters.'"],"Evan Hunter":["A detective sees death in all the various forms at least five times a week.","I know that all cops are not sterling characters. But you have to have someone to root for. I balance it with rotten cops who will take a bribe, who will beat somebody up.","I would certainly never suggest that any lesbian should be ashamed of her sexual preference.","Readers are what it's all about, aren't they? If not, why am I writing?","It seemed to me... that the only valid people to deal with crime were cops, and I would like to make the lead character, rather than a single person, a squad of cops.","Depending on what I'm working on, I come to the writing desk with entirely different mindsets. When I change form one to the other, it's as if another writer is on the scene.","I have a book coming out in September, for example, where the plot concerns counterfeiting, and I had to do a lot of research on that. Or on any legal matters, for example, I have to do a lot of research online.","It's a matter of style. The Evan Hunter style and the Ed McBain style are very, very different.","I never take ideas from the headlines. I feel that if a story is good enough, a real story that is, then it's already been covered by the media, and if it's not good enough, why would I want to bother with it?","I wanted to be an artist. I was studying art. I wanted to be a great painter. When I went into the Navy, there wasn't much to draw at sea. So I began writing, and I began reading a lot.","I enjoy what I do every minute of the day, even when the going gets tough. When I first began writing, I used to work at a desk in the bedroom, of a small development house. My three sons all under the age of 3 would come running in and out of the room every minute.","I've never been a cop nor hope to be a cop, thanks.","I try to keep all my novels in print. Sometimes publishers don't agree with me as to their worth.","I would like to win the Pulitzer Prize. I would like to win the Nobel Prize. I would like to win a Tony award for the Broadway musical I'm now working on. Aside from these, my aspirations are modest ones.","I began using pseudonyms early in my career, when I was being paid a quarter a cent a word for my work, and when I had to write a lot to earn a living. Sometimes I had three or four stories in a single magazine without the editor knowing they were all by me.","Changing writing styles is like an actor taking on a different part."],"Evan McMullin":["Trump has never sacrificed anything for this country, and in fact, he has attacked people who have. It just makes me sick to my stomach when I see him attacking the mother of a fallen hero or John McCain. It just makes me sick to my stomach that this guy thinks he's prepared to be commander-in-chief.","It's never too late to do the right thing, and America deserves much better than either Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton can offer us. I humbly offer myself as a leader who can give millions of disaffected Americans a conservative choice for president.","Let me just say that I'm the only candidate in this race now that has any firsthand experience fighting terrorism. And both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, I think, have proven in different ways that they're unprepared for that challenge.","I spent over ten years in the Central Intelligence Agency as an undercover operations officer serving overseas after 9/11 where I carried out covert operations against al-Qaeda and other terrorist groups, as well as other countries who are 'hostile to liberty,' as I like to say.","Donald Trump, despite his campaign promises, this is not a guy who is going to be willing to send executive power that belongs to the legislative branch back to the legislative branch. I mean, Donald Trump is going to try to amass and consolidate power, given that he's an authoritarian.","If neither Hillary Clinton nor Donald Trump nor I are able to win 270 in the electoral college... then it will go the House of Representatives.","I believe Donald Trump is a bona fide authoritarian. I am deeply concerned that if he were president of the United States, he would act accordingly.","Hillary Clinton is a corrupt career politician who has recklessly handled classified information in an attempt to avoid accountability and put American lives at risk, including those of my former colleagues. She fails the basic tests of judgment and ethics any candidate for president must meet.","Donald Trump is already losing badly to Hillary Clinton. He is a weak candidate, and he's performing that way.","Donald Trump appeals to the worst fears of Americans at a time we need unity, not division. Republicans are deeply divided by a man who is perilously close to gaining the most powerful position in the world, and many rightly see him as a real threat to our Republic.","Donald Trump is defeating himself. He is ensuring that Hillary Clinton is elected. I think they would both be absolutely terrible.","As a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, I believe in traditional marriage between a man and a woman, but I respect the decision of the Court, and I think it's time to move on.","I am unknown because I've avoided the limelight so that I could serve. In the case of Donald Trump, he has avoided service so that he could seek the limelight.","Trump is not going to win the presidency because he himself is a weak, weak candidate.","I'm for whatever it takes to secure our border with Mexico.","We know that we can defeat Islamist terrorism without violating our ideals; indeed, we must. These ideals, these American ideals.","I think Utahns - and I won't speak for all Utahns - but my sense is that they have real issues with Donald Trump's lack of decency, with his bigotry, the way he's divided this country. That's not the Utahn way. I think they have issues with his attacks on religious minorities.","On Hillary Clinton's side, she believes she's unaccountable to the American people. She favors these old ideas about government, these - these centralized, top down solutions from Washington that keep insiders in the know and give them influence, but regular Americans have no voice.","As far as Gary Johnson is concerned, he is not a credible person on foreign policy. We need somebody like that. He doesn't understand religious liberty. I have some other concerns about his suitability and reliability in, you know, for the presidency. I just don't think he's a credible option.","As far as a wall is concerned, the experts actually say that in some places a wall is necessary, in other places a double wall is necessary, and in other places that a wall wouldn't help. So I'm for whatever it takes to secure our border with Mexico. We've got to do it. I'm for then enforcing our laws.","I spent over 10 years in the Central Intelligence Agency, serving overseas, serving in the Middle East. And let me tell you, if you're a terrorist and you want to come to the United States, the worst possible way to do it is as a refugee. You'll go through a year and a half to two years of vetting.","On the matter - on the issue of life, it's life. So I actually would pursue appointment, court appointments that would overturn Roe v. Wade.","I was a case officer, otherwise known as an operations officer. My role was to go out and convince Al Qaeda operatives to instead work with us as well as to convince people and officials in foreign governments to work on behalf of the U.S. government secretly.","We need to get serious about defeating ISIS; we just aren't serious about it yet. I would be very serious about getting it done. I know how to do it. We need to take the fight to them on the battlefield in a more serious way.","I do believe that power needs to be returned to the states. I think that we've got way too much power in Washington. This is where I'm focused: way too much power in Washington.","I'm a gun owner and strong supporter of the Second Amendment.","The idea that Donald Trump is a conservative is a complete farce. He is a conman who pretends to be a conservative.","If there is anyone who should not be trusted with regard to intelligence, it is Donald Trump, both in the literal sense and with regard to our intelligence services. He shouldn't have access to these briefings.","Donald Trump himself has financial ties to oligarchs in Russia who are close to Putin.","I am an originalist, to begin with. So, I am a constitutional conservative. I believe that the Constitution enshrines some universal ideals that make our country strong and that are consistent with truth, and so that's the basic thing.","There are lots of different ideas, lots of different opinions about the First Amendment Defense Act and what it should be. There were a lot of different forms of it while I was on the Hill. But I would say that I agree that the decision on gay marriage does mean that we need to take some steps to defend religious liberty.","My church, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, puts Jesus Christ at the focal point. It's the focus of everything. What I really hope is that people of faith in this country can come together in this election to ensure we elect a president who's going to do what's required to protect this basic principle of our country.","I think the U.S. leaders should do more to support our Israeli allies and the Palestinians to find peace.","Obviously, having served in wars myself, I'm eager to do everything possible to avoid them, but our military capability vis-a-vis a country like Iran is a major source of leverage in any negotiation that we should never, ever give up.","I will never turn down a good plate of hummus or falafel or shawarma. I just never will. You know, what I really loved in Israel was that at the time, at least, I could buy so many fruits and vegetables there for very inexpensive prices.","Democracies don't fight each other. Terrorists don't tend to come from places where they feel like they have recourse in a political system."],"Evan Osnos":["Once I became interested in China, I flew to Beijing in 1996 to spend half a year studying Mandarin. The city stunned me.","China's Communist Party is wary of independent-minded movements.","There's a national ambition, a collective, in a sense, political ambition, which I think is the thing we see from far away. That's the fact that China's building roads and airports and extending its reaches out into the East China Sea and the South China Sea, and in a way that's putting it into some tension with its neighbors.","Vladimir Putin was awarded an advanced degree by the St. Petersburg Mining Institute with the help of a dissertation that, as two Brookings researchers discovered, included sixteen stolen pages - and, remarkably, not a single set of quotation marks.","Living abroad has heightened my interest in how foreigners regard the strange places we encounter.","To Confucius, harmony was consensus, not conformity. It required loyal opposition.","Beijing has a glut of charming and traditional or brash and luxurious places to stay.","The devotion that young Chinese feel to the Internet is driven by deep factors ranging from youth unemployment and income inequality to political repression and the demographic imbalance between men and women.","Donald Trump has a mantra of despair, of loss. He says we don't have victories anymore. We used to have victories, but we don't. And he says the American dream is dead.","When I lived in Beijing in 1996, it was a horizontal city. If you wanted to go out for a burger, if you wanted to really treat yourself, you went to this place called the Jianguo Hotel. The architect had proudly described it as a perfect replica of a Holiday Inn that he had seen in Palo Alto, California.","Deng Xiaoping made a calculation. He bet on demographics. What he knew was that China had this enormous population of young, underemployed people, people who he could move from the farms to the coast and put them to work in factories, and that would be the lifeblood of China's economy.","China no longer has an ideology that makes any sense to them, but what they do have is great pride in the Chinese nation.","When I moved to Beijing in 2005 to write, I was accustomed to hearing the story of China's transformation told in vast, sweeping strokes - involving one fifth of humanity and great pivots of politics and economics.","By 1979, Chinese people were poorer, on average, than North Koreans. I mean, your average per-capita income in China that year was one third of sub-Saharan Africa's.","The Central Propaganda Department is the highest-ranking censorship agency in China. And it has control over everything from the appointment of newspaper editors to university professors to the way that films are cut and distributed.","Being in a Chinese coal mine for 30 years is like an epic novel. It's tragic.","I've been amazed at how fast and herd-like opinions in the United States are.","There's a deep underlying unpredictability to life that is thrilling. In China, my wife would say you go out to buy toilet paper, and you come back, and something interesting or revealing or funny happened on the way.","I can tell you, going out to buy toilet paper in the U.S. is a completely predictable experience.","There's a tradition in the history of dissent in authoritarian countries of a certain kind of dissident, and their form of dissent is to live their lives as normally as possible.","There's a reason the Chinese government is very concerned about Ai Weiwei. It's because he has all of these ingredients in his life that allow him to attract enormous attention across a very broad spectrum of the population.","On some level, there's a limit to what the government really worries about when it comes to a guy like Ai Weiwei, who's talking to a limited audience of people. He's talking to people who more or less already agree with him.","Usually when you interview somebody for a number of hours, they'll say something that is self-aggrandizing or is a manipulation of the facts.","I spent years overseas. I spent 11 years abroad.","It's worth being clear - you know, I think that the ideas that somebody like Richard Spencer endorses and that other members of the self-identified white nationalist groups endorse - those ideas really are repellent to most people.","Immigration, of course, in New Hampshire is - it's not something that you see every day. It's not like talking about it in Texas, where people have a much more explicit sense of it.","If you go back all the way to the 1920s, filmmakers in Hollywood changed the identity of villains from German to Russian.","There was a docudrama that was made, called 'The Death Of A Princess,' which was about a true story in Saudi Arabia. It was about a public execution for adultery. And when the movie was aired on British television, the Saudi government threatened to cut off oil exports and to cut off diplomatic relations.","I think there's a tendency, and it's an understandable tendency, to imagine that China makes decisions out of a grand strategy. The reality is that I think China today is operating, most of all, based on its domestic needs.","If you're going to have a book published in China, that means that you're going to be subject to in-house censorship at the publisher, and then also, of course, the government has an apparatus that is in charge of making sure that ideas that are considered disruptive or overly critical, that those don't get onto bookstore shelves.","Chinese readers are buying books in translation, particularly non-fiction about China, in large numbers.","The problem is that in order to publish a book in mainland China, you have to agree to be subject to censorship. That's the nature of the system. I don't challenge that system on its face. It's their system. But as an author, I have a choice to make whether I'll participate or I won't.","If you're trying to write about what the Chinese people are talking about, you can sometimes get a distorted picture if you go online and look at the conversation on social media.","China believes that it has the rightful claim to a vast portion of the South China Sea, which is claimed by other countries.","Seventy years after China emerged from the Second World War, the greatest threat facing the nation's leadership is not imperialism but skepticism.","If the economy can only provide a diminishing political dividend, Chinese leaders will encourage their people to feel pride and vigor in other ways.","When I was a student there in the mid-1990s, they had just created the weekend; depth and individuality were slowly returning after the austere, colorless low of the 1970s. When I returned to live in China from 2005 to 2013, the country was building everything anew.","Disclosure and transparency are the currency of the Internet, and they are at odds with authoritarianism.","China doesn't have a single leader. It has - a first among equals is the president, and his name will probably be Xi Jinping, almost certainly.","The United States, of course, in the late 19th century was extraordinarily corrupt.","More than four decades after Nixon met Mao, the relationship between the U.S. and China has reached a pivotal moment. To date, even as China has become more powerful and present in our lives, Americans have generally found it to be an unsatisfying 'enemy.'","The U.S. must differentiate between controversial assertions of power, like those in the South China Sea, and fair reflections of China's growing contribution to the world, such as the new banks.","Analysts, scholars, business people, diplomats, and journalists involved with China spend so much time questioning one another's biases and loyalties that they have even settled on two opposing categories: 'panda huggers' versus 'panda sluggers.'","Political prodigies are rare in a nation that grooms top leaders through decades of Communist Party road-testing and pageantry. And because Chairman Mao's cult of personality led the country into extremism, the Party spent the next three decades engineering its politicians to be as indistinguishable as possible.","In China, inaugurations are frequent affairs, though they have nothing to do with presidents. A news cycle rarely passes without some fanfare over the inaugural ride on a new subway line or the inaugural trip across an unusually large bridge.","I didn't expect to find much visible trace of the American war in Vietnam. The Vietnamese are too hard-bitten to dwell on it, and they've sanded away all but the outcroppings of history - the museums, the memorials.","A generation ago, American war planners made the mistake of believing that short-term Communist sympathies would unite China and Vietnam. We were wrong, and it tragically misshaped our policy in Vietnam.","'419 scams,' named for a clause from the Nigerian penal code, are such a part of the white noise of the digital age that we no longer notice them.","As a student in Beijing in 1996, I sometimes marveled at the sheer obscurity of the movies that somehow made it onto pirated discs in China.","When Richard Nixon came to Beijing in the winter of 1972, China was still in the throes of the Cultural Revolution, so it had a limited array of entertainment to provide.","The subject of human rights in China confounds absolute pronouncements.","In the final years of his life, when former Communist Party Chief Zhao Ziyang lived under house arrest, in Beijing, his aging friends resorted to donning white doctors' coats in order to slip past the guards stationed outside his home.","The Beijing government avidly asserts its control over matters of reincarnation as a way of securing the loyalty and political complexion of influential Tibetan figures.","At the age of eighty, the Dalai Lama has begun to discuss a range of prospects for the future disposition of his soul. Traditionally, after he dies, a search party of senior monks would set out to locate his new incarnation, who is most often a boy toddler, who goes on to be trained as a monk and a leader.","When the British-Malaysian photographer Ian Teh first worked in China, more than a decade ago, he rendered it as a nation of people in Technicolor.","If one is going to plagiarize, it pays to be in politics, where the expectation for remorse and the likelihood of punishment are minimal.","The only real mystery in the stories of political plagiarism is its durability in an age of Turnitin and other scanning software that can protect an author from his own mistakes, intentional or otherwise.","Young Chinese, who have grown up in an age of prosperity and stability, are typically the most passionate defenders of the Chinese political and economic way.","For my book, 'Age of Ambition,' I spent time documenting, among other things, the trials of young Chinese strivers who are bombarded by pressures unlike those that their parents faced.","For much of their history, life for most people in China was arduous and circumscribed - and people travelled as little as they could.","In 1975, the collapse of a cascade of Chinese dams during a flood killed a hundred and seventy-one thousand people, but the event is rarely discussed, and the names of the victims are largely unrecorded today.","When Libya was in turmoil in 2011, the Chinese public was surprised to discover that more than thirty thousand of their countrymen were living there, most of them working on Chinese-run oil projects.","In my fifth year in Beijing, I moved into a one-story brick house beside the Confucius Temple, a seven-hundred-year-old shrine to China's most important philosopher.","Confucius, who was born in the sixth century B.C., traditionally had a stature in China akin to that of Socrates in the West.","Confucius - or Kongzi, which means Master Kong - was not born to power, but his idiosyncrasies and ideas made him the Zelig of the Chinese classics.","In 2007, as a condition for hosting the Olympics in Beijing, the Chinese government removed restrictions barring Beijing-based journalists from leaving the capital without prior written permission.","For years, China expected foreign companies not to publicly voice their complaints about hacking or intellectual-property violations in order to protect their broader interests in the country.","China is so central to our economic lives that journalists have had no choice but to engage China with greater technical analysis and precision.","I started working as a reporter in Washington on October 1, 2013, the day the government stopped working.","For years, American officials visiting China marvelled at how Chinese leaders could push through infrastructure projects and sweeping legislative changes without the complications of opposition and the niceties of voting.","To my surprise, the more I searched about Qi Xiangfu, the more I found of a life lived partly online. He once wrote a short memoir in which he described himself in the third person, with the formality usually reserved for China's most famous writers.","Fact-checking can wreak havoc on Chinese political mythology.","Lei Feng is reported to have died in a freak accident in 1962 - struck by a falling telephone pole.","The fastest way to get around the southern Chinese city of Foshan is on the back of a motorcycle-for-hire.","By the Nineties, so many people were moonlighting and creating their own professional identities that China generated a brisk new business in the printing of business cards.","Walking, it turns out, is a sublime way to get to know people in China. They're used to meeting strangers on the road. Many here understand what it feels like to walk a long way.","Valuing the road over the goal was a Taoist goal in itself.","For all that we can see from the road in China, there is a lot that we cannot see. We miss what's behind the trees, the cover-ups, the darker side of things - the ingredients that so often drive a reporting trip.","Christianity is permitted under China's constitution, and the government has long supported a network of official Christian churches.","In a city that worships the new and the sleek, the street market at Da Jing Road is willfully out of step. It is a splendid jumble of centuries, full of sizzling pot stickers and bleating cell phones, pungent rice wine and bullfrogs as plump as softballs.","The Da Jing street market is little more than a few narrow intersections, barely six blocks long. But for a visitor, it is a living, breathing education in Shanghai cuisine, a style distinguished by its thick savory sauces spiked with sugar and soy sauce.","Like most markets, Da Jing is most alive just after dawn, when the elementary-school children in their uniforms and bright red kerchiefs set off through narrow streets, marking the start of another frenzied day of commerce.","Although Shanghai is on the sea, it long lacked the prosperity that Hong Kong enjoyed, so while Hong Kong became known for its exotic ocean creatures, Shanghai built its diet around more commonplace river and sea fish.","By tradition, Beijing is a city of walls, sheltering its intrigues and ambitions behind a series of concentric barriers from the Great Wall down to courtyard homes that draw sunlight only from the gardens at their core.","We binge on instant knowledge, but we are learning the hazards, and readers are warier than they used to be of nanosecond-interpretations of Supreme Court decisions.","In Beijing, the joke among hacks is that, after the drive in from the airport, you are ready to write a column; after a month, you feel the stirrings of an idea-book; but after a year, you struggle to write anything at all, because you've finally discovered just how much you don't know.","When you live in Beijing for a while, you gain a finely tuned understanding of air.","In Beijing, we talk about air purifiers the way that teenage boys talk about cars.","In Chinese, there are an impressive number of ways to describe saying nothing at all.","Over the centuries, Chinese bureaucrats perfected the dark arts of emptiness to such an extent that when they deliver speeches these days, they often recite verbatim speeches that they have previously delivered, with the sparest of adjustments.","It can take the uninitiated a minute to realize that 'Gangnam Style' is satire.","Living in Beijing, writing about politically sensitive things now and then, you get used to the idea that somebody, somewhere, might be watching. But it is usually an abstract threat."],"Evan Parker":["I think the whole question of meaning in music is difficult enough even if you hear me playing live right now in the same room! What I mean and what you take from it may be two quite different things anyway.","It's not like, I don't know, if Madonna has a new record out, then everybody from Bangkok to Birmingham knows what its called and can buy it the same week. But our stuff is not in that mass market.","There's an institution here called the National Sound Archive, and there's a character who works there, Paul Wilson. He takes a very special interest in the history of the music and advised Martin Davidson of the existence of these tapes.","I think it's a great document of John Stevens' originality. At that time he was already much more fully formed in his conception than I was. I was sort of struggling to keep up, and sometimes it's pretty obvious.","Actually John, Paul Rutherford, and Trevor Watts, and several other rather well known English jazz musicians had got their training by joining the Air Force, which was a pretty standard way for people to get some kind of musical education in those days.","So in the sense that we were all dealing with that freer approach, yes, it was certainly one of the first contacts, perhaps the first contact, when Peter came that summer. So it's a very pivotal moment that is documented there.","Those early steps are very important in understanding the evolution. But in themselves, maybe now you need the later records to understand the significance of the earlier records!","The argument we always used to use was that keeping records in the catalog was good for people that were coming new to the music, but I think that was talking over a ten year or fifteen year time span.","I think the solo playing, the decision to start playing solo, came out of having discovered what lay behind the doors that that technique opened for me.","I think the voice does that perfectly adequately without being imitated by other instruments.","So I'm looking to the saxophone as a resource which has its own unique set of possibilities. I'm looking to exploit them and develop them and have the fullest range of possibilities of the saxophone be known.","I've been to the studio several times, and it's not that I'm not happy with what I've got, but each time I come away, I feel that I've learned something that I want to work on.","But I think the record will actually come from tapes that are not yet recorded.","A kind of synthesis, but with some elements that perhaps you wouldn't have expected in advance. I always like that when that happens, when something comes that is more than the sum of the parts.","You know, the whole philosophy of ad hoc combinations has its strengths and its weaknesses.","To speak about notation as the only way that you can guarantee structure of course is already very suspect.","Certain kinds of speed, flow, intensity, density of attacks, density of interaction... Music that concentrates on those qualities is, I think, easier achieved by free improvisation between people sharing a common attitude, a common language.","In a certain sense, aspects of my solo playing were developed in order to test the theory about how long particular elements could be, as parts of so-called free improvisations.","There are many of these apparent philosophical paradoxes or contradictions which don't concern me anymore.","Improvisation is a compositional method.","If I think about the way I was drawn into the music, it was much more by recordings than by live performances."],"Evan Peters":["There's something that's sexy about a guy who has the strength to kill somebody, but is also vulnerable enough to be in love. It's just those two sides - like, I don't know why, but women for some reason aren't attracted to normal guys, like, guys who are in between.","A lot of people don't know that I'm really a silly guy. I don't take anything seriously. It takes a lot of energy for me to take something seriously.","I guess creepy comes natural to me - I hate to say that.","Just thinking about that, if that were to really happen, if an alien were to come down and really abduct you, how terrifying and how earth-shattering would that be? Your whole world is just destroyed. God is destroyed. It's kind of a fascinating thing to think about.","I think it's harder to go from comedy to drama than from drama to comedy. Seeing you dramatic all the time, they crave to see you being silly or funny. But, seeing you in comedy all the time, it's hard to see that person go be serious, for some reason.","If you get an audition and you're out of work, you just say, 'I've gotta go on this.'","I would love to do comedy. I think I'm funny and that comedy is my strong suit, at least in real life. I have yet to prove myself in the movies, but I'd love to get the opportunity to do that.","It all started in Michigan. My dad got a job in Michigan, so we all moved up there from St. Louis. I kind of hung out in the summer and had nothing to do, so I sort of got into acting. And then I was going to Grand Blanc High, doing the acting thing and hoping it would pan out.","Jessica Lange is a sweetheart, the nicest lady in the world. She has a Poodle named Jack.","I used to look at horror movies as being really real and it would totally freak me out and give me nightmares. Now I watch and think, 'whoa how'd they do that?'","But I love Halloween, and I love that feeling: the cold air, the spooky dangers lurking around the corner.","I'm trying to learn classical piano, Mozart and Beethoven and stuff. I took lessons when I was younger and now I sort of sight read the music and play it by ear. It's fun. It takes up a lot of time. I practice a couple of hours a day, but I find it soothing.","I like to watch comedies; the most dramatic that I used to get was 'Forrest Gump.'","And I love Jennifer Lawrence. She's a total fox. And such a good actress. It's ridiculous.","I think you get less takes on TV than in movies.","I grew up in St. Louis, Missouri. I lived in Grand Blanc, Michigan for a year and that's when I got involved in acting and took classes there. A manager who saw me at the agency I was at in Michigan wanted me to come out to L.A.","I'm not the best actor I can be, so I'm just working on it. I'm not the quickest reader in the world but when I get an acting book I can read it in two days.","Well, television is grueling. The hours are grueling, it's hard work, and there's a lot of pressure to get it done without a lot of rehearsal time.","'American Horror' in particular is a really crazy show. We have crazy crap happening to us on that show.","I actually put peanut butter on my bagel. I really like peanut butter and I like to ruin the bagel. You know what's even crazier that I do sometimes? I do cinnamon raisin bagels with peanut butter. It is really, really out there."],"Evan Rachel Wood":["I am trying to be a good person. I am trying to be myself, and if nobody likes me for me, that is their problem.","I have a very large shoebox overflowing with lyrics I've been writing and collecting since my teen years and into my late 20s, with lyrics from all walks of my life. Darkness, being in love, being heartbroken, finding yourself... and lyrics that I've been sitting on for, like, seven years, that I haven't done anything with.","The biggest lessons I've learned in life have probably come from a bad situation, from an angry situation, even if I wasn't the one who was angry.","I've struggled with gender norms my whole life, always feeling like I wasn't black-and-white; I was in this gray area, and gray areas really scare people because you can't define them.","My first love was singing. It was the first thing that really felt like it was a part of me. It's just in my blood. And acting came sort of out of singing because I did a lot of musical theater.","I've made my own music, and the way I've always described it is Peggy Lee with an electric guitar, or Billie Holiday with some PJ Harvey in there.","Anyone who says you can't do anything with short hair is wrong! Every day, my style turns into something new, and there are so many different ways you can wear it.","If I'm going to do anything extreme, I want it to have consequences.","I was always into very androgynous things. Guys, girls... I'm into androgyny in general.","We all just kinda did everything we thought we were supposed to do and girls dated the guys they were supposed to and did things with the guys they were supposed to.","The secret lives of politicians are always shady. People need to accept the fact that their leaders aren't perfect. No one is.","Singing makes me so happy and feeds my soul so much that I almost wouldn't want it to get tainted and become this work thing.","I was a real tomboy for most of my life. Then I went through a really girlie period, then through a goth phase. I was so obsessed with my hair and makeup, and I was having so much fun as a teenager playing with my look.","Just look at the messages today's media are sending everybody, from TV and commercials to actors and singers. Kids are just drowning in that 24-7 and it's getting really bad.","Sometimes I forget that I am even watching myself, realizing that's me. It's like you almost become a fan yourself: You are just this normal person watching this show, and then you realize that it's your show. It's weird sometimes.","I'm constantly changing, I'm constantly growing. I think I'm a little controversial... I just try and keep some mystery, so hopefully people can't really put their finger on it.","I hope to have a career like Jodie Foster, going from child to adult actress.","I'll never forget my 24th birthday when my tooth got punched out. And for a second I was like, it would be really hilarious if I sold it on eBay. But I can't, that's just too creepy. I don't think I can go there.","I've honestly fallen in love with a man and I've honestly fallen in love with a woman. I don't know how you label that, it's just how it is.","I'm a big karaoke fan and I also love Justin Bieber unashamedly.","You don't have to take yourself so seriously all the time.","All my life people have made fun of me because I was so skinny. They kind of made me feel bad about it sometimes. I worried that maybe people will think I am really anorexic.","I always feel like one of the guys and very unintimidated.","I don't remember a time when I wasn't acting. I have taken time off to figure out if it's what I really want to do, and it is. The only other job I'd want is to be a psychologist, as I spend most of my time analyzing people and emotions.","The Beatles mean so much to so many people, you know? Everybody has at least one song of The Beatles that's one of their favorite songs of all time.","I didn't really get a normal childhood.","I'm in love with London. English boys are great. I completely fell in love with it over there.","What's nice about acting is that you're not just left with yourself all the time, but you get to see the world through so many different people's eyes.","A script can just be a blueprint, and you've got to go in and build it and color it in and paint it.","I used to not even be able to order pizza on the phone because I was just so shy. I think that's why so much comes out on-screen: because that's my time to let go in a safe place. When you're doing that, it's all written down on paper, and it's total fiction.","I don't want to have another baby, but my little sister is adopted, and I was hoping that one day I could do that...There are so many possibilities.","I have a karaoke lounge in my house, complete with a tiki bar and hula-girl lamps and disco balls.","I hold music so close to my heart - to the point where I was always like, 'Well, if it's not Radiohead, I don't want to do it!'","Any child actor will tell you that you don't have a lot of the tools or the experience to combat a lot of the criticism or very adult situations being thrown at you.","One time, somebody said I look just like Evan Rachel Wood but hotter.","People who I've worked with are always like, 'Why aren't you doing comedy? You're funny!' because they've only seen the one side. I did do the comedy 'Whatever Works,' with Woody Allen and Larry David.","I have a black belt and used to compete when I was a kid! I did the Junior Olympics.","I am on Facebook, but it's mainly for friends and family, so it's not my real name. But I am on Twitter a lot. I resisted it for so long, but I love it because I get to connect with people I look up to - actors, comedians, and singers.","I love the smell of vanilla, but I didn't have perfumes growing up, so I wore vanilla extract.","I have facials, and I'll do microdermabrasion every now and then. But mostly, I eat right - you know, lots of greens - and I drink a lot of water. And I like to use a lot of natural stuff on my face. I don't like to over-product it. I actually wipe my makeup off with olive oil.","I'm a big Turner Classic Movies fanatic - I was really addicted for a while.","I met Bowie when I was 15 backstage at his 'Reality' tour and blacked out completely. I have no memory of the encounter except just looking into his different-colored eyes.","Throughout the entire time I was filming 'Thirteen,' I'd just lock myself in my room and listen to Garbage's first album. It was Shirley Manson, Nirvana and Radiohead who got me through everything. Also, Alanis Morissette and Tori Amos. They were so beautiful and strange, and they gave women permission to be angry and emotional, but also strong.","I do love when men wear cologne - if I get a hint of it, I want to move closer so I can smell it more.","I feel sexy when I'm doing what I love - like when I'm singing or performing or something - that's when I feel the most in control and in my element.","Dry shampoo is just really awesome because it'll keep your hair light, but it'll give it texture so that you can move it and style it, but it'll kind of just stay in place - so I really love dry shampoo on shorter hair.","I got the most surprising reaction was when I had bleached blonde hair with a black stripe at the bottom - all of the ends were black. That one got the most attention - good and bad.","Sometimes I think I still dress like a 13-year-old boy. It's not that I don't like feminine clothing: I just like a blend because it reflects who I am.","It took me a while to get to a place of feeling like fashion was an expression - something I could have fun with and an art form."],"Evan Ross":["I really just want to do the best at everything I do. I just want to have all the great people around me that I feel is family, as well as my friends, and I have an amazing girlfriend. I think having love in your life is most important.","The way I choose projects is based on what I think is most real and most interesting, not on what's paying the most money or what's most popular.","I always loved movies, especially watching some of my mom's films when I was younger, like 'Out of Darkness,' where she played a schizophrenic.","I have many creative outlets. I sing, I like music, I like art, I paint, I draw. I like buying art. I read a lot, too. I love books. And I'm working on a clothing line, too.","I've been making music for a long time, but I've been waiting to do it right, because I don't want people to think it's just a stepping stone in my career. A lot of actors go that route as a way of building their careers. I don't want it to be seen as that.","The one worry that I always have with TV is that it's such a long commitment. You sign on to be there for a good amount of time, and then you can't go and do films and things like that.","I feel like I've been very smart in the way that I carry myself and treat myself. I feel like my mom was a big part of that just because she's always let us make our own decisions, and we've known very much about the mistakes and the dangers already of whatever this Hollywood life may be."],"Evan Sayet":["What Democrats call 'nuanced', most people refer to as 'stupidity.'","Mitt Romney is a true Mormon. John Edwards and Bill Clinton are not real Mormons. It was not 'Brigham Young' they were chanting. It was 'Bring 'em young.'","Michelle Obama was asked when life begins. According to her it's when she and Barack take over the White House.","Jews were asked when life begins. For them it's when they finally graduate medical school.","Tony Rezko and Bill Ayers should lead the Democratic Party. They are the only Democrats with any convictions.","I am tired of angry feminists. I like my women happy, gregarious... and bathed.","Academics act like they are important, but when something is academic it is meaningless. People say, 'It's academic, now let's get work done.'","Barack Obama has raised tons of money. That is what he means by being green.","First there was racism. Then liberals created institutional racism and coded racism. You can only hear it with a dog whistle.","We are not imperialists. We don't even try to take over Canada. It would be easy, although it might take a rear guard action to guard Anne Murray.","Jews don't care about ancient rivalries. We worry about humidity in Miami.","Barack Obama says that we need to be humble toward terrorism. Yet he is the one we have been waiting for. That is humble?","At the Olympics in China, every color was represented... and that was just the drinking water."],"Evan Spiegel":["Talking with pictures and making memories is universally appealing.","If we take a step back and look at what Snapchat is, it all starts with the camera.","When we're in that kind of childish space, we're more genuine and feel more comfortable with our friends.","There is real value in sharing moments that don't live forever.","The fun thing about Snapchat is really the surprise and the joy that comes from learning how to use it.","People are going to copy your product if you build great stuff. Just because Yahoo has a search box doesn't make it Google.","I keep hearing about battery innovation, but it never makes it to my phone.","It's not about working harder; it's about working the system.","Typing and read receipts make a lot of sense for messaging. You write a letter, you put it in an envelope, you send it to a friend, and you want to know when they get it. It's like FedEx - they let you know when the package gets dropped off.","The social marketing teams of big companies will always figure out a way to advertise on Snapchat. I'd like to create a space for people who have a lot of talent but not a lot of reach.","We've never been anti-permanence. We just belief deletion should be the default.","It's important to be thoughtful and mindful about the things you say to other people.","We no longer have to capture the 'real world' and recreate it online. We simply live and communicate at the same time.","Five years ago, we came to the realization that the camera can be used for more than capturing memories. We showed it can be used for talking. The dream for us is expanding the camera and what it can do for your life. It has capabilities beyond making memories.","Online one day, you log in, and you realise, 'This is not me.' Everything you're posting, you're doing it in the context of everything you've posted before. Let's delete everything, save the stuff that's important, and then you only have to organise the one per cent that's worth keeping.","Conforming happens so naturally that we can forget how powerful it is. But the thing that makes us human are those times we listen to the whispers of our soul and allow ourselves to be pulled in another direction.","We believe that the next generation of powerful mobile companies have a deep understanding of the world as a unified whole, where digital and analog experiences affect each other rather than transporting analog experiences into the digital realm.","We're kind of looking at a future where people acknowledge the hybridization of digital and analog, and appreciate and understand that they both affect each other.","It's no surprise companies that quickly grow in value attract those who may want to also profit from the hard work of others.","I think diversity is a challenge everywhere.","More people are watching college football on Snapchat than they are on television.","Somewhere along the way, when we were building social media products, we forgot the reason we like to communicate with our friends is because it's fun.","Snapchat changed that perception of deleting something as bad. Online, typically you delete something if it's bad or if it's really embarrassing.","What Snapchat said was if we try to model conversations as they occur, they're largely ephemeral. We may try to write down and save the really special moments, but by and large, we just try to let everything go. We remember it, but we don't try to save it.","Social media is about friending someone so they'll invite you to a party or get you a job. If that's the work, Snapchat is the playground.","I'd like to create a space for people who have a lot of talent but not a lot of reach.","I snap with my mom. It was a great way for me to see my dog when I was in college. We send selfies, too.","Snapchat really has to do with the way photographs have changed. Historically, photos have always been used to save really important memories: major life moments. But today... pictures are being used for talking.","Generally speaking, the people who come to work at Snapchat believe in personal growth. It's part of why Snapchat's stories are ephemeral, because you will be a different person tomorrow.","It would be better for everyone if we deleted everything by default and saved the things that are important to us.","TheIinternet is a timeless void - you put something in there, and it's there forever and loses a lot of context.","I'm not a great manager; I try to be a great leader. And for me, that's been going through a process of not how to be a great CEO but how to be a great Evan, and that's really been the challenge.","People started conceiving of their friends as networking tools, like, 'Friend me so you can be friends with someone else,' or, 'The more people you know, the more networked you are.' But we see real value in having a fun conversation with your friends.","It seems odd that at the beginning of the Internet, everyone decided everything should stick around forever.","I am a young, white, educated male. I got really, really lucky. And life isn't fair.","For Snapchat, the closer we can get to 'I want to talk to you' - that emotion of wanting to see you and then seeing you - the better and better our product and our view of the world will be.","The essence of conversation is not which media format we choose to talk to each other with, so we don't differentiate between snaps and chats. It's just someone wanting to talk to you.","I don't want to disrupt anything. We never conceive of our products as disruptive - we don't look at something and say, 'Let's disrupt that.' It's always about how we can evolve this and make this better.","The feed was probably the biggest innovation in social media of late. But the interesting thing about a feed is that the more content you consume, the farther in time you go.","In the future, we'd like to support upcoming artists, people that are trying to be actors.","I think, with any new product that's difficult to understand, there are always lots of questions and criticism. I think we have all the right criticism. We're just going to keep executing on what we believe.","We don't want to own people's photos. We want to help them communicate with friends in whatever way makes them happiest.","Technology businesses in general are susceptible to hacking. That's why you have to work really, really, really hard with law enforcement, with security experts, internal and external groups, to make sure you're paying attention and addressing security concerns.","If I had a ringtone, it would probably be Neil Diamond.","I feel like I'm finally learning how to use Twitter, and Tweetbot has been a huge part of that. The interface is awesome, and it lets me easily manage two accounts at once.","I text nonstop, and I love emoji. I'm also on the phone quite a bit for work - probably more than 10 calls per day.","We are not advertising ourselves as a secure platform. It's a communication platform. It's not our job to police the world or Snapchat of jerks.","Cars bring me sheer joy.","Ephemeral should be the default.","The intent to preserve and capture something is very different from the urge to share, but they had become intertwined.","Creating a representation of yourself for the Internet stopped making sense when we were all on phones and connected everywhere.","Traditional social media, in the view of our company, has become a bit repetitive. It doesn't feel very good to be marketed to by your friends. Snapchat is different because it says, look, friends aren't valuable to you just because they can get you into a cool party.","Having been bullied growing up, it's something that's really near and dear to my heart. You probably won't have many friends on Snapchat if you're being a jerk.","There's this weird thing that happens when you contribute something to a static profile. You have to worry about how this new content fits in with your online persona that's supposed to be you. It's uncomfortable and unfortunate.","We never saw Google+ Circles or Facebook Lists as reflective of the way our friendships play out.","In tech in particular, everyone is so serious all the time and has these grand visions.","When we look at social media, we really look at it on a continuum, and the continuum is from accumulation to instant expression.","I just try really hard to be me, and sometimes that means I'm unfiltered. I try to give people myself because I think making a great product is being in touch with how you feel about things and being able to express things. I really hope I can stay in touch with how I feel about things and I'm able to express that.","One of the things I'm trying to get better at is apologizing when I make mistakes. That's been a big priority of mine.","Someone will always have an opinion about you. Whatever you do won't ever be enough. So find something important to you. Find something that you love.","We built our business on creativity, and we're going to have to go through an education process for the next five years to explain to people how our users and that creativity creates value."],"Evan Thomas":["American boys should not be seen dying on the nightly news. Wars should be over in three days or less, or before Congress invokes the War Powers Resolution.","Victory must be assured in advance. And the American public must be all for it from the outset.","Wars should be over in three days or less... and the American people must be all for it from the outset.","Rush Limbaugh is good for the party. Drive it all the way down, take it down as low as it can go, make complete fools of themselves, because it's always darkest before the dawn, and then maybe a moderate can come in and rescue them."],"Evan Williams":["People are fans of Dunkin' Donuts. They have a relationship with the company, they go there every day. Dunkin' Donuts is using Twitter to communicate with those people. There are people who are finding value in that. There's thousands of people, I don't know how many thousands now, following Dunkin' Donuts.","I like to think of the world as a sort of a casino, except the house doesn't have the advantage. If you're smart, you have an advantage. It behooves you to place a lot of bets.","Twitter isn't a social network, it's an information network.","When I meet with the founders of a new company, my advice is almost always, 'Do fewer things.' It's true of partnerships, marketing opportunities, anything that's taking up your time. The vast majority of things are distractions, and very few really matter to your success.","Every major communication tool on the Internet has spam and abuse problems. All email services, blogging services and social networks have to dedicate a significant amount of resources and time to fighting abuse and protecting their users.","The things that keep nagging at you are the ones worth exploring.","Where you are defines what you're interested in.","After high school, I enrolled at the University of Nebraska at Lincoln, but I stayed only a year and a half. I felt college was a waste of time; I wanted to start working.","I had a blog for many years. Once you develop your readership on your blog, and you can put something out there or direct traffic or get attention - it's like a super power.","I mistrust anyone... if they're saying, 'Well, that market wants this,' and you're not part of that market.","I've done a lot of stupid things, but in most cases I can't complain about the outcomes.","My strong belief - in being in blogging before Twitter - is that in trying to create more information out there, in trying to create the democratization of media in general, is that the more voices there are out there then the likelihood is that the truth bubbles up to the top.","I suspect there's a lot of validity to the premise that big companies aren't going to attract entrepreneurial talent.","I'm not a big-company guy. I need freedom and control.","The promoted tweet is a real tweet that a company may have sent out that they want more distribution for. They will buy key words for it. If people are looking for something related, it will show up.","Twitter is a very easy way to keep in touch.","Most of the great businesses of our time have experimented. Like Google.","'What is Twitter?' has always been a tough question to answer.","Blogging and traditional media work together. Twitter complements traditional media.","Twitter was designed to be this system that you just scan for information that's important or useful to you and then walk away, and if you wanna take a break you take a break.","The only reason Twitter itself would be a fad is if someone comes along and does it better.","I used to tweet about the most mundane things - like 'I just bought a soya latte' - but now I try and make it a bit more interesting.","My life has been a series of well-orchestrated accidents; I've always suffered from hallucinogenic optimism.","I was broke for more than 10 years. I remember staying up all night one night at my first company and looking in couch cushions the next morning for some change to buy coffee.","There's something about just hanging around when it comes to success on the Internet.","What the Internet is great at is building networks.","Anything I've done that really worked happened because, either by sheer will or a lack of options, I was incredibly focused on one problem.","Blogging got the concept of personal publishing, but it didn't really take advantage of the network.","Google started out when the dot-com boom was happening. It grew under the radar of big companies that were competing in but basically ignoring search. Then they were able to really invest during the bust for a long time.","Every time you start a company - and I've started five or six - you have the opportunity to screw up in whole new ways.","I tried to be a ski bum when I stepped away from Twitter, and I wasn't a very good skier.","People want to do good things, they just need a prod sometimes, and what Twitter and other technologies that connect people are showing us is that if you make it a little easier for people then you will enable them to do what they want to do, to help people out, to form groups and do good.","Traditional news is often full of mistakes, but I think that people are getting more sophisticated in knowing what to trust and what not to trust.","I think there's few cases in history where the C.E.O. steps down and is also the founder and reports to someone and that works.","My brother was the consummate Nebraska boy - the football star who went to the university, was president of his fraternity, hunted with my dad all the time.","In the best cases, Twitter makes people smarter and faster and more efficient.","While GeoCities isn't cool, it isn't a bad thing. It did a great thing - enabled great people to instantly publish to the Web.","'Vanity pages,' is somewhat of a derogatory term; personal pages are still the heart of blogging, but now there are more topic-oriented blogs. It's really about personal expression, and that's just gotten bigger and broader.","A key element of Web blogs is the community element. Most blogs are not self-contained; they are highly dependent on linking to each other.","I believe that companies that are independent are more competitive, ultimately.","I think Twitter will be a fundamental part of how people interact with their government.","I've always had a tendency to be much more optimistic about people than I should be. I'd like to be a little shrewder.","I subscribe to about 200 blogs. I look for insights and good writing, and I look to get smarter.","Unfortunately, 'climate' has become a dirty word - obviously in politics, but even to some degree in my world, in venture capital. People hesitate if they see something that's purported to be green. That's not a reason to invest for many people.","If you look at the Internet, the vast majority of start-ups are not successful. But the ones that are, are very very successful. So you can't point to the unsuccessful ones and say, 'There's no hope for this field.' It's just that they had the wrong idea or they had bad execution."],"Evander Holyfield":["Well, when I think of steroids I think of an image. You have the advantage over someone, which is a form of cheating. I guess it wouldn't be right unless it was legal for everybody. Reason it's not legal for everybody is because it can hurt people seriously.","People who make the choice to study, work hard or do whatever they endeavor is to give it the max on themselves to reach to the top level. And you have the people who get envy and jealous, yet are not willing to put that work in, and they want to get the same praise.","It is not the size of a man but the size of his heart that matters.","I'm just one woman away, my mother, from being the same as Mike Tyson. I would've ended up like him if my mama had not been so tough and strong. A lot of people, including Mike, don't know I came from the ghetto. They think I'm too nice and proper. But that's the way my mama raised me - to look people in the eye and respect them.","If you don't take no chances, then you're not a performer. Performers always take chances. You go see a singer, they'll hit the high note. They'll hit that note, they're not afraid, they're gonna exaggerate the fact and make me enjoy it, make me say, 'Wow, I wish I could do that!'","When at a young age you learn to face your fears, that makes the difference between people being champions and people not being champions.","The word of God steadies me. He says your trials and tribulations make you who you are. So you can see my whole story in the way I endured and overcame some testing experiences.","We lived in a real rough place but my mother kept me straight.","A sight game is that I am hurt, but I aim to make you believe I am not even hurt, and with this confidence appearing on my face, I don't panic, otherwise your opponent will know that you are hurt. That's the whole art game in boxing.","I beat Larry Holmes and George Foreman. I whupped Mike Tyson twice. I had my ear chewed off and spat on the ground in front of me. I've seen everything it is possible to see in boxing. I know this business better than anyone. So I live and die by my own decisions.","Deep down, I reckon the sweetest moment will come when it's finally all over. When, at last, I know that I can stop fighting. Of course it'll also be a little sad. The sweetest moments, y'know, always come with just a little sadness.","I got three whippings a day from my mama.","As far as working out, I know exactly what I'm doing.","Sugar leaves you stranded; I make sure I have the proper amount of protein before I work out.","No. I probably do better not being in politics. They have too much control over you when you are in politics.","Well, number one I like dancing. Number two I knew it would be challenging because I had never done this type of dance before. I always wanted to and I happened to have the courage to go out there and give it my best shot.","Well, of course a boxing match is hard because boxing isn't set for you to do good. You have to force your will upon someone, but dancing you don't have to force your will. It should be a lot easier because if I make a mistake I don't get hit.","My goal is to be the undisputed Heavyweight Champion of the World.","The game's been good to me and I hope I've been good to the game. I'm 50 years old and I've pretty much did everything that I wanted to do in boxing.","The big guys choose who they want to fight and they think about history: 'how many times I defended my title.' They try to break a record: 'how long I was there.' But if you look at the pedigree, who they fought, ain't nobody gonna give them credit for it because they fought a lot of people with no experience.","That's the biggest problem with boxing in the United States. They do not promote it like they used to, when it used to be Howard Cosell and they showed it on 'Wide World of Sports.' Everybody knew all the fighters. Everybody was looking forward to the year when the Olympics came on.","They don't show Olympic boxing on TV in prime time. They haven't done that since 1988. In 1992, they showed one: Oscar De La Hoya. In 1996, they didn't show it. In 2000, they didn't show it. In 2004, they didn't show it. In 2008, they did not even mention boxing at all. You would think the United States didn't have a boxing team in 2008.","I came up poor. My mother only had a fourth-grade education. My dad didn't have any education at all. But they were very structured. They worked hard. You know, they didn't complain. They didn't murmur. And they believe in the Christ.","The main thing about Bruce Lee is that, he was a little guy. And you know, his quickness, his aggressiveness, his explosive power, you have to be a great athlete to have all these, his body, his look, you know, all these things have to do with discipline and structure. He was able to go against the biggest guy, regardless of who he was.","Madison Square Garden, November 1984. I don't recall taking too much fear into the ring. I knew I could fight. But I got a big shock. They put me in with this rough, tough veteran called Lionel Byarm. He tested me to the limit. But I fought my heart out and, in the end, I prevailed. The story of my life, in my very first fight.","Fighters find it hard to give up doing what they do best - fighting for a living.","From what I hear is happening, young Indian boxers have started to do well on the world stage and started to gain the attention of the general audience."],"Evangeline Lilly":["Even if you're unhappy, just pretend that you're happy. Eventually, your smile will be contagious to yourself. I had to learn that. I used to think, 'I'm being fake,' but you know what? Better to be fake and happy than real and miserable.","If you can't sit in a cafe quietly and be ignored, how can you observe human nature and write a story?","Your mind and soul are the kings of your physique way more than any exercise you do.","I had my baby outside in a thunderstorm. It was really romantic.","I have battled clinical depression and have come out of the other side. I've been free of it for many years now. Finding the place in my own mind and heart to win that battle without using medication, finding the place within myself where I could be alive again, that was one of the biggest challenges I've faced.","Every woman is after a kind of classy image.","I am a classy dame.","I'm very proud of being a woman, and as a woman, I don't even like the word 'feminism' because when I hear that word, I associate it with women trying to pretend to be men, and I'm not interested in trying to pretend to be a man. I don't want to embrace manhood; I want to embrace my womanhood.","I just like short hair on women; I think it's cool.","In your 20s you can be pretty, but you don't accomplish real beauty until you find wisdom and depth.","The people on my mum's side of the family are atheist intellectuals who are ueber-proper. My dad's side of the family are missionaries who are more comfortable sitting around in sweatpants than they are in a five-star restaurant. But those two influences converged in my life.","I'm the kind of person who, if I were living in another time, if I had to pick any time, I would probably be a pioneer. I just love the simplicity of what it means to work hard with your hands - to eat and survive.","That's what happens in Hollywood. People are like, 'I want to hate you, because everyone else seems to love you.' But the reality is this: I'm a simple person who's not interested in attention and who just wants to go about her business.","I love getting older! I really believe that a woman doesn't reach her peak until her 40s.","When I was a little girl, I dreamed of being an elf.","In my world, I don't believe in forever promises. I don't think it's realistic.","My son is wonderful. He is amazing.","Saying 'no' is not hard for me; it's scarier for me to say 'yes.' I'm actually more afraid of commitment than of saying 'no.'","I'm good at looking good with weapons and stunts. But if you put a bull's eye in front of me and asked me to hit it, I'd say the chances of me hitting it are about one in a million!","There are some 'Star Treks' I love, and there are some I don't love.","To put it simply - you know, a lot of people believe that the benefit of this job is fame and fortune. I believe that you pay for the fortune through the fame. I don't buy into the notion that being famous is somehow a good thing, or an exciting thing, or a wonderful thing.","I'm a good Canadian girl. I miss all that good stuff. I miss tobogganing and I miss snowboarding, but I've also learned to surf and I've become a water baby which I used to be relatively terrified of the water and I kayak all the time now and I'm able to run year round on the beach which you can't obviously do in Canada.","I'm a very stubborn woman and I'm from a very stubborn family of headstrong women. I have sisters, so the women rule the coop in my house.","I used to cry myself to sleep wishing I was ugly because of the way men leered at and disrespected me.","I lived in grass huts in a jungle in the Philippines for three weeks with tribal people.","I don't want to shield kids from reality.","If you go back to, say, the Brothers Grimm or Roald Dahl, you see so much darkness in children's material.","My partner doesn't read. He's not illiterate - he just chooses not to read - and I love reading. I'm obsessed with reading.","My family didn't have a lot of money, and I'm grateful for that. Money is the longest route to happiness.","As a filmmaker, you have to understand the essence of the book and tell the story you want to see on the screen, and hopefully please yourself - because you can't possibly please everyone.","My favorite parts about 'The Battle of Five Armies' were the moments where you could clearly see that we were looking at New Zealand. That it wasn't done in post, it wasn't CGI, it was the beautiful, incredible creation of Mother Nature in all of her splendor.","A creative project is a moving target. You never end up where you start.","I'm very picky when it comes to men. I come across a man who I'm really attracted to about once every five years.","I love being outside - that's where I'm the happiest.","I think that being isolated from the Hollywood world of premieres and red carpet events was probably good for me because I could ease into those at will and by my own choice. But in other aspects, when it comes to fanfare, Hawaii is nuts and in L.A. they're all so jaded. They don't care.","I always wear something slightly masculine.","There are jobs to be created on both sides of the climate argument. Whether we are investing in oil or sun, coal or wind, gas or algae, the economy will be stimulated by the investment. The economy, unlike each of us, is not swayed by ideology.","If Americans could choose, would they choose to work on the infrastructure for cancer-causing oil power or would they choose to work on the infrastructure for health-reviving wind power?","I was fortunate enough to be one of those stories where I was scouted on the street by somebody and actually refused to go to the agency, and was approached on different occasions and finally kind of caved and said, 'OK, I'll try it and see what happens.'","A month and a half after my first audition, I won the role on 'Lost.'","I was a good student, I was good at soccer, I was vice president of the student council, I was a pretty girl.","I didn't grow up in a home that glorified Hollywood. We didn't watch TV. We didn't have a lot of magazines around.","I'm from Canada, and New Zealand feels like you took all the best bits of Canada and squished them onto a tiny island like Hawaii. I was absolutely blown away by the beauty of the South Island.","My heart is in helping people and in the less materialistic side of things, but there's the side of me that's more polished.","If I were to live in Africa, serving the poor, the number-one thing I'd miss wouldn't be running water or electricity - it would be style... being able to get dressed up and feel beautiful.","The world is full of opportunities, and I want to try as many as I possibly can.","Acting is something I appreciate, and I think it's been an amazing experience. But I'm not passionate about acting the way you probably should be to call yourself an actor.","When I got the job on 'Lost,' I was a broke university student living in the crappiest part of town, with a duct-taped back window on a broken-down car. I existed on peanut butter and tea.","I was a massive Tolkien fan. 'The Hobbit' was... my favorite book as a little girl, and the Silvan Elves were my favorite characters in the book.","I consider acting a day job - it's not my dream; it's not my be-all, end-all.","I don't watch TV. When people at my house try to talk about TV, I'm like, 'Ah, I have no idea what I'm talking about.'","There's nothing more frustrating than when fans use a nickname. That's like people you don't know using names from people that you're intimate with. Like if my mom has a nickname and a fan finds it out and starts using it, that's creepy.","One of the things that I miss about Canada is that even the strangers, you have an immediate rapport, there's just an understanding that we're all good people, let's be nice to each other. And Kiwis have that. I find the Kiwis have that.","I got the script for 'Real Steel.' I started reading and saw that it was about robot boxing, and I was immediately turned off. It's not my thing. But I continued on, and by the time I got to the end of the script, I had chicken skin and tears in my eyes. I thought, 'Man, we don't make movies like this anymore.'","'Real Steel' was this lovely little piece where I held a cup of coffee and talked to Hugh Jackman for three weeks. And that sounded kind of nice.","'The Squickerwonkers' was the story I wrote when I was on 'The Hobbit.' And I brought it to Comic-Con and sold out a thousand copies I had printed.","The difference in my body from pre-pregnancy to post-baby was night and day. I didn't have the strength, I didn't have the flexibility, I didn't have the stamina, I didn't have the mobility. I felt like I was handicapped.","I think I'm not always what I seem. Most people, when they get to know me, say, 'You know, when I first met you...' People initially think I'm a snob because I'm intensely private.","I definitely come down on the spiritual side. I think very few things in life happen by chance.","When I got old enough to date, I realized that Valentine's Day is just a commercial marketing scam to make men feel bad. So I let my boyfriends off the hook.","I would love to pretend I don't diet, but I work very hard. I stay active and eat very healthy. Anybody who says otherwise is either unhealthy or lying! I will admit that I'm addicted to sugar - licorice, Jujubees and jelly candies. And I actually love bran muffins!","It's so important for women to say to other women, 'I like myself how I am.' But it's hard because in your heart of hearts you are thinking, 'I don't really.' But you have to learn to say it. Imagine what a world it would be if people felt good about themselves the whole time.","We decided to have the baby at home because we wanted it to be a natural birth, and it turns out that it was 30 hours of natural. Eight hours of pushing - that's the part that men don't understand. Women go, 'Oh, dear, oh, dear God, eight hours of pushing?' And the men are like, 'Okay, eight hours of pushing.'","I don't like the idea of playing a one-dimensional character who is just fearless, strong, and killer and has instincts and just thrives in dangerous circumstances - that's really boring to me, and I don't think it represents what most women feel inside.","I have been a bit of a reluctant actress since the get-go, since the beginning of 'Lost.'","I haven't sat down and memorized the language of Elvish, and anyone who does that is crazy!","I've not worked with Martin Freeman. I've hung out with him, but I've not worked with him.","It's very difficult to play opposite nothing. I did it for, like, six years - I ran from an invisible smoke monster for most of my twenties.","I seem to be landing really great locations on a lot of my work. I hope that continues, knock on wood.","I'm an actress, but I'm not stupid.","If you're going to tell stories about life, you have to include a woman in your story.","I am five foot six, I am built of muscle and bone, and that is not very good for fashion, but it's who I am. Women who look good in fashion are six foot tall, don't have an ounce of muscle, and their legs are the size of my arm.","My son was three months old when I started filming 'The Hobbit,' and I was still breastfeeding.","Every other 16-year-old girl wanted to look at bridal magazines; I could not have been more bored with the notion.","I have an American son and an American partner, so marriage might logistically make sense at one point. My partner is a stay-at-home father, so if he wants to be on my health plan, or tax wise, or maybe on paper we want to have our I's dotted and our T's crossed, but emotionally, neither of us really feels the need for it.","I used to watch actors and say, 'You poor suckers, that job looks miserable.'","I actually find flying therapeutic.","I was brought up in a household where I was not allowed to take the Lord's name in vain.","Life is all about embracing each moment that is given to you.","What I wanted originally was six kids.","Life is magically beautiful. And it brings you what is perfect.","Peter Jackson has just really earned the right to be Tolkien's torchbearer on screen.","'The Hobbit' didn't include female characters at all and was a very linear story, a book for children, really.","I'm a pretty skeptical person, and I'm a realistic person.","People were fed up with reality shows about midgets getting married and weird Jerry Springer talk shows. There had been a real dry spell of intelligent family-oriented viewing: the type of program that Mom, Dad and the kids can all watch together. With 'Lost,' there are just so many characters for people to invest in.","In high school, people wanted to find the worst in me.","I say no to photographs. When people take my picture, I feel like they've taken a piece of me, and I can't get that back. It's soul-draining.","Somebody could take a picture of me from across the room, and I would feel like I wanted to rip their face off.","I've had to find my sanity.","I've been careful what I've put my name to.","I'm not a girl who needs to put on a whole face of make-up before I leave the house.","There are so many roles on TV that I don't covet. I see them, and I'm glad I don't have to play them.","I hated being a flight attendant. I did it for a month and then quit.","I never developed hard cartilage in my ears because I played with them since I was a baby. I can fold my ear entirely inside out, and I can put the whole thing inside itself.","I love to write. I write everything across the board - kids' stories and novels and scripts. I actually would like to give that a go; I'd like to try to be a writer.","'Why are we here?' 'What is our purpose? 'Is there an afterlife?' 'Is there a God?' 'Is it all about science?' Those are big questions, and usually, TV is a little scared to go there.","In every one of the 'Squickerwonker' books, we will explore a new Squickerwonker character and their vice and how their vice generally leads to their undoing.","I think I can allow myself one child - and from then on, I think I would have to adopt. It makes sense not to add to the population problem.","I'm allergic to Hawaii. Everything there makes me react in some way.","I think women in Hollywood who don't do Botox and plastic surgery are revered. I revere them... My plan is to never go there. I'm too vain to get plastic surgery because I don't like how it looks, and I want to look my best.","I do feel like I'm at ease in my own skin when I find an androgynous balance.","If you are not a clearly defined human being, it is very hard to define your image... What I've realized in my own journey in fashion is that I'm not that defined.","Motherhood is a joy! I have dreamed about being a mother since I was 12 years old, and there's nothing disappointing about it.","We're not going to protect the Earth the way we need to protect it if we don't stop making so many babies.","I love getting older!","I really believe that a woman doesn't reach her peak until her 40s.","I'm a bit of a pick-pocket on-set. If something is small enough to go in my pocket, and it will be neat memorabilia, it's gone.","On 'Ant-Man', I took a rubber stamp from the office of Hank Pym, who's played by Michael Douglas.","I dance around my living room to cheesy '80s aerobics music until I'm sweating really hard!","Walking is a very underestimated exercise in North America. It's all run hard, lift weights and push your body, but walking is wonderful for elongating the body and posture.","The reality is when you open a door, there is no sense in closing it - so I would never say, 'I'll never act again.' But it's definitely not my priority.","If one day a TV series comes into my head, and that is what I want to write, I'll write it. It just depends what story is in my brain at the time.","Around the time I graduated from high school, I decided better to underachieve and have friendship than to overachieve and be alone.","There are so many reasons why, for me, writing is superior to acting. One of them is anonymity. Writers can live relatively normal lives.","I just don't think that a lot of the time the messages we send kids prepare them for real life.","Wonder Woman was my favorite superhero as a little girl. I still have a huge girl crush on Wonder Woman; I think she's amazing.","I see kids and young adults walking the streets of L.A. with this enormous sense of entitlement, who seem to think that if they are basically good people and pay their bills, then the world will be good back to them. And I think life isn't always like that.","Believe me, there is nothing more rewarding than making Peter Jackson chuckle.","When I hear the words 'Women should be barefoot and pregnant and in the kitchen,' I think, 'What. A. Dream.' There are no negative connotations to it.","I love to dance. Don't get me started, because you will never get me to stop.","For a human audience, seeing things that are slightly more otherworldly and beyond human power is always really fun and exciting to watch.","I think of the 'Hobbit' films as being films for the family.","I don't want to just model. Anyone can do that. I've let myself be in magazines in the past without participating as much as I should have.","It would be amazing to play Sylvia Plath. She was so dark, and what came out of her writing was troubled and fierce. The dimensions, levels, layers and levels would be incredible to take on.","I am an opportunist. When opportunities come, and I see them serving my grander goals in life, I take them.","I've been astounded to discover how good to their teams and crew that Marvel are. They're so collaborative, so smart with their stories. They have rich, dynamic characters which are so much fun to play.","If I went for too long without writing, I would start to feel like something inside me was dying.","It is a very frustrating thing to be the face of a creative project and yet essentially have zero creative control over that project. Essentially, you're a pawn in the system.","I do love 'Star Wars,' although I'm not one of those crazy fans who knows everything about everyone.","It's a surprisingly sacrificial job being an actor.","When I act, I come away drained. When I write, I come away energized.","I'm a bit delusional, but every time I do a job, I think I'm retired.","I spent a lot of time in the clouds. Becoming a mother has really helped me put my feet on the ground and given me a very powerful sense of self and a powerful sense of priority in life.","After about five hours of pushing, my midwife and my birthing assistant said, 'You know, we have a few suggestions.' And I was like, 'Really? After five hours of pushing you have a few suggestions? You couldn't have told me five minutes in?'","When I was 14 years old, I was crazy about Dr. Seuss. I loved the words he made up, and I just thought, 'Well, if he can make up words, then I can make up words.'","By rights, I should be an out-of-work actress because I just don't want it as badly as some people want it.","I'm not a highly social person. I'm a highly productive person.","Diets are a fool's errand.","Everyone thinks they can cure stress by adding to their schedule, like going to yoga. Oh, great - one more thing to feel guilty about when you can't do it."],"Evangelista Torricelli":["Is it a surprise that into the vessel, in which the mercury has no inclination and no repugnance, not even the slightest, to being there, it should enter and should rise in a column high enough to make equilibrium with the weight of the external air which forces it up?","The Geometer has the special privilege to carry out, by abstraction, all constructions by means of the intellect. Who, then, would wish to prevent me from freely considering figures hanging on a balance imagined to be at an infinite distance beyond the confines of the world?","We have made many glass vessels... with tubes two cubits long. These were filled with mercury, the open end was closed with the finger, and the tubes were then inverted in a vessel where there was mercury.","Many have argued that a vacuum does not exist, others claim it exists only with difficulty in spite of the repugnance of nature; I know of no one who claims it easily exists without any resistance from nature."],"Evangelos Venizelos":["The country needs someone with experience and determination to make tough decisions. All the money aside, it is important that Greece restore its reputation.","The vast majority of Greeks accept the need for reform and want to keep our country inside the euro zone.","Without Greece, it is not possible to preserve the integrity of the European phenomenon.","We only have a Plan A. The acceptance and full implementation of the existing plan, the so-called Plan A, is the best solution for Greece, for the euro zone and also for creditors and holders.","Europe and the euro zone have no reason, rationally, to push Greece out of the euro. But this is a system in which many parties, many countries, many governments, many electorates participate and we could have events which, rationally, are not controllable.","I am the head of the Socialists, but the party is not my property.","Voters will decide how they want to be governed.","Everyone should respect the sovereignty of the EU countries.","Greece is a medium-sized country in Europe. Our debt accounts for only 2.5 percent of the total of all members of the euro zone.","Those who have a lot of money in Greece invest in housing abroad. It's all immoral. The Greek crisis is structural, but also political.","Protect those who protect you."],"Evanna Lynch":["Sometimes I'm stressed and I'm sick of things and I need to forget about them for a while, so in Harry Potter you're taken to this wonderful imaginary world where everything is so different.","They warned me, 'you're going to be doing the screen test with Daniel Radcliffe a week after the audition.' And then in the hair and make up department, he walked up behind and scared me. But you get used to him quickly because he tries to make you feel very welcome and at home.","It calmed me down to see that most of the time no-one gets the scene on the first take.","It was this feeling the whole time like I shouldn't be here among all these stars and professionals. I was trying to keep my distance because I wanted to watch everyone. But they want you to feel at home and be part of it, and it became normal very quickly.","One week I was in school and the next I'm at Leavesden Studios in Dumbledore's office reading scenes with Daniel Radcliffe. Weird. And terrifying for such a huge 'Harry Potter' fan.","People like her because she's like a breath of fresh air. Because in the fifth book it gets so dark and Harry's always cross and then every time Luna comes in all the tension goes and she makes you laugh because she's so funny and really honest. I don't know how much I'm like her, there are some similarities but I'm more determined than her.","While I was in London it was completely upside-down. I got a whole new life and it was a challenge to keep in touch with my life in Ireland, but it was great fun. Now though, I've been back home since November and gradually all connections with my HP life have been fading.","I got very carried away with my 'Harry Potter' life and we did have school but I didn't study. I just had fun.","It wasn't like a Maths test where I have to strain to get it right. I feel very close to Luna so acting her was just natural. And if I had got too nervous I'd have done terribly.","Sometimes, the other characters are too normal and then you start to be brought back to reality but then Luna shows up and she is just so funny and cool and honest and slightly mad and she's all that matters. She is 100% true. She puts on no shows, because she is so comfortable with herself.","Well just meeting J. K. Rowling was amazing because she created all this world. And all the fans, we all get so obsessed with it and then you met the one person who made it all up. It was just so amazing. And I was just so amazed that that she wrote this book and all of the films have happened.","My cats - I have Luna who's just had kittens recently and we called one of them Dumbledore. They're nice but they're not like their characters."],"Eve Arden":["'Widow' is a word I never thought would describe me, but I had to learn to deal with that.","The thing to do is to build a fortress within yourself.","Stole my first name from 'Evening in Paris' and the second from Elizabeth Arden.","So many people accept the negative. They are constantly blinded by that negative thing.","None of the characters I played was very close to me as a real person.","I don't have a Pollyana attitude toward life that claims everything is lovely.","I've always admired teachers for their patience and purpose in choosing their profession.","The better the teacher, the better the future of America.","I can't seem to say, 'You great big wonderful man, you,' without hamming it up somehow.","I'm finding writing very fascinating.","I knew my own mother had been in the theater for a while and had taught children, because she used to teach me the pieces that she taught them, but she did much more than that.","I've never cared for the character I generally played in films.","My friends will tell you that I'm a very mild person.","Everyone from Pullman porters to hostesses at swank New York parties will tell me they always watch 'Miss Brooks' on Friday night.","Our kids seldom even get to see a movie. When we go to a movie, it's an event - and we make it an event.","As for Hollywood children, their social life can get a little overboard, just like their parents can. Living in town, you attend so many functions.","In a sense, children who live on a farm become sophisticated, too - but about more important things.","I couldn't stand seeing myself on the screen.","In the theater, I could envision myself as wonderful because of the audience response to my lines.","I love making people laugh.","If I'm in a serious play, I often think to myself, 'I could make that line funny.'","I may not like the material, but I'm still a trouper.","You couldn't keep me out of the school plays, the song and dance skits.","I've worked with a lot of great, glamorous girls in movies and the theater. They would always give their last ounce to get where they wanted to be."],"Eve Arnold":["It is the photographer, not the camera, that is the instrument.","What drove me and kept me going over the decades? If I had to use a single word, it would be 'curiosity.'","I look for a sense of reality with everything I did. I didn't work in a studio, I didn't light anything. I found a way of working which pleased me because I didn't have to frighten people with heavy equipment. It was that little black box and me and £5 worth of film in my pocket or maybe it was only £2 in those days.","What do you hang on the walls of your mind?","I don't see anybody as either ordinary or extraordinary. I see them simply as people in front of my lens.","If a photographer cares about the people before the lens and is compassionate, much is given.","What you need to be a good photographer is an overwhelming curiosity and a good digestion. Sometimes you feel blessed with curiosity, sometimes you feel cursed with it.","If the chemistry is right between star and photographer and the geometry of the pictures pleases the star, often the two people end up with a long-term professional friendship during which they continue to work together and to produce highly personal images.","It doesn't matter if you use a box camera or you use a Leica; the important thing is what motivates you when you are photographing.","What I have tried to do is involve the people I was photographing... if they were willing to give, I was willing to photograph.","I want the subject to be in control. Because they will give me something I couldn't possibly know about them.","I find going back through things sometimes exhilarating because I find things I didn't know I had, and sometimes it's very off putting because there are things I never quite finished, and there's nothing at all to do about it now.","Lesson number one: Pay attention to the intrusion of the camera.","I had in mind a long career.","I came to photography by accident.","I have been poor and I wanted to document poverty; I had lost a child and I was obsessed with birth; I was interested in politics and I wanted to know how it affected our lives; I am a woman and I wanted to know about women.","Themes recur again and again in my work.","I love the idea I can go off with a single camera and a few rolls of film unencumbered... I was not interested in the illusion of reality, I wanted to get close to what was happening.","I realize that I had the best of serious picture journalism.","I realise that I had the best of serious picture journalism. There was an innocence in our approach, especially in the 1950s and 1960s when we naively believed that by holding a mirror up to the world we could help - no matter how little - to make people aware of the human condition.","It's hard for me to assess what I brought because each time you pick up a camera and point it at a person, you're trying to define that person so to talk generally is difficult because I have to think of a given image in order to conjure up what we're talking about.","What has changed is that when I photographed, most people that I photographed didn't have the right of refusal on their work. It would take a Marilyn Monroe at her height to be able to dictate that.","I can't hold a camera anymore.","You should never reveal your true age.","If you are careful with people, they will offer you part of themselves. That is the big secret.","Recording sessions were stimulating to photograph, because everything was in motion: the subject, the musicians, the technicians and the photographer. You needed fast reflexes to keep up with moving targets, and sensitivity and skill to get the pictures while keeping out of the performers' eyeline so as not to break their concentration."],"Eve Babitz":["I was sure that somewhere a grandiose carnival was going on in the sky, and I was missing it.","I've often noticed that there is a moment when a man develops enough confidence and ease in a relationship to bore you to death. Sometimes one hardly even notices it's happened, that moment, until some careless remark arouses one's suspicions.","I wasn't as used to the new dumb questions, so when men I had once thought of as wise daddies now asked me 'How do you write?' I did not try and spill red wine in their suede pants. I would just smile and say, 'On a typewriter in the mornings when there's nothing else to do.'","When I promise I'll do something, I do it. At least since I got sober.","I'm a mermaid now, half my body.","I knew just by reading this guy, Nathanael West, that he was probably one of those icky East Coast guys with glasses who got mad because when he came to L.A., all those starlets preferred producers or cowboys to him.","I've been in love with people and ideas in several cities and learned that the lovers I've loved and the ideas I've embraced depended on where I was, how cold it was, and what I had to do to be able to stand it.","People with brains went to New York, and people with faces came West.","From earliest childhood, I have rejoiced over the Santa Ana winds. I know those winds the way the Eskimos know their snows.","I looked like Brigitte Bardot, and I was Stravinsky's goddaughter.","Partner dancing is a cultured act.","I met Harrison Ford at Barney's Beanery. And I met Steve Martin at the bar at the Troubador. He said he wanted to be a stand-up comic. I thought that was the worst idea because he was so square, so Orange County.","By 1976, I was, like, Gonesville. I practically lived at the Troubador for several years. When Bette Midler was there for six weeks, I went every day for both shows. I sat there mesmerized. The only person who went as much as I did was Cher.","The only reason anything was off-white at the Chateau was because it had once been just plain white.","I was in love with Paul Butterfield.","Everybody steals my lines.","I posed as an album-cover designer and photographer... That I today have some album covers and photographs to show for myself is a monument to the attention-to-detail of my disguise.","I like handsome-devil artists the best.","'Dirty Dancing' is one of my favorite movies, and I was in love with Patrick Swayze for years, but I tried to stay out of his way and never to meet him because I knew if I did, he'd want to talk about yogurt or some weird dietary restriction or something.","Musicians are impossible."],"Eve Best":["When I left Oxford, I knew I wanted to act, but I was unsure how to go about it.","I would love to go and live in the mountains... and make jam.","I have never worn a watch. I did at 17 and it annoyed me.","Time is about the need to control. Let go of control and embrace what happens.","If a part terrifies me, that is definitely a reason to do it.","I haven't done the milestoney things - getting married, buying a house, having children.","I am so longing to be domestic,, cooking stew, gardening, hopefully having some children, painting, sitting still in one place.","I love the Old Vic so deeply, it's like a second home.","Changing my name was traumatic for me.","I don't read reviews. I find them very distracting, whether they're good or bad.","If you're a woman doing classic theater, the big roles are often destroyers. I've played Hedda Gabler, Lady Macbeth, some of the Chekhovian heroines, Electra, Phaedra - they're all powerful women, but they're forces of negativity.","When you are up close to an opera singer, hearing this incredible volume of noise coming from a human being - it's beyond belief.","There are so many huge roles in the theatre: if you've got the option to play Hedda Gabler on stage, why wouldn't you choose that over a three-line part in a Hollywood film as somebody's maid or somebody's wife or somebody's best friend?","I don't like, and I've never been very good at, close-up shots. As soon as you have the camera right there in front of you, it feels like you're in a different reality from the person you are acting with; you lose any real connection with them.","There's this funny thing with pilots that you have to sign the contract to do the whole job before you're even offered the part. And they make about a million pilots a year, but hardly any of them get turned into series."],"Eve Bunting":["I write at a desk. I have a room of my own where I can have my computer. I write in there, usually directly onto my computer. It used to be the room where my two sons used to sleep with the dog and the cat, but now it's all mine. It has pictures of art from my books on the walls.","Yes, I have two books that are about me: one of them I wrote, and the other one was written about me. One of my books, which is called 'Spying on Miss Muller,' is really about me even though it's a novel. My autobiography is called 'Once Upon a Time.'","Titles are very hard. Sometimes a title comes before I start to write the book, but often I finish the book, and I still don't have a title. I have to go through the book again, and then sometimes I hope a title jumps out at me from what I've written.","I write every day. I don't have a writing schedule. I write when I feel like it. Fortunately, I feel like it all the time. I am writing for hours. I do like to write in the morning. I start after breakfast, like 9 o'clock, and I'll write till lunch, about 1. And after lunch, I just have fun."],"Eve Ensler":["I wake up every day and I think, 'I'm breathing! It's a good day.'","I think the greatest illusion we have is that denial protects us. It's actually the biggest distortion and lie. In fact, staying asleep is what's killing us.","Why are women immobile? Because so many feel like they're waiting for someone to say, 'You're good, you're pretty, I give you permission.'","Unless men are active allies, we'll never end violence against women and girls.","Well, the tyranny of masculinity and the tyranny of patriarchy I think has been much more deadly to men than it has to women. It hasn't killed our hearts. It's killed men's hearts. It's silenced them; it's cut them off.","People are sad. People are broke. People are worried about money, people are worried that they're not enough and not amounting to anything and they don't feel good about themselves. People have rough times, and everybody's pretending it's not true, and we need to break that veneer.","I think when people begin to tell their stories, everything changes, because not only are you legitimised in the telling of your story and are you found, literally, like you matter, you exist in the telling of your story, but when you hear your story be told, you suddenly exist in community and with others.","Theater has an incredible capacity to move people to social change, to address issues, to inspire social revolution.","My dream is that people will find a way back home, into their bodies, to connect with the earth, to connect with each other, to connect with the poor, to connect with the broken, to connect with the needy, to connect with people calling out all around us, to connect with the beauty, poetry, the wildness.","Security isn't what I hunger for. I hunger for change. I hunger for connection.","People think that when you're connected with other people it's more painful. The opposite is true. When you're connected to the river you have despair, but you also have joy, and there's a flow in the river.","I would rate the fact that I get to be alive a big beautiful 10. Satisfaction with myself - work in progress.","I was a waitress for nine years, which I don't regret at all. It taught me about discipline. I was always writing; it took a long time to make a career of it.","Cancer essentially lives in us and becomes activated at some point, and then cells begin to psychotically divide. Initially, the cancer cell looks like other cells and the body invites it in.","If you are connected to your own internal being, it is very hard to be screwing and destroying and hurting another human being, because you'll be feeling what they're feeling. If you're separated, it's not a hard thing to do at all.","I think the world is always improving and always not improving. I think that both are simultaneously happening all the time.","I'm a feminist; I grew up with feminism, but I also think there's a way in which we need to shake things up so that we can push it further and in other directions.","The older you get, the more you are aware that everybody has a certain way of seeing things, which they have to honour.","When you destroy a population, once femicide happens, we're going to see the end of humanity, because I don't know how you sustain a future without vitalised women.","Dance has a transformative effect on bodily trauma.","I was born in Manhattan and grew up in Scarsdale. Scarsdale didn't work for me as a place at all.","I'm a nomad. I have a place in New York in the Flatiron District, and I have a place in Paris in Ile Saint-Louis, and I spend a lot of time in Congo.","I think all my work's been about how do women get back into our bodies; how do men get back. We're all disassociated.","I think violence against women in America has become ordinary - it's been made absolutely acceptable.","I've been involved in social activism my entire life, and I would argue that many people involved in social activist movements have done very little work on themselves.","Do I think it's great that we have a celebrity system where some people matter and some people don't? No. But do I think we'll always create icons and legends? Yeah, I probably do.","I'm in good shape. My cancer means I have lost a lot of organs and I'm a lot lighter. I have devoted myself to yoga and I'm doing handstands.","Since cancer, I feel like I have dreams rather than ambitions, visions rather than plans.","Before cancer, I was obviously disconnected. I had a tumor the size of a mango inside me and didn't do anything about it. It wasn't like I didn't know something was wrong.","When I wrote 'The Good Body,' I turned 40 and suddenly had this stomach. It seemed like the end of the world. Because I didn't value my body. I was constantly judging it, but I also didn't live in it.","One of the most radical things women can do is to love their body.","I try not to think about what people think of me. You can't, because then you get hung up in all the people who love you, and you've also got all the people who hate you, because of what you're doing.","I think that anytime you get clear about what your mission is or what your focus wants to be, things start to come together in your life.","I really want to help stop violence toward women.","The minute someone tells you you have cancer, it's kind of like you die. You really do die. It's like you get that you're mortal.","It's a weird thing about the truth: It protects you. What really makes you vulnerable is when you're lying because you're going to get caught. When you tell the truth, there's a strange relief that comes.","Whatever culture, whatever country, girls are taught to please others as opposed to pleasing themselves.","I grew up in a tradition where having ideas and contributing to the community and creating art that had an impact on the world mattered. That's part of the Jewish tradition.","Geography does not define you - love does.","When you listen to other women's stories you begin to understand your own better and you begin to find ways back through and with each other.","For many years now, I feel like my own body struggle has been linked and connected with women I meet in the world. I think we're in this together.","I think I've always had these two currents, equally strong, of wanting to change the world and make the world better and fight injustices and fight violence, and then being an artist, which is a very different strain.","I think theatre to some extent is always about telling stories, isn't it, and I think what I've learned is that freedom comes when you tell your story; freedom comes when you tell the truth."],"Eve Golden":["John Gilbert was perfectly willing to jump into talkies. He had as good a voice as Clark Gable. There was such a divide between the silent and talkies. There was no logic to who survived and who didn't.","I never took any writing classes or planned to write. But I was working as an advertising copywriter in the late '80s and thought, 'What a shame there has never been a decent book on Jean Harlow,' then thought, 'Why don't I write one myself?' being kind of an idiot and not having the slightest idea what I was getting myself into.","Anna Held's birthdate and hometown are a dark mystery, thanks to her own mythmaking."],"Eve Hewson":["I always wanted to go to Sundance.","There were times when I wondered if I was doing the right thing, studying when I could have been going to auditions.","I get called 'Memphis Eve,' but my first name is Eve. I know Memphis is in there somewhere, but on my passport I'm 'Eve Sunny Day Hewson.'","I don't get handed money - and I never will. I have to work!","In my family, I would never dare to think of being Paris Hilton! And to me, that doesn't look like a happy existence - it's just not who I am.","That's the thing about acting - you can't fake it.","No one knows who I am and no-one cares. I could jump in front of a camera man and he'd just tell me to get out of the way."],"Eve Jihan Jeffers":["My dream collaboration is with Lauryn Hill. Is that ever gonna' happen? Who knows! But there's still a lot I feel like musically I could do.","I listen to every thing, all kinds of stuff. I've been obsessed with the Nas and Damian Marley record, 'Distant Relatives.' I feel like a lot of people haven't heard it, and it's amazing.","I'm such a girly-girl! I don't know why people don't see that.","I'm still a tomboy at heart. In high school, I was the girl in the baggy jeans and Timberlands, but I was also at the hairdresser's every week.","I did not let people tell me what to do, and I never wanted to be a groupie.","I can't wait to have kids. I want so many. I want to adopt and have my own."],"Eve Myles":["With a play, for me, there's no time to sit back on it. You're living on your instincts. And every night there are subtle changes and adjustments, because what's in front of you is a living, breathing audience.","Let's be honest, L.A. is not a bad place to live. There are some crazy people there, but I tend to get on with them!","Every play should be 90 minutes. There would be so many more theatre-goers if plays were shorter.","As a jobbing actor, I never get a script and go 'I can't be bothered with this.' Life doesn't work like that. For a movie star, maybe, but for a jobbing actor, that doesn't happen.","My goal is to stay happy in my work and to do quality work.","A 'Torchwood' movie would be incredible. It would be sensational to have a beginning, a middle and an end in ninety minutes. A big walloping 'Torchwood' crunched into ninety minutes would be breathtaking."],"Eve Plumb":["I never wanted to do reunion shows for the sake of a reunion show. I've done all the 'Brady Bunch' stuff except for the Variety Show, but when a talk show wants us all to get together for their sake, it's not interesting to me.","I have a unique history. There's no way to ever separate what your life would have been like if you had taken a different path. You have to embrace what is yours, and if you don't like it, you have to decide to change it.","In the early days of picture-taking, the exposure shutter had to stay open for a long time, so you had to stay really still.","I don't consider my life to be boring at all. I consider my life to be massively fortunate.","People always brand me as this person who is anti-Brady, and I don't think that I ever have been, except that occasionally I would like to talk about something else that I'm doing.","I listen a lot. I think people have their own answers, and if you just listen to someone and agree with them, eventually they'll work it out for themselves.","I came to acting as a sort of fluke. I really enjoy it, but I think I'm different from the people who dreamed about it.","When I was six years old, a children's agent moved in next door to us, sent me out on a commercial audition, and I got the job."],"Eve":["God is my best friend. I talk to God every day. And no one can tell me how to talk to God - not no imam, not no priest, not no rabbi, no pastor.","Out of all the places in the world, Jamaica is my favorite place.","I'd rather make all my secrets public than have an image based on gossip. I'd rather put it out there myself and control it.","As far as style goes, I gravitate toward anything that is effortlessly chic. I don't wanna look like I'm trying too hard.","Reggae is my heart since I was a kid. I love Reggae music.","I'm completely obsessed with Sunday roast dinners. I think that it's the best thing to ever happen to life!","I am completely turning into my mom. Me, trying to be stern, is her. Or when I make silly voices. My mom always uses weird voices if she's talking to a kid or a dog. I'm the same person - completely my mother.","I'd rather experiment than follow the same formula. I'm a curious person. It's gotten me into trouble, but I say, 'Why not? Let's try it.'","I like to dabble in different things, but music is my first love. It connects to me in a way my side projects don't because it's so personal. I write the words. Music is like my diary. It's my therapy.","What surprised me most about fame is how unpleasant it can be. I used to think it was going to be so fun. I got excited about the parties. You don't anticipate friends being jealous of you and critics giving your music bad reviews. Media and rumors - that stuff hurts.","'Lip Lock' is a play on words. It sounds flirty and fun. Also, my lips are one of my favorite features. Also, it's like, literally locking the game down with my words because I'm a lyricist.","Coming from Ruff Ryders, there would be, like, 30 guys in the studio at once, and then me, trying to do my own thing.","I'm such a girly-girl! I don't know why people don't see that.","I'm still a tomboy at heart. In high school, I was the girl in the baggy jeans and Timberlands, but I was also at the hairdresser's every week.","I can't wait to have kids. I want so many. I want to adopt and have my own.","My dream collaboration is with Lauryn Hill. Is that ever gonna happen? Who knows!","I live in a neighborhood where there's a lot of West Indian culture, so it's nice.","I listen to everything - all kinds of stuff. I've been obsessed with the Nas and Damian Marley record, 'Distant Relatives.' I feel like a lot of people haven't heard it, and it's amazing.","I can't wait to have kids one day. Yeah. Definitely. That's the ultimate goal in life, for myself. I think that's the ultimate blessing.","Sticky toffee pudding is my favorite dessert in the U.K.","Originally, after 'Tambourine' came out, another record was supposed to come out, but I had issues with my record label at the time, which was Interscope. We couldn't agree on a record, so that took some time. I had to leave them and find a new label.","I always say, 'Hip-hop takes me everywhere.' It's crazy when I step onstage, and people might not speak much English, but they know every word to your songs. It's kind of freaky, but it's really cool.","I worship God. Religion and worship are two different things to me. Religion is by the book. I think too many people rely on the textbook: 'OK, it says to do this and it says to do that, so if I do this, this, and that, then I still can go out and do wrong because I did this, this, and that.'","I don't wanna be known as just a hip-hop artist. I wanna take it to a whole 'nother level.","I can't help who I am. I'm just doing what I feel like I should do in my heart. If I was walking around with Timbs and a hoodie on, people would see that that's not me.","When I got into high school and I was rapping, it was the attention I was loving. It was so hype.","I don't go anywhere without Elizabeth Arden Eight Hour Cream. On airplanes, I slather it on my face and lips - I know I look crazy, and I don't care!","I think I have had so many amazing moments in my life.","When I do music, I do it for me and my fans.","I just want to produce and create projects that I'm passionate about and I love."],"Evel Knievel":["I love the feeling of the fresh air on my face and the wind blowing through my hair.","I decided to fly through the air and live in the sunlight and enjoy life as much as I could.","Anybody can jump a motorcycle. The trouble begins when you try to land it.","Riding a motorcycle on today's highways, you have to ride in a very defensive manner. You have to be a good rider and you have to have both hands and both feet on the controls at all times.","I am a guy who is first of all a businessman. I'm not a stunt man. I'm not a daredevil. I'm - I'm an explorer.","There are a lot of myths about my injuries. They say I have broken every bone in my body. Not true. But I have broken 35 bones. I had surgery 14 times to pin and plate. I shattered my pelvis. I forget all of the things that have broke.","You are the master of your own ship, pal. There are lots of people who fall into troubled waters and don't have the guts or the knowledge or the ability to make it to shore. They have nobody to blame but themselves.","If you don't know about pain and trouble, you're in sad shape. They make you appreciate life.","Those extreme-sports kids today are good, but they have it easy. Try falling off of a motorcycle going 70 or 80 miles per hour on asphalt. Believe me, nothing equals it.","I don't have any problems in life, just situations.","You can't say you're going to jump the Grand Canyon and then jump some other canyon.","If you fall during your life, it doesn't matter. You're never a failure as long as you try to get up.","If I'm out trailriding, I have a favorite motorcycle. Riding on the road, I've got a favorite. If I'm jumping, I have a favorite, and if I'm racing, I have a favorite.","Kids come up to me all the time and say, 'Once I was going through a really bad time, and I saw you crash and get up, and it inspired me.'","Breaks your heart when your son doesn't love you.","You come to a point in your life when you really don't care what people think about you, you just care what you think about yourself.","I can't keep track of my hospital time. It all sort of blurs together.","The most important thing in life is, if you have a dream, I mean a real good dream, follow it.","In the old days they, the promoters, wanted more and more from me. They wanted me to jump or spill my blood and break my bones. Every time they wanted me to jump further, and further, and further. Hell, they thought my bike had wings.","I like to help kids, work with kids in detention homes. Don't tell a kid what's right and wrong. He knows what's right and wrong. Find out what his attitude and his aptitude are; try to help him where he wants to go.","If you look at the Bible almost everything that was predicted, maybe everything, has come to pass.","You'd think a guy who has broken 35 bones in his body would have a high pain threshold, but mine is pretty low. I got hit in the shin with a golf ball once, and it almost brought tears to my eyes. I've had broken bones that didn't hurt as bad.","When I hit that pavement at 70 or 80 mph those suits just ripped.","The Internal Revenue Service is more ruthless than the Gestapo. Abolish the IRS! Stamp out organized crime!","Unless we do things in this country to slow down our population, slow down our birth control, provide better water for people, provide power for people, we're gonna find out that the next wars are not going to be fought over diamonds, gold and political things.","When you're mad at someone, it's probably best not to break his arm with a baseball bat.","The finest compliment you can pay a man is that his word was as good as gold.","I did everything by the seat of my pants. That's why I got hurt so much.","I foresee the Chinese ruling the world. What are you going to do to stop it? No president of the United States will ever have enough power to stop the Chinese when they want to take over the world.","I recently have had a full hip replacement and a liver transplant, and I'm getting used to the medication.","I thought I was bulletproof or Superman there for a while. I thought I'd never run out of nerve. Never.","The Harley's got a little too much torque when it comes to jumping.","My life has been being a daredevil. I am Evel Knievel. I am a daredevil.","Titanic Thompson and Amarillo Slim would have run from a game with Marty Stanovich. Marty could really play, and he didn't cheat.","I've always been concerned about kids - not just my own three, but all kids - what kind of an image I'm providing for them, what kind of inspiration. I don't know now. Maybe I'm leading them down the path to self-destruction.","There's just no stopping me. I went through life big-bang-banda-boom-bada-boom.","I think if you have ability and talent in one way, you have it in all ways. I'm not a jack of all trades; I'm a master of many. I don't feel there is anything I can't do if I want to.","I created Evel Knievel, and then he sort of got away from me.","All my life people have been waiting around to watch me die.","But you come to a point in your life when you can't pull the trigger anymore.","Harley-Davidson is the finest company in the world.","I am a lucky, lucky person.","I guess I thought I was Elvis Presley but I'll tell ya something. All Elvis did was stand on a stage and play a guitar. He never fell off on that pavement at no 80 mph.","I know guys in my hometown that drive by feel and sound.","I know that I'm very lucky to be alive. For 35 or 40 years I've spilt my blood and broke my bones and spent years in hospitals.","I really think we should pass a law in every state, I don't care whether it takes the independence away from an old person or not. You shouldn't be driving a car if you're over the age of 80. Maybe even less than that.","I think I coulda landed on a dime. I really do.","I think these shows with the young kids doing these jumps, doing these fantastic back flips, I think they're absolutely great. They did what I never did.","I think through education, belief in God, and good engineering, our children become a lot better at what they're doing than we did, and that starts with the very first sign of life on the face of this earth.","I've been in a treatment center for drinkin'. I stayed for two days, then escaped.","My own judgment of how the world is gonna end is that there will be a country led by a madman that will build a nuclear bomb with so much force, so much power, that it will be dropped somewhere on the face of this earth and that the earth will lose its place.","My wife and I, we like to ride where there's not much traffic.","This is a year and a few months after the transplant. Before I had it my doctors told me that it would be the biggest thing that I ever had to face and believe me, when they take your liver out of ya and put another one in it's like replacing a football in your stomach.","Women are the root of all evil. I ought to know. I'm Evel.","You can be famous for a lot of things. You can be a Nobel-prize winner. You can be the fattest guy in the world.","People pay a million dollars to be recognized, but nobody cares about them. They cared about me because I did things other men were afraid to do. That's why my fans identified with me.","I always knew how to draw a crowd.","You know, I had a couple hundred jumps in my career, and I made most of them, but the ones they show over and over are the ones when I crashed.","I went through life big-bang-banda-boom-bada-boom.","Marty Stanovich was an honorable man.","I'm better than P. T. Barnum and Colonel Parker put together.","I don't know what in the world happened. I don't know if it was the power of the prayer or God himself, but it just reached out, either while I was driving or walking down the sidewalk or sleeping, and it just - the power of God in Jesus just grabbed me... All of a sudden, I just believed in Jesus Christ. I did, I believed in him!","I wish there was such a thing as reincarnation.","The saddest thing is when a guy is paying so much attention to the world and everything going by that he can't take the time for his own mother.","God made us. He's in charge of everything, right? If He didn't like us, why didn't he change us?","If there is a heaven, I don't know anything else I can do to get there - and neither do you.","I always wanted to live to about 70. I thought that'd be a good age.","A motorcycle coming down from 30 feet at 70 mph gives you a terrible jolt.","I want to be the first. If they'd let me go to the moon, I'd crawl all the way to Cape Kennedy just to do it. I'd like to go to the moon, but I don't want to be the second man to go there.","Prison was tough on me. I saw people in prison that made me ashamed I was a human being. Some make Qaddafi and Idi Amin look like Sunday-school teachers.","I went through high school, but I didn't graduate.","Sometimes I keep a car for only a week or two. I like the newest and the flashiest.","I am not, never have been, and never will be a politician. But I want to tell you the United States has always been proud of having the support of the United Kingdom, of keeping Britain in Europe. We need Britain in Europe.","I have my tombstone already. A tombstone company in the East gave it to me when I jumped Snake Canyon. My plot is in Montana.","I can still crack a safe with one hand tied behind my back. I'm not proud of it. But I was always against society.","It's easy to be famous today. People pay a million dollars to be recognized, but nobody cares about them. They cared about me because I did things other men were afraid to do. That's why my fans identified with me. They were mostly working-class.","My failures had a lot to do with my fame. I created Evel Knievel, and then he sort of got away from me.","I guess I'm like any other concerned father, except that nobody else's son guns a cycle over 17 pickups without holding on to the handlebars.","I play golf five days a week. I find that if I play seven days a week, I get stale.","I'm not only the best-known daredevil on the face of the earth, I'm the oldest.","My grandpa got me a set of Wilson clubs, Sam Snead models, when I was 12. Many years later, when I'd become well known, I got to know Sam, and we played a lot of golf together.","I learned one thing from jumping motorcycles that was of great value on the golf course, the putting green especially: Whatever you do, don't come up short.","Nothing's worse than a guy who loses fair and square and then whines about it.","You can't forbid children to do things that are available to them at every turn. God told Eve, 'Don't give the apple to Adam,' and look what happened. It's in our nature to want the things we see."],"Evelyn Ashford":["I was single-minded and I had tunnel vision. Now it's time for a change.","I take pride in everything I do. I don't want to be handed anything. I want to earn it.","I can feel the wind go by when I run. It feels good. It feels fast.","I can't run forever. I decided to go back to school for my degree, because I know now there's more to life than track.","Whatever muscles I have are the product of my own hard work and nothing else.","I want it all. Fame, fortune and all the commercials there are to do.","Now, I talk to athletes who answer questions with a 'yeah'. I realize I used to do that. Or they answer very quickly and you stand there trying to come up with another question to ask. I've seen both sides and it's been very educational.","I've noticed that since I've been pregnant I see babies everywhere. I love talking to them. I never used to really like kids that much. I guess it comes out of you naturally.","I have a nice family and I'm well rounded.","I always want to be the best and if I can't, I don't want to run.","I want to combine a business major with studies in clothing and textiles.","I am thrilled to be 31, still running and having my daughter watch me even if it is on TV.","Before me, sprinters retired at 23 or 24. I run because I still like it, I can make a living, and I feel I was born to do it. And because people tell me I can't do it.","The fastest way to get me to go out and do something is to tell me no way I can do it.","When I'm running fast, I don't feel anything, it's effortless, it's like my feet don't even touch the ground, it's like I'm flying."],"Evelyn Beatrice Hall":["I do not agree with what you have to say, but I'll defend to the death your right to say it."],"Evelyn Glennie":["Holidays are about experiences and people, and tuning into what you feel like doing at that moment. Enjoy not having to look at a watch.","Hearing is a form of touch. I could hear less through the ears but more through the body.","The human body and mind are tremendous forces that are continually amazing scientists and society. Therefore, we have no choice but to keep an open mind as to what the human being can achieve.","I'm not a deaf musician. I'm a musician who happens to be deaf.","I hope the seeds I have sown will be taken up by those who will follow me because the journey I have begun cannot be undertaken in isolation.","Percussion is the most adaptable family of instruments. The biggest challenge is to project percussion in a lyrical way.","And as I grew older, I then auditioned for the Royal Academy of Music in London, and they said, well, no, we won't accept you, because we haven't a clue - you know - of the future of a so-called 'deaf' musician. And I just couldn't quite accept that.","My first real foreign holiday was my honeymoon 20 years ago, and we went to Bali. It was particularly special for that reason, I enjoyed it very much - I had packed music scores and a practice drum pad, suspecting that I would be completely bored, but actually they remained in my case.","The thing about playing percussion is that you can create all these emotions that can be sometimes beautiful, sometimes really ugly, or sometimes sweet, sometimes as big as King Kong and so on. And so there can be a real riot out there, or it can be so refined.","Hearing is a form of touch. You feel it through your body, and sometimes it almost hits your face.","My favorite instrument is the snare drum. In Scotland, the snare drum is very prominent in Highland bands. The Scottish style of playing is in my blood. It's a very powerful instrument, but it can also be soothing, like velvet. It's a real challenge for composers.","I like the sparkle of the vibraphone.","Music is about communication... it isn't just something that maybe physically sounds good or orally sounds interesting; it's something far, far deeper than that.","As we live longer and healthier for longer, we need to keep ourselves busy... the diary is pretty full.","Once you're in a particular country, and you're surrounded by musicians who are so adept at traditional music, you suddenly realize how much there is to explore and digest and learn and experience.","A lot of things which come with a high profile will always be criticised one way or another.","I want to be able to say on my deathbed that I reached a few people. That would be very nice, just to be able to say that.","Society cannot continue to disable themselves through their need to categorize people or make assumptions as to another individual's abilities.","Percussion is physical, as most instruments are. The body must function well in order to play the instruments well. Last year I climbed Mount Kilimanjaro.","Anything you strike, anything you shake or rattle, or just anything that can be picked up, and you can create a sound.","I suppose I don't hear things, but I listen, if you know what I mean. And there is a big difference between hearing and listening. So it's like a conversation, you know. When you speak to someone, it's one on one, and that's exactly how I play.","Before my teen years, I was losing my hearing pretty quickly, and I was getting very, very angry. I was beginning to become an angry person because of that.","I walk into a kids' store, and it's amazing, the types of instruments - little squeaky things, rattling things, spinning tops.","Concerts have to be seen as a real event for which the aim is to try and feed everybody.","I didn't decide to become a musician until the age of 15, which is quite late.","There are many collaborations I'd like to explore. One is to co-write a rap concerto with Eminem.","I've kept a diary since I was 11.","I often play on the cello-bass side of the orchestra, because I prefer the deep sounds. I can't hear the violins well.","I think I can only help to expose percussion to all sorts of people. The balance between the lighter and more serious side is important.","Apart from Scottish traditional music, I wasn't really influenced by any kind of music. I just basically followed my own instincts.","When I was 12, I happened to see a schoolmate playing percussion, and it looked interesting. I asked for lessons, and it felt right.","My role on the planet is to bring the power of sound.","There's still a lot I need to do as a player, as a musician, as a sound creator. I have commissioned 170 pieces: that's still not enough, there are still lots and lots of composers I would like to approach. When I see a composer and I see a performer, I think to combine those forces.","I am really quite fascinated by echo-locating bats and dolphins and have always wondered how sound affects the unconscious brain.","If we see someone in a wheelchair, we assume they cannot walk. It may be that they can walk three, four, five steps. That, to them, means they can walk.","Music really is our daily medicine.","What I have to do as a musician is do everything that is not on the music.","It's the things that you notice when you're not actually with your instrument that, in fact, become so interesting, and that you - you want to explore, through this tiny tiny surface of a drum.","If I just simply let go, and allow my hand, my arm, to be more of a support system, suddenly - I have more dynamic with less effort. Much more, and I just feel, at last, one with the stick, and one with the drum.","The audience plays a huge part in how a piece will actually form. They really allow the performers to walk a tightrope in a way that never seems to happen in the privacy of your own four walls. I'm listening to the audience, and they're listening to me.","The body's like a huge ear. It's as simple as that.","Marimba is much more of a wood-type experience and there is no real possibility of getting a dry sound, and getting that contrast in the same way that you can in a vibraphone.","I just assumed the world was full of solo percussionists. I couldn't find sticks or music or anything where I was, but that was expected because there was nothing there anyway. And I think that was possibly the greatest asset for me, just not knowing.","Your mallet or your stick goes through the instrument, the sound goes out and then wherever the sound goes nobody knows, you know.","A large part of my work has been collaborating with composers; I think we've commissioned about 140 pieces now, a lot of them percussion concertos.","My hearing is out of the ordinary as others might see it, but not for me. I'm used to my hearing in the same way that I'm used to the size of my hands.","I associate going to an airport with work because I travel so much with my job. So when I have a few days free from work, I tend to stay at home.","I love out-of-the-way, rugged places. For me, holidays are about the experiences, and the people, and the memories, rather than sitting on a nice beach getting tanned. I try to plant myself where I am and embrace what is there in front of me."],"Evelyn Keyes":["I was the original Cinderella girl, looking for the happy ending in the fairy story. But my fantasy prince never came.","I was always interested in the man of the moment - and there were so many such moments.","I'm the first to admit that I never achieved my potential as an actress.","I have often wondered what my life would have been like if I had needed a size thirty-eight bra instead of a modest thirty-four.","I got to star in my own movies. I even had my name above the title in some cases. But what am I known for? My bit part.","I was always looking for the same man - a strong father figure.","To become a big movie star like Joan Crawford, you need to wear blinders and pay single-minded attention to your career. Nobody paid attention to me, including me."],"Evelyn Lauder":["One of the most important things about looking youthful is to have a modern haircut.","Make-up is the last thing to enhance your beauty, but it's very important because it builds up your self-confidence and gives you more courage.","I never leave the house without putting on my lipstick.","It's important to maintain an attractive smile as you age. A lighter, less beige, more white tooth color is key, but no Chiclets.","I have as much pink as you can have. I love to see other women in pink. It's good for every shade of skin and hair.","The most helpful piece of advice that I could give to anybody is to select a charity, or create a charity, that you really feel passionate about and if you do, don't give up.","Of capital importance is to have a good diet and exercise a lot.","I keep up with everything in terms of health, fitness, nutrition, skin care, hair, nails. Really, everything. I'm an avid reader of every women's health newsletter from every hospital in the country.","I absorb the science section of 'The New York Times.' You know, I have a degree: I'm an A.A.D. Almost a Doctor.","I believe in nonfat. I gain two pounds when I eat a lamb chop.","When I create an image that helps someone - even just myself - find peace, then I've attained my goal.","I've always been a person who is driven.","I feel it's important to make a mark somewhere.","Color is a big part of what I do. It's like music. There are only so many notes in the scale, but there are endless permutations; there's no limit to the number. Color on the walls or furniture can reflect back and distort the reality of the true colors of lipsticks and eye shadow.","My efforts to join the fight against breast cancer all began around the fact that women were getting short-changed in the medical arena.","The gratification of helping others is a very American tradition and a Judeo-Christian tradition. Now it is great to see young people creating funds and giving back in all sorts of productive ways. It's a terrifically satisfying thing.","There is physical evidence of the body's response to doing good. Endorphins are released in the brain when you do something for someone else. Doing good really feels good.","Knowing how to age and not being afraid of aging is very healthy.","It takes only five minutes to look nice before you go out."],"Evelyn Underhill":["Deliberately seek opportunities for kindness, sympathy, and patience.","The direction and constancy of the will is what really matters, and intellect and feeling are only important insofar as they contribute to that.","God is acting on your soul all the time, whether you have spiritual sensations or not.","God is much in the difficult home problems as in the times of quiet and prayer.","Towards my husband, I often fail to show interest in his affairs and amusements, not rousing myself to respond when I'm tired or concerned with other things, forgetting he is very patient with me.","God is always coming to you in the Sacrament of the Present Moment. Meet and receive Him there with gratitude in that sacrament.","All things are perceived in the light of charity, and hence under the aspect of beauty; for beauty is simply reality seen with the eyes of love.","After all it is those who have a deep and real inner life who are best able to deal with the irritating details of outer life.","Every minute you are thinking of evil, you might have been thinking of good instead. Refuse to pander to a morbid interest in your own misdeeds. Pick yourself up, be sorry, shake yourself, and go on again.","You don't have to be peculiar to find God.","Adoration is caring for God above all else.","Try to arrange things so that you can have a reasonable bit of quiet every day.","The will is what matters - as long as you have that, you are safe.","Never forget that the key to the situation lies in the will and not in the imagination.","In my relations with my father, which are difficult and where I'm often met by coolness and indifference, I am constantly tempted to be cold and indifferent. Yet I know that this is a test if I could take it rightly.","There is no place in my soul, no corner of my character, where God is not."],"Evelyn Waugh":["Art is the symbol of the two noblest human efforts: to construct and to refrain from destruction.","Punctuality is the virtue of the bored.","One forgets words as one forgets names. One's vocabulary needs constant fertilizing or it will die.","Perhaps host and guest is really the happiest relation for father and son.","He was gifted with the sly, sharp instinct for self-preservation that passes for wisdom among the rich.","It is a curious thing... that every creed promises a paradise which will be absolutely uninhabitable for anyone of civilized taste.","I think to be oversensitive about cliches is like being oversensitive about table manners.","Professional reviewers read so many bad books in the course of duty that they get an unhealthy craving for arresting phrases.","Instead of this absurd division into sexes they ought to class people as static and dynamic.","Almost all crime is due to the repressed desire for aesthetic expression.","In the dying world I come from, quotation is a national vice.","Not everyone grows to be old, but everyone has been younger than he is now.","When we argue for our limitations, we get to keep them.","There are no poetic ideas; only poetic utterances.","The truth is that Oxford is simply a very beautiful city in which it is convenient to segregate a certain number of the young of the nation while they are growing up.","News is what a chap who doesn't care much about anything wants to read. And it's only news until he's read it. After that it's dead.","Pray always for all the learned, the oblique, the delicate. Let them not be quite forgotten at the throne of God when the simple come into their kingdom.","We cherish our friends not for their ability to amuse us, but for ours to amuse them.","Manners are especially the need of the plain. The pretty can get away with anything.","We schoolmasters must temper discretion with deceit.","I haven't been to sleep for over a year. That's why I go to bed early. One needs more rest if one doesn't sleep.","I put the words down and push them a bit.","We class schools into four grades: leading school, first-rate school, good school and school.","Your actions, and your action alone, determines your worth.","My unhealthy affection for my second daughter has waned. Now I despise all my seven children equally.","Don't hold your parents up to contempt. After all, you are their son, and it is just possible that you may take after them.","Money is only useful when you get rid of it. It is like the odd card in 'Old Maid'; the player who is finally left with it has lost.","Other nations use 'force'; we Britons alone use 'Might'.","What is youth except a man or woman before it is ready or fit to be seen?","There is a species of person called a 'Modern Churchman' who draws the full salary of a beneficed clergyman and need not commit himself to any religious belief.","All this fuss about sleeping together. For physical pleasure I'd sooner go to my dentist any day.","If we can't stamp out literature in the country, we can at least stop its being brought in from outside.","You never find an Englishman among the under-dogs except in England, of course.","The human mind is inspired enough when it comes to inventing horrors; it is when it tries to invent a Heaven that it shows itself cloddish."],"Evelyn de Morgan":["Art is eternal, but life is short.","I will make up for it now, I have not a moment to lose."],"Evelyne Brochu":["It's very joyful to be in a productive, creative mood, but I find a lot of joy in learning and being told stories.","Once, I was going to a film event, and someone told me not to wear high heels to it. They said that it might intimidate the men. For some reason, I was ready to take their cue, but about an hour later, something in my head started ringing, and I thought, 'That is the worst advice anybody's ever given me.'","I think, at some point, there's only so much you can draw from within without getting inspired from what's around you and what other people are doing.","My criteria is always, 'Would I go see this movie? Is this character something I've never done? Who is the director? Do they inspire me?'","I really think truth comes from the body. When you're running for your life, you breathe differently; you talk differently.","I feel the less you project of yourself, the more you can be believable as a character. I also think it's just better for your own mental health. Then you can be a human being and change your mind, and nobody asks you questions about it!","I'm not a huge spender. Sometimes when you pay a lot, you're paying for the company's advertising. It feels ridiculous to pay for a name.","I don't like shopping that much. I do it for an hour, and then I feel empty inside and weird.","Sometimes, in the summer, I just step out of my home, and I see all these people - Montreal is like El Dorado. It doesn't exist. It's so perfect and beautiful and multicultural and chill and fun.","I've been travelling a lot, and so I believe in not owning so much.","Human beings are created with empathy. Art serves that purpose. So why should I be disinterested in a character who's a man, and why should a man shy away from a show that's female-driven?"],"Everett Dirksen":["A billion here, a billion there, and pretty soon you're talking about real money.","During a political campaign everyone is concerned with what a candidate will do on this or that question if he is elected except the candidate; he's too busy wondering what he'll do if he isn't elected.","There is no force so powerful as an idea whose time has come.","I am a man of fixed and unbending principles, the first of which is to be flexible at all times.","The oil can is mightier than the sword.","The mind is no match with the heart in persuasion; constitutionality is no match with compassion.","When a member of the House moves over to the Senate, he raises the IQ of both bodies.","When all is said and done, the real citadel of strength of any community is in the hearts and minds and desires of those who dwell there.","We are becoming so accustomed to millions and billions of dollars that 'thousands' has almost passed out of the dictionary.","We have been through this is biennial convulsion four or five different times over the past 10 or 12 years, and now it appears that we are going through this quiet agony all over again.","I have said, with respect to authorization bills, that I do not want the Congress or the country to commit fiscal suicide on the installment plan.","But the basic difficulty still remains: It is the expansion of Federal power, about which I wish to express my alarm. How easily we embrace such business."],"Everett McGill":["I've done soap operas in New York, playing a continuing character who goes through changes and develops, but none of that has created the enduring interest that 'Twin Peaks' has.","'Quest' is a romantic name for journey, and I think 'fire' is a word that has stimulating connotations for all of us.","In Kansas, people are reserved, quiet, taciturn.","I couldn't stand the thought of not succeeding; failure was more than I could deal with.","I know I may never emerge as a leading man.","I recognize my physical limitations, but I am an actor who is able to transform himself into someone else.","If you lost a major actor because of a broken jaw, the project collapses.","I don't see many convincing heavies in movies. They don't scare me.","I know actors with promising careers who get blown out of the business, never to return.","On the stage, you enter into a bond with the audience, and you can sense they are moved by what you're doing. It's a sweet return.","Emotional sounds don't lie.","The director can't do your job for you. He can't get in front of the camera and perform your part.","You have to add something of yourself to the portrayal.","We need to emphasize the more positive aspects of our species."],"Evgeny Morozov":["Information technology has been one of the leading drivers of globalization, and it may also become one of its major victims.","A vibrant civil society can challenge those in power by documenting corruption or uncovering activities like the murder of political enemies. In democracies, this function is mostly performed by the media, NGOs or opposition parties.","Search without Google is like social networking without Facebook: unimaginable.","Creative experimentation propels our culture forward. That our stories of innovation tend to glorify the breakthroughs and edit out all the experimental mistakes doesn't mean that mistakes play a trivial role. As any artist or scientist knows, without some protected, even sacred space for mistakes, innovation would cease.","Technology changes all the time; human nature, hardly ever.","'Solutionism' for me is, above all, an unthinking pursuit of perfection - by means of technology - without coming to grips with the fact that imperfection is an essential feature of liberal democracy.","We can now with Google Glasses record everything around us, and we can make sure that nothing is ever forgotten because everything is stored somewhere in Google servers or somewhere else.","You know, anyone who wears glasses, in one sense or another, is a cyborg.","Surveillance cameras might reduce crime - even though the evidence here is mixed - but no studies show that they result in greater happiness of everyone involved.","When we can commit a crime, we can also trigger debate. Cases go to courts. Media start covering the cases. But once you build smart environments where, if you meet a certain probabilistic profile, you won't even be allowed to board a bus, let alone commit a crime, we're perpetuating existing laws so they face no challenges or revision.","Technological defeatism - a belief that, since a given technology is here to stay, there's nothing we can do about it other than get on with it and simply adjust our norms - is a persistent feature of social thought about technology. We'll come to pay for it very dearly.","The idea that the Internet favors the oppressed rather than the oppressor is marred by what I call cyber-utopianism: a naive belief in the emancipatory nature of online communication that rests on a stubborn refusal to admit its downside.","Cloud computing is a great euphemism for centralization of computer services under one server.","If you trace the history of mankind, our evolution has been mediated by technology, and without technology it's not really obvious where we would be. So I think we have always been cyborgs in this sense.","However revolutionary it may be, the Internet still hasn't altered the basic law of human communication: Being nice to your interlocutors is a good way to start any negotiations, particularly, when being hostile is an open invitation for a cyber-fight.","Cyberattacks have become a permanent fixture on the international scene because they have become easy and cheap to launch. Basic computer literacy and a modest budget can go a long way toward invading a country's cyberspace.","The bigger the network, the harder it is to leave. Many users find it too daunting to start afresh on a new site, so they quietly consent to Facebook's privacy bullying.","Social media's greatest assets - anonymity, 'virality,' interconnectedness - are also its main weaknesses.","You actually see liberals checking 'Fox News,' if only to know what the conservatives are thinking. And you're seeing conservatives who venture into liberal sources, just to know what 'The New York Times' is thinking.","Truly smart technologies will remind us that we are not mere automatons who assist big data in asking and answering questions.","If you use your smart toothbrush, the data can be immediately sent to your dentist and your insurance company, but it also allows someone from the NSA to know what was in your mouth three weeks ago.","This marketization of personal information is a big mistake.","We need to start seeing privacy as a commons - as some kind of a public good that can get depleted as too many people treat it carelessly or abandon it too eagerly. What is privacy for? This question needs an urgent answer.","Steve Jobs was notoriously blunt about products he found wanting, but his attack on Flash - Adobe's popular technology for playing multimedia content inside a browser - was particularly vicious. Claiming it was buggy and insecure, Jobs banned it from the iPad.","If China's expansion into Africa and Russia's into Latin America and the former Soviet Union are any indication, Silicon Valley's ability to expand globally will be severely limited, if only because Beijing and Moscow have no qualms about blending politics and business.","Just as Josef K, the protagonist of Kafka's 'The Trial,' awoke one day to discover that he had become part of some unfathomable legal carnival, we, too are frequently waking to discover that the rules of the digital game have once again profoundly changed.","Jean-Paul Sartre, the existentialist philosopher who celebrated the anguish of decision as a hallmark of responsibility, has no place in Silicon Valley.","Most other documents leaked to WikiLeaks do not carry the same explosive potential as candid cables written by American diplomats.","One possible future for WikiLeaks is to morph into a gigantic media intermediary - perhaps, even something of a clearing house for investigative reporting - where even low-level leaks would be matched with the appropriate journalists to pursue and report on them and, perhaps, even with appropriate NGOs to advocate on their causes.","To understand the limits and opportunities of algorithms in the context of artistic creation, we need to understand that the latter usually consists of three elements: discovery, production, and recommendation.","WikiLeaks is what happens when the entire U.S. government is forced to go through a full-body scanner.","When someone at the State Department proclaims Facebook to be the most organic tool for promoting democracy the world has ever seen - that's a direct quote - it may help in the short run by getting more people onto Facebook by making it more popular with dissidents.","The message I'm trying to send is that technology is political, and that many decisions that look like decisions about technology actually are not at all about technology - they are about politics, and they need to be scrutinized as closely as we would scrutinize decisions about politics.","When it is about technology, there is this tendency to just reject all criticism as being anti-technological and anti-modern. I think this is very unhealthy.","I went to SXSW in 2011. God, that was awful. I mean, I only went because my publisher wanted me to promote the book and the organizers invited me and it seemed silly not to go, especially for a relatively unknown first-time author. This is just not my cup of tea; the fewer such events I do on an annual basis, the happier I feel.","I'm rarely invited to start-up parties, but who cares about their trinkets and apps anyway?","I spent two years in Palo Alto - what an awful, suffocating place for those of us who don't care about yoga, yogurts and start-ups - and now I have moved to Cambridge, MA - which, in many respects, is like Palo Alto but a bit snarkier.","The reason why there is more pessimism about technology in Europe has to do with history, the use of databases to keep track of people in the camps, ecological disasters.","A lot of the geeks in Silicon Valley will tell you they no longer believe in the ability of policymakers in Washington to accomplish anything. They don't understand why people end up in politics; they would do much more good for the world if they worked at Google or Facebook.","There is this absurd assumption that the revitalisation of the public sphere is always a good thing. I think people tend to confuse 'civic' and 'civil,' and they believe that everything that is done by citizens is necessarily a good thing because you build a network, an association.","The Internet can empower groups whose aims are in fact antithetical to democracy.","You know, it's not a given that there is an 'online' and 'offline' world out there. When you use the telephone, you don't say that I'm entering some 'telephono-sphere.' You don't say that, and there is no obvious need to say that when you are using a modem.","I have no problem with technological solutions to social problems. The key question for me is, 'Who gets to implement them?' and, 'What kinds of politics of reform do technological solutions smuggle through the back door?'","I'm not on Facebook. I have a sort of anonymous account that I check, like, once every six months every time Facebook rolls out a new feature.","It is true that authoritarian governments increasingly see the Internet as a threat in part because they see the U.S. government behind the Internet.","Russian young people spend countless hours online downloading videos and having a very nice digital entertainment lifestyle, which does not necessarily turn them into the next Che Guevara.","For many oppositional movements, the Internet, while providing the opportunity to distribute information more quickly and cheaper, may have actually made their struggle more difficult in the long run.","The director of the FBI has been visiting Silicon Valley companies asking them to build back doors so that it can spy on what is being said online. The Department of Commerce is going after piracy. At home, the American government wants anything but Internet freedom.","Dictators aren't stupid, or regimes could be toppled easily by young people mobilizing on Facebook.","Revolution may not be pro-Western or democratic.","I don't think love for technology itself breeds change.","I'm active on Twitter, and I love my iPad and my Kindle.","We've never thought too deeply about the roles things like forgetting or partisanship or inefficiency or ambiguity or hypocrisy play in our political or social life. It's been impossible to get rid of them, so we took them for granted, and we kind of thought, naively, that they're always the enemy.","Look at something like cooking. Now, you would hear a lot about smart kitchens and augmented kitchens. And what do those smart kitchens actually do? They police what's happening inside the kitchen. They have cameras that distinguish ingredients one from each other and that tell you that shouldn't mix this ingredient with another ingredient.","I think governments will increasingly be tempted to rely on Silicon Valley to solve problems like obesity or climate change because Silicon Valley runs the information infrastructure through which we consume information.","For much of its existence, design was all about convenience. We wanted to hide technology so that users are not distracted into thinking about the tools they use.","My fear is that many institutions will eventually alter how they treat people who refuse to self-track. There are all sorts of political and moral implications here, and I'm not sure that we have grappled with any of them.","The Internet has made it much more effective and cheaper to spread propaganda.","If you want to plan a revolution, you never do it in public - the authorities show up and arrest everyone.","In part, slacktivism is what happens when the energy of otherwise dedicated activists is wasted on approaches that are less effective than the alternatives.","Apple has an opening to say, 'The tools we are selling to you will enable you to do things rather than do things for you.' Google's vision is tools that will do things for you.","I want to prevent us reifying 'the Internet' as something to be preserved like some people want to preserve the American Constitution as it was written.","This is the real tragedy of America's 'Internet freedom agenda': It's going to be the dissidents in China and Iran who will pay for the hypocrisy that drove it from the very beginning.","If my idea was just to maintain a certain lifestyle, there would be no need to get a Ph.D. But I do care very deeply about the idea side as well.","It is easy to be seen as either a genius or a crank. If you have a Ph.D., at least you somewhat lower the chances that you will be seen as a crank.","Once Google is selected to run the infrastructure on which we are changing the world, Google will be there for ever. Democratic accountability will not be prevalent. You cannot file a public information request about Google.","The newspaper offers something very different from Google's aggregators. It offers a value system, an idea of what matters in the world. Newspapers need to start articulating that value.","There are good reasons why we don't want everyone to learn nuclear physics, medicine or how financial markets work. Our entire modern project has been about delegating power over us to skilled people who want to do the work and be rewarded accordingly.","There is something almost sacred about the Internet. I'm trying to secularize it.","I want my government to do something about my privacy - I don't want to just do it on my own.","Diplomacy is, perhaps, one element of the U.S. government that should not be subject to the demands of 'open government'; whenever it works, it is usually because it is done behind closed doors. But this may be increasingly hard to achieve in the age of Twittering bureaucrats.","I used to work for an NGO called Transitions Online, and I was their Director of New Media. I was a very idealistic fellow who thought that he could use blogs, social networks and new media to help promote democracy, human rights and freedom of expression.","Universities ought to be aware of the degree they would want to accept funding from governments like China to work on, say, face recognition technology.","There is this group of people who love innovation. Those people want to innovate, and they think the Internet is a wonderful tool for innovation, which is true. But you also have to remember that much of that innovation is constrained within the realities of the foreign policy.","There is this huge Roma problem in Europe. There are a lot of Romas who are discriminated against in countries like the Czech Republic or Hungary. They are an ethnic minority that in Europe everyone loves to hate.","It's true that virtually all new technologies do trigger what sociologists would call 'moral panics,' that there are a lot of people who are concerned with the possible political and social consequences, and that this has been true throughout the ages.","Personalization can be very useful in some contexts but very harmful in others. Searching for pizza online, it's probably OK to keep showing the same pizza shop as your No. 1 choice. I don't see any big political consequences out of that.","My hunch is that people often affiliate with causes online for selfish and narcissistic purposes. Sometimes, it may be as simple as trying to impress their online friends, and once you have fashioned that identity, there is very little reason to actually do anything else.","If WikiLeaks were a for-profit company, determining its real value would be a nearly impossible task.","As leakers take great risks in releasing information, assuring them that they are not sacrificing themselves in vain and that their leaks would have public consequences would most likely encourage more people to leak.","For all its shortcomings, Wikipedia does have strong governance and deliberative mechanisms; anyone who has ever followed discussions on Wikipedia's mailing lists will confirm that its moderators and administrators openly discuss controversial issues on a regular basis.","In China, Internet surveillance has already become a profitable industry. In fact, a growing number of private firms eagerly assist the local police by aggregating this data and presenting it in easy-to-browse formats, allowing humans to pursue more analytical tasks.","Whether greater cybersecurity requires a greater sacrifice of our digital freedoms is an important debate that we should be having, preferably with all the facts in front of us.","Much of the real computer talent today is concentrated in the private sector.","In business, standards establish the rules of the game, creating path dependencies as investments are made and corresponding designs are set in stone and plastic. Inferior standards can prevail due to smart marketing or industry collusion.","As economic life relies more and more on the Internet, the potential for small bands of hackers to launch devastating attacks on the world economy is growing.","Free open-source software, by its nature, is unlikely to feature secret back doors that lead directly to Langley, Va.","The global triumph of American technology has been predicated on the implicit separation between the business interests of Silicon Valley and the political interests of Washington.","There is no doubt that the Internet brims with spamming, scamming and identity fraud. Having someone wipe out your hard drive or bank account has never been easier, and the tools for committing electronic mischief on your enemies are cheap and widely accessible.","Military commanders do not want to be tried for war crimes, even if those crimes are committed online.","Cybercriminals are usually driven by profit, while cyberterrorists are driven by ideology.","The decentralized nature of online conversations often makes it easier to manipulate public opinion, both domestically and globally. Regimes that once relied on centralized systems of media control can now deliver ideological messages more subtly, with the help of little-known intermediaries like anonymous commenters on websites.","North Korea aside, most authoritarian governments have already accepted the growth of the Internet culture as inevitable; they have little choice but to find ways to shape it in accord with their own narratives - or risk having their narratives shaped by others.","The Egyptian experience suggests that social media can greatly accelerate the death of already dying authoritarian regimes.","In addition to their 'do no evil' motto, Googlers have always been guided by another, much less explicit philosophy: 'computational arrogance.'","In reality, quitting Facebook is much more problematic than the company's executives suggest, if only because users cannot extract all the intangible social capital they have generated on the site and export it elsewhere.","Faster roads are not always safer roads - and virtually all societies, democratic or authoritarian, prefer safety over speed, even if many of their citizens enjoy fast driving.","Would you like all of your Facebook friends to sift through your trash? A group of designers from Britain and Germany think that you might. Meet BinCam: a 'smart' trash bin that aims to revolutionize the recycling process.","As smart technologies become more intrusive, they risk undermining our autonomy by suppressing behaviors that someone somewhere has deemed undesirable.","To fully absorb the lessons of the Internet, urge the Internet-centrists, we need to reshape our political and social institutions in its image.","The implications are clear: Facebook wants to build an Internet where watching films, listening to music, reading books and even browsing is done not just openly but socially and collaboratively.","Calling China's online censorship system a 'Great Firewall' is increasingly trendy, but misleading. All walls, being the creation of engineers, can be breached with the right tools.","My homeland of Belarus is an unlikely place for an Internet revolution. The country, controlled by authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko since 1994, was once described by Condoleezza Rice as 'the last outpost of tyranny in Europe.'","Mobile phones are one of the most insecure devices that were ever available, so they're very easy to trace; they're very easy to tap.","To me, the success of the cyberactivists in Tunisia is actually very interesting, because many of them explicitly rejected any support from Washington.","Contrary to the utopian rhetoric of social media enthusiasts, the Internet often makes the jump from deliberation to participation even more difficult, thwarting collective action under the heavy pressure of never-ending internal debate.","As befits Silicon Valley, 'big data' is mostly big hype, but there is one possibility with genuine potential: that it might one day bring loans - and credit histories - to millions of people who currently lack access to them.","Making loans accessible to millions of the previously unbankable customers is a noble goal. Getting them hooked to such loans isn't.","Is there anything more self-defeating than using technology to free up your time - so that you can learn how to do an even better job at it?","A faithful lifehacker would use technology to avoid dead time and move on to the entertaining, more gratifying activities as soon as possible.","Sleephackers go to bed with sensors on their wrists and foreheads and maintain detailed electronic sleep diaries, which they often share online. To shift between sleep phases, sleephackers experiment with various diets, room and body temperatures, and kinds of pre-sleep physical exercise.","Why does crime happen? Well, you might say that it's because youths don't have jobs. Or you might say that's because the doors of our buildings are not fortified enough. Given some limited funds to spend, you can either create yet another national employment program or you can equip houses with even better cameras, sensors, and locks.","In short, Google prefers a world where we consistently go to three restaurants to a world where our choices are impossible to predict.","In Google's world, public space is just something that stands between your house and the well-reviewed restaurant that you are dying to get to.","If we don't like rent control, we ought to oppose it on political and social grounds - and not just by arguing that, thanks to smartphones and social networks, we can create new, more efficient markets for matching short-term renters with tenants."],"Evita Peron":["Shadows cannot see themselves in the mirror of the sun.","I had watched for many years and seen how a few rich families held much of Argentina's wealth and power in their hands. So Peron and the government brought in an eight hour working day, sickness pay and fair wages to give poor workers a fair go .","I will come again, and I will be millions.","Answer violence with violence. If one of us falls today, five of them must fall tomorrow.","I demanded more rights for women because I know what women had to put up with.","My biggest fear in life is to be forgotten.","To convince oneself that one has the right to live decently takes time.","If I have to apply five turns to the screw each day for the happiness of Argentina, I will do it.","In government, one actress is enough.","Where there is a worker, there lies a nation.","Keeping books on social aid is capitalistic nonsense. I just use the money for the poor. I can't stop to count it.","I am only a sparrow amongst a great flock of sparrows.","I know that, like every woman of the people, I have more strength than I appear to have.","The nation's government has just handed me the bill that grants us our civil rights. I am receiving it before you, certain that I am accepting this on behalf of all Argentinean women, and I can feel my hands tremble with joy as they grasp the laurel proclaiming victory.","Charity separates the rich from the poor; aid raises the needy and sets him on the same level with the rich.","One cannot accomplish anything without fanatacism.","Time is my greatest enemy.","I will return and I will be a million.","I am my own woman.","I am only a simple woman who lives to serve Peron and my people.","When the rich think about the poor, they have poor ideas.","Suffer little children and come unto me."],"Evo Morales":["Sooner or later, we will have to recognise that the Earth has rights, too, to live without pollution. What mankind must know is that human beings cannot live without Mother Earth, but the planet can live without humans.","I don't debate with liars.","We can pay the ecological debt by changing economic models, and by giving up luxury consumption, setting aside selfishness and individualism, and thinking about the people and the planet Earth.","We can not have equilibrium in this world with the current inequality and destruction of Mother Earth. Capitalism is what is causing this problem and it needs to end.","The way I see it, it's impossible to change things without encountering resistance.","Globalization and the neoliberal economic model have already been rejected in Latin America; it simply hasn't been a solution for our people. At the same time, Latin countries like Venezuela and Argentina are anti-imperialist and anti-globalization, and yet their economies are growing again.","Dialogue is the basis of Indian culture, and we don't want to make any enemies. Political and ideological adversaries, perhaps, but not enemies.","All of Africa's resources should be declared resources of the state and managed by the nation. Our experience in Bolivia shows that when you take control of natural resources for the people of the town and village, major world change is possible.","I'm just the democratic voice of Bolivia.","It's easy for people in an air-conditioned room to continue with the policies of destruction of Mother Earth. We need instead to put ourselves in the shoes of families in Bolivia and worldwide that lack water and food and suffer misery and hunger.","The most important thing is the indigenous people are not vindictive by nature. We are not here to oppress anybody - but to join together and build Bolivia, with justice and equality.","Capitalism is the worst friend of humanity.","Bolivia is a majority indigenous nation, but that majority has always been excluded.","The new republic should be based on diversity, respect and equal rights for all.","Globalization creates economic policies where the transnationals lord over us, and the result is misery and unemployment.","The peoples of the Andes believe in the concept of 'living well' instead of wanting to 'live better' by consuming more, regardless of the cost to our neighbors and our environment.","I am not accustomed to protocol.","I don't mind being a permanent nightmare for the United States.","Natural disasters in Bolivia have been getting worse with the passage of time. It's brought about by a system: the capitalist system, the unbridled industrialization of the resources of the Planet Earth.","This is a coca leaf. This is not cocaine. This represents the culture of indigenous people of the Andean region.","Imagine what our planet would look like with an increase in temperature of two degrees or four degrees, given that at 0.8 degrees we already have serious problems in the world.","Vaca Diez, do not destroy our country!","We are starting a process of decolonization in Bolivia. All this is bringing about change and we will continue.","Secret bank accounts are for laundering dirty money. Heads of state at the UN should put an end them. That would be the best way of tracking down the drug traffickers.","I have a lot of hope for the Constituent Assembly.","For me, being leftist means fighting against injustice and inequality but, most of all, we want to live well.","We want to overcome our historical problems with Chile. The sea has divided us and the sea must bring us back together again. Chile has agreed, for the first time, to talk about sea access for Bolivia.","I want to stress that at no time Bolivia acts untimely or irresponsibly.","Historically, foreign powers have always been the ones to keep Latin nations divided.","Bolivia's majority Indian population was always excluded, politically oppressed and culturally alienated. Our national wealth, our raw materials, was plundered. Indios were once treated like animals here. In the 1930s and 40s, they were sprayed with DDT to kill the vermin on their skin and in their hair whenever they came into the city.","Capitalism has only hurt Latin America.","We Indians are Latin America's moral reserve. We act according to a universal law that consists of three basic principles: do not steal, do not lie and do not be idle.","I never wore a tie voluntarily, even though I was forced to wear one for photos when I was young and for official events at school. I used to wrap my tie in a newspaper, and whenever the teacher checked I would quickly put it on again. I'm not used to it. Most Bolivians don't wear ties.","I have a lot of trouble understanding all the detail of finance and administration - but if you combine intellectual and professional capacity with a social conscience, you can change things: countries, structures, economic models, colonial states.","In 2005, before I was president, the state of Bolivia had only $300 million from hydrocarbons. Last year, 2007, the Bolivian state - after the nationalization, after changing the law - Bolivia received $1,930 million. For a small country with nearly 10 million inhabitants, this allows us to increase the national economy.","The U.S. should be equally responsible for diminishing the cocaine market within the United States as it is in fighting the drug elsewhere.","As an indigenous leader from Bolivia, I know what exclusion looks like. Before 1952, my people were not allowed to even enter the main squares of Bolivia's cities, and there were almost no indigenous politicians in government until the late 1990s.","In 2006, I entered the presidential palace in the main square of La Paz as the first indigenous president of Bolivia. Our government, under the slogan 'Bolivia Changes,' is committed to ending the colonialism, racism and exclusion that many of our people lived under for many centuries.","The Bolivian government has promised to guarantee autonomy in the framework of unity, legality, and with the goal of equalizing the different regions of Bolivia. It's right there in the constitution.","The relationship between the government of the United States and social and indigenous movements has always been difficult. Not just in Bolivia but worldwide. We need to have bilateral relations characterized by mutual respect."],"Ewa Kopacz":["I am a doctor - it's a profession that may be considered a special mission, a devotion. It calls for involvement, respect and willingness to help all other people.","A doctor does not ask about political views and opinions - that is how I understand my role.","To those who don't know the historical truth, I would like to say today, Poland was not an aggressor but a victim during the Second World War.","I have never said I would adopt the euro. Not today, not tomorrow, not in five years. We will introduce the euro when it will benefit Poles and Poland.","Taking care of people is the duty of every politician.","To those who are incapable of presenting the historic truth in an honest way, I want to say that Poland was not a perpetrator but a victim of World War Two."],"Ewan McGregor":["I like the idea of being a sculptor. Just me alone, making something - that solitary existence.","My feeling about seeing the world is that it's going to change you necessarily, just the very fact of being out there and meeting people from different cultures and different ways of life.","Giving kids whatever they ask for is disastrous parenting. There's no sense of something earned. I'm sorry, but when you're 12, you don't need a new cell phone every few months just because a new one comes out.","If you want to produce really horrible, obnoxious kids, say yes to them all the time.","I don't pay much attention to career or what other people think. I've always been quite arrogant.","I trained in the theatre and I love the theatre. I get such a thrill seeing anything in the theatre.","I worked as a waiter when I was 15 and got a chance to appreciate good, simple food. There's nothing better than a boiled egg with toast.","The script, I always believe, is the foundation of everything. And if you don't connect to that foundation, if you don't believe in that and feel that you wanna spend three, four months of your life exploring it, then all of the other elements are secondary.","I'm just looking for that moment to drop my Jedi knickers and pull out my real light saber.","I really want to play Princess Leia. Stick some big pastries on my head. Now that would be interesting.","You can be playing a line some way and the director wants you to change that, or you can disagree. But I always think that the creative conversation between director and actor is what leads to good work.","I'm fiercely proud to be Scottish.","I'm not a guy who takes films for strong political messages.","I'm sure it's not great fun for them, or for any parent, when their child says they want to be an actor, 'cos it's quite an uncertain business and it can be terribly hard for most actors.","I've done nudity in lots of things before. It's something that's never particularly bothered me.","I've never been one who agonizes over my work.","Success is tricky to deal with, both professionally and in your personal life.","I want to wear skinny jeans when I'm in my 70s. Why not? Who cares?","I found my partner, my life partner, and I really am in love with my wife, and we have a lovely time, and we share a long history together and children together, and that's it.","I find politicians so desperately boring. I don't trust them and don't believe in them.","I love skiing, scuba diving and hang-gliding.","The thing about parenting rules is there aren't any. That's what makes it so difficult.","A lot of parents tell their children that if they want to be an actor, that's fine, but they should do something else first, so they've got something to fall back on. It doesn't work like that, as far as I'm concerned.","As a child I was taken to the pantomime or the theatre and I would always, always fall in love with somebody on the stage. And want to have sex with them.","At school there was no acting to be had other than school plays which I did now and again.","Conservative's the last thing I am.","From there I did a one year theatre acting course in Fife, and then three years of drama school in London.","I certainly have no plans to leave London. It's a great town.","I got married because I fell in love with this woman. I had a baby with her because we wanted to have children. But that's not because of some philosophical ideal at all, no.","I left halfway through my third year to start Lipstick On Your Collar, which was the first thing I ever did.","I like to dance, but it's not my weekend activity. I'm not a clubber.","I never imagined it wouldn't work out for me. I had that absolute certainty in myself that has seen me through, I think, and my parents were absolutely behind me all the way.","I played music all through school and I kind of performed that way.","I remember in Shallow Grave I remember a few times when we'd only have to do one take. But when you did have to do more than one, you'd build on the one you'd done.","I was nine years old when I made up my mind that that was what I definitely wanted to do.","I'm just into making quality stuff if I can, with interesting people and good scripts. But it's very important that it's about something and that it says something. Otherwise, I don't know what the point is, really.","I've played in pipe bands in Scotland, and I've always played guitars and drums and stuff.","If you're suddenly doing something you don't want to do for four years, just so you've got something to fall back on, by the time you come out you don't have that 16-year-old drive any more and you'll spend your life doing something you never wanted to do in the first place.","It's not my job to try and alter the director's style - he's in charge, and I'll always give him my trust.","Mainly I was able to perform with music - I played the French horn, I would sing, and I was a drummer in the pipe band. So I think it was a way to show off.","No, no I'm not, no, but I just think... when people are naked it tells you a lot about their relationships.","Once you've agreed the script, you must be willing to go as far as it needs to go on set.","So, no, I'm not trying to crack into Hollywood, although I'll make films there if they're good scripts.","The other two things are... well, I had a huge appetite for old black and white movies on BBC 2. At the weekends they used to run matinees, and the more romantic the better.","Ultimately, you have to not worry about people thinking you should have played him differently. You're the one playing the part so it has to be yours.","It's important, that spirit of youth, and when you're 16 that can get you kickstarted.","Then I left school at 16 and worked in Perth Repertory Theatre, which was quite nearby where I lived. And I worked there for about six or seven months, as part of the stage crew.","I left it for seven years before going back on stage. I know now not to leave it so long.","I love acting and don't find it to be very hard. I recognize when I've nailed it, and I can be very proud of myself.","I was born in '71, so I remember bits of glam rock on 'Top of the Pops' toward the late '70s, but I had no idea what kind of world it was. I didn't like the music, either.","Producing good stuff can be quite tough, and it involves a lot of frustration, but I always like things to be jolly and happy, and I forget that's actually not the point at the end of the day.","I've never found acting that difficult.","I think the script is the key. Regardless of how great everybody else is working on a film, if you're working on a script that you don't think is great, you're not gonna be able to make a great film. Whereas if the script is great, then you can.","I think rehearsal can be important if it's done in a way that works. Often, rehearsal can be a waste of time.","For all of the hurtling towards climate change, there's also a lot more understanding of it than there was when we were kids. They don't call environmentalists tree huggers any more, so there's hope!","I find that the acting's getting easier - with experience, everything is more instinctual.","I don't think having separate bathrooms is a key to a successful marriage, if you love one another.","I don't do things lightly; I don't take a job then just phone it in - I've never done that.","The film I like the best is always the one I'm working on now or next.","Drama school can't make you a brilliant actor, but you can do stuff for three years - you're not going to be fired. You should just go for it all, even the stuff you think is codswallop.","I'm lucky enough that financially I don't have to feel obliged to go for the bigger stuff. I like the stories and scripts to dictate if I want to do them.","Sometimes I feel like doing smaller budget stuff. When I did 'Young Adam', for instance, I'd come out of 'Black Hawk Down' and 'The Island', and I really wanted to be on a small film set. I wanted to be on something intimate and small again, and then 'Young Adam' cropped up in a pile of scripts I was sent.","I think it's quite tricky for actors to release albums. It's difficult, because I'm an actor, you know, I'm not a musician. I love singing, but I don't have a big repertoire of songs that I've written; I mean, I've got a few, but nothing that I could fill an album with, and I don't want to do it just for the sake of it.","I've always been really uninterested in politicians and the acts of the Houses of Parliament, or government as an idea. But I'm interested in politics in that I'm a member of the world, and I have strong feelings of right and wrong, but I can't get into the ins and outs of it.","It's just fantastic to go out and meet people in the world and get to really remote places.","I especially love my Moto Guzzi.","Everything you do on set is directly related to your imagination when you read the script for the first time.","I'm in a position where I can do many things most people just daydream about.","When you take away the phone and e-mail and you don't have a million things to run around to, it allows your mind the space to think more expansively about the things that matter.","When I was a kid I was much happier watching old movies than kids' TV, and I ended up watching all the old Ealing comedies."],"Ewen Bremner":["Basically, movies come down to economics, and they're always too expensive. From a producer's point of view, an actor is either going to make him money or save him money.","I turned down plenty of films which proved to be hugely successful. And, of course, I've also had plenty of experiences where everyone thought we were doing brilliant work and it ended up pretty horrific. Same as any actor, really.","Whatever I do, it's crucial to me that I give it 100 per cent. It doesn't matter if it's a short film, stage, theatre, TV or blockbuster. It doesn't matter what level of budget or prestige it is.","If I'm not working, I have home time with my family, and if I spend that stressing what's going to happen next, then it's a waste. I have a lot to be thankful for.","As parents, I think we're always novices, and every day presents a new challenge.","Acting is a precarious business. I have had periods where I felt like I couldn't get arrested, but you have to see it as a long game.","I've proved to myself I can get along in different kinds of parts and different kinds of productions.","If I watch something, I want to be wondering what is going to happen next; I want to be engaged in a way that makes me ask questions and think about how I can relate myself to the characters and the issues that are there. But if it's just fluff, and everything is spelt out, I find it difficult to concentrate."],"Eydie Gorme":["Everything has changed. The flying changed. The airports have changed.","It was very hard for all of us. It's still very hard. The anniversary of his death just passed, and every single one of his friends, still, after all these years... it's unbelievable.","When he came back from downtown, he had forgotten to bring his license, his identification, the $2 for the wedding license. So we got married two days later.","We were with Frank as part of his very last tour.","We were at the Schubert Theater for two years. And we were the first act.","We never rehearsed.","We never heard of tape. Everything was live, live, live.","There was one year that I was on the road.","There are so many questions to be answered and so many personal compliments that we appreciate so very much.","Steve has the most unbelievable range for a man that I've ever heard.","So many have been growing with us from the very beginning of our career. Others are brand new to us.","Right now, my voice is better than ever. It changed. I have better low notes than I had before.","Now we have an audience that is so very eclectic. Big, tremendous fans.","My voice right now, hey, listen. I don't know how long it's going to last.","I learned my phrasing from Frank. I loved him so much.","I had a lot of what they call turntable hits. A lot of them.","I felt we really couldn't be separated that much. I'd had a baby, and I was traveling and working alone while he was in the Army. It was very difficult-the phone calls and all of that. I really was very depressed.","I don't like schools. And I mean, you have to call on all your friends to get them into their schools.","Before we got married, I had tremendous ambition. Once we got married and I started having children, then I just thought that that was my real life. Steve was definitely more ambitious than I.","A lot of the really great stuff fell between the tracks."],"Eyvind Johnson":["Many men of science and poets have in their own manner, by various ways and means, and aided by others, sought unceasingly to create a more tolerable world for everyone.","From the throes of inspiration and the eddies of thought the poet may at last be able to arrive at, and convey the right admixture of words and meaning.","And this we should believe: that hope and volition can bring us closer to our ultimate goal: justice for all, injustice for no-one.","A writer's work often reflects what he or she has been exposed to in life; experiences which are the groundwork of a poem or a story.","A poet or prose narrator usually looks back on what he has achieved against a backdrop of the years that have passed, generally finding that some of these achievements are acceptable, while others are less so.","In the world of the present, in our time, we feel that suffering, anguish, the torments of body and soul, are greater than ever before in the history of mankind."],"Ezekiel Elliott":["When we go out there, we have fun, but we get to work, and I think we're at our best when we're having fun. Having fun is key.","I'm not going to change; I'm going to keep grinding. I'm going to do all I can to win.","I'm a guy that can play three downs. You don't have to take me off the field. I value blocking.","Trust your landmark and run through the smoke. It's going to open up eventually.","The best way to learn is getting out there, getting reps, and making mistakes.","You definitely have to think of the perception of things before you actually do certain things. It may not seem like it's a big deal to you yourself, but there's a bigger picture.","I think actually it's kind of sad because something I looked forward to just getting to the NFL growing up was just being able to have more fun, the rules loosen up, being able to celebrate.","I live for the high expectations.","I'm just trying to go out each week and get better. I just have to be patient, and it's going to happen.","I think I'm a guy who's going to work and work hard from Day 1, and I think I'm a guy who brings a lot of versatility to the position.","The criticism is what I expect, honestly, because I'm criticizing myself every day when I come in here and watch that film. I'm trying to get better.","With every rep, you're going to get better.","We want to play a physical game and impose our will on people.","Notre Dame was my dream school growing up. But in recruiting, they had some other plans, what position they wanted me to play.","I wasn't going to play on defense in college.","I am tired of hearing about Coach Harbaugh; I think he needs to get in check with reality because, at the end of the day, you can't talk smack about a rivalry when you haven't won a rivalry game. You got to win ballgames to be able to talk behind it.","What's a priority is going out there and winning ballgames every week.","Winning the Super Bowl would be way more special than the rookie rushing record.","I'm a guy who can play all three downs, and I excel in all areas of the game.","I'm a guy who expects a lot from himself.","I wouldn't say I'm a victim of high expectations. The expectations are going to be there.","I have a lot of great players around me. I have the best O-line in football. It's what's expected.","It's always great to get more reps.","The more you see, the more you're going to learn. Just got to take advantage of the opportunity and get ready to play ball.","I just like the ball in my hands whether I'm running it or catching it.","It would be special, just to know I had the best rookie season a running back has had in this league, especially a record that's been however old it is.","You can't really sit around when you're sore. You've got to get up and work all that lactic acid out.","That's something I kind of started Week 1, so when it got to where I'm getting a little beat up, I have a routine already for getting my body back together. Just getting in the cold tank, making sure you're getting massages.","I think I probably have one of the easiest jobs in America. I get to run behind the best O-line in America.","I feel blessed. All the great running backs that have come through Ohio State - Archie Griffin, Eddie George, Beanie Wells - I'm happy that I was able to carry on that lineage this season.","You can't win every game, so I've just got to get back to work and get better next week.","I'm a versatile guy. I'm a third-down back.","I've given it all from my combine to my pro day to my meetings with teams.","To me, a good running back is a good defense. A good running back helps you keep your defense off the field.","I've worked on my game, and I don't think it has any holes, no weaknesses. I say that with humility because you can always work to get better. But I run inside, I run outside, and I'm just not a guy you have to take off the field for certain packages.","I obviously love to run the ball.","I think I have great hands out of the backfield.","I think I'm a guy who is going to come in and work hard from Day One.","I think at Ohio State, we're professional athletes in Columbus.","There's only one professional team in Columbus, the Blue Jackets, but Ohio State is a football state.","I think I've been doing a good job of just making sure that I'm taking care of my body.","I just don't like how long the jersey is. I don't like to tuck it in, so I like to tuck it up under.","I want to go play behind that great offensive line they have down in Dallas.","I think I do deserve more than 11 carries. I think I really do.","We should be able to have a little more fun. I think it's entertainment to the fans.","I think they're taking a little bit of the fun out of this pro game.","I understand what's expected of me. I understand the lineage for the running back position of the Dallas Cowboys.","Nobody's expectations are going to be more than mine.","This is a physical game, and that's how you have to play. When you do that, the defense eventually gets tired of tackling you.","Whoever wins MVP, whoever wins whatever those awards are, that's not my decision.","My job is to go out there and play football. My job is to go out there and win football games.","If we go out there, and we play well and win football games, all the good stuff will come with it. It's not my job to worry about something I can't control.","Ohio means a lot to me. Kinda like a second home, just the memories I have here and the fans I made while at Ohio State with the things that I accomplished at that great university.","We've talked before what is important is week in, week out, getting wins and getting better.","Witten was my guy. I stayed in Wit's hip pocket and did everything I could to learn from him, learn how to be a pro.","It should be about this team, and it should be about these guys. It should be about our relationship. It shouldn't be about records.","In playoff football, you've got to be physical. You've got to run the ball.","It just helped going to work every day, knowing that you're going to work with guys that believe in you; you're going to work for guys that believe in you. You want to perform for them.","You kinda got to embrace expectations, but it's not something I pay attention to.","Once you make a mistake, it's kind of in your head what you need to do and what exactly is going on.","Once you make that first mistake, it kind of clears up everything, and everything can come to you.","I'm a competitor.","I hate to lose more than I love winning, and I'm coming to Dallas to win a Super Bowl.","The money between the first pick and the 10th pick - that's a big difference! That's like a $10-million-dollar difference.","That's just how I live my life. That's how I was raised: to demand excellence out of myself.","You don't want to attack one game more than another.","You can't go out and press. That's when you're going to make mistakes. Just act like you've done it before.","I think it's just a chemistry thing, feeling each other out. The more you play with each other, the better it's going to be.","I'm going to go out there and do what I do and play football, and everything will work out.","Honestly, the type of runner I am, I'm a physical guy, and I try to set the tone early in the game, so you're going to see it a lot in the first and second quarter.","I'm going to finish my runs hard, and I'm going to try to set the tone.","Honestly, when I'm out there, I really don't even think about them as guys with names. I look at them as numbers.","The way I approach things is that I'm a physical player.","Every play, I'm trying to get as many shots on the opposing team as I can, so when you get to the fourth quarter, they obviously don't want to be on the field anymore.","During the game, there has to be a moment where you have to set the tone. You have to let them know that you're a physical player.","When you let those defensive backs know that you're a physical player, they don't really want to tackle. That's it. That's why you see me get a hurdle every game. Those guys don't want to tackle me when I get to the second level.","I take pride in being a jack of all trades.","I don't think, as a player, I have a weakness on the field. I've done a great job of becoming good at everything, so I think that's what separates me.","I'm a great pass catcher. I'm excellent in pass protection, which is the most important thing. You can't play, you can't get on the field if you don't protect that franchise quarterback.","I'm a great inside and outside runner.","I'm focused on going out and winning ballgames. Focused on getting better with the team every week.","The NCAA has its rules. It's our job to abide by them."],"Ezekiel Emanuel":["Patients who are being kept alive by technology and want to end their lives already have a recognized constitutional right to stop any and all medical interventions, from respirators to antibiotics. They do not need physician-assisted suicide or euthanasia.","Vaccines are the most cost-effective health care interventions there are. A dollar spent on a childhood vaccination not only helps save a life, but greatly reduces spending on future healthcare.","Childhood vaccines are one of the great triumphs of modern medicine. Indeed, parents whose children are vaccinated no longer have to worry about their child's death or disability from whooping cough, polio, diphtheria, hepatitis, or a host of other infections.","I'm the son of a pediatrician, and I do believe that the most important resource we have is our kids. And I think the most important thing for America's future is to invest more in our children.","By establishing a social policy that keeps physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia illegal but recognizes exceptions, we would adopt the correct moral view: the onus of proving that everything had been tried and that the motivation and rationale were convincing would rest on those who wanted to end a life.","Americans tend to endorse the use of physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia when the question is abstract and hypothetical.","Where I came from, just nodding and smiling when someone expressed views was the ultimate insult. If people weren't yelling about politics in our house then they were arguing about music, or movies, or food.","Medical school education and post graduate education emphasize thoroughness.","Physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia have been profound ethical issues confronting doctors since the birth of Western medicine, more than 2,000 years ago.","As an academic, what do you have? You have the quality of your work and the integrity with which you do it.","Anyone who lives in Washington and has an official position viscerally understands the cost of a lack of privacy. Every dinner - especially ones with a journalist in attendance - is preceded by the mandatory, 'This is off the record.' But everyone also knows, nothing is really 'off the record.'","There's nothing to be gained, and much to be lost, in trying to bend every child to match a one-size-fits-all notion of what it means to be a boy or girl of a specific age. Better to set a few parameters and then go with the flow. Call it 'jazz parenting.'","My father always has been attractive because of his energy, warmth, charm, and talent for finding some connection with people from all cultures and walks of life. He rarely observed social formalities and niceties - something he has passed on to his boys.","The assumption should be that we will not appear in print or the blogosphere. Having dinner should not be fodder for Facebook. And this is just as true for 'public personalities' as it is for the average person. After all, even people in the public eye have a right to a private life.","When my children were growing up, we began every family meal - which included breakfast and dinner every day - with a prayer. We are Jewish and so it was the prayer over bread, when we were having bread, or the catch-all prayer for everything when we weren't.","We don't have enough solid organs for transplantation; not enough kidneys, livers, hearts, lungs. When you get a liver and you have three people who need it, who should get it? We tried to come up with an ethically defensible answer. Because we have to choose.","Our dad hugged us and kissed us so much that some friends and relatives complained that he was going to turn us into sissies or homosexuals. But my dad didn't care. Let them raise their kids in a reserved and reticent way. He grew up in Israel, and his boys were going to be hugged and kissed by their father and know they were loved.","My mother saw nothing inconsistent in her traditional desire to look after her husband and children and her radical politics. She began her civil rights work before most people had ever heard the word 'feminism,' and in those early years, she was focused on racial justice.","We had a big controversy in the United States when there was a limited number of dialysis machines. In Seattle, they appointed what they called a 'God committee' to choose who should get it, and that committee was eventually abandoned. Society ended up paying the whole bill for dialysis instead of having people make those decisions.","The situation around Terri Schiavo was a deeply held conflict over what to do if someone isn't going to return to consciousness or competence. Who will decide? Even there, where we had settled legal rules, we still had disagreement. We're torn about these things.","We're all on a continuous journey to try and fix our mistakes and flaws. And, believe me, I've got plenty of them.","Reasoning based on cost has been strenuously resisted; it violated the Hippocratic Oath, was associated with rationing, and derided as putting a price on life... Indeed, many physicians were willing to lie to get patients what they needed from insurance companies that were trying to hold down costs.","Truth be told, for a 21st Century American Jew there is something hollow in the Seder's liberation story and the commandment to feel as if you were there.","I guess, as an Emanuel, I have a voice that carries.","Guilt. It comes naturally to me as a Jew and a Liberal.","I am not sure precisely why we need to have privacy, but everyone knows for sure that we need to relax and not have to put on our social, outwardly looking face all of the time.","The president recognizes that funding global health is good for national security, domestic health and global diplomacy. Consequently, President Obama has steadily increased funding for the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, which was created by President Bush and has strong bipartisan support.","Having been an oncologist and having cared for scores, if not hundreds, of dying patients, when you don't have a treatment that can shrink the tumor and the patient will die, it's a very difficult conversation. It's emotionally draining.","For months, my parents had been trying to prepare me for the arrival of a real sibling. They had given me a doll to play with and encouraged me to take care of her. And when the baby, a little boy they named Rahm, finally arrived, they encouraged me to help take care of him, too.","On any given day, my father wasn't likely to return from work before I was asleep for the night. I saw that a man's work was important, that he must pursue it tirelessly, and that it might require certain sacrifices, like being away from the warmth and comfort of home.","In the time when my mother began standing up against prejudice and racism, the vast majority of white Americans rarely thought about civil rights.","In the 1950s and 1960s, many parents were generally standoffish with their male children and acted as if they were raising a generation of would-be soldiers. I remember some of my friends' parents who would shake their children's hands at bedtime.","The death of a 20-year-old woman is intuitively worse than that of a 2-month-old girl, even though the baby has had less life. The 20-year-old has a much more developed personality than the infant, and has drawn upon the investment of others to begin as-yet-unfulfilled projects.","It is terrible when an infant dies, but worse, most people think, when a three-year-old child dies, and worse still when an adolescent does."],"Ezer Weizman":["Honey, have you ever seen a man knitting socks?","Give it a kick at the right place and it'll work.","We have a country that is in a very delicate situation.","Leave my image alone... I will behave as I think I should and I will not change anything."],"Ezra Cornell":["Idleness is to the human mind like rust to iron.","I have always considered that choosing a companion for life was a very important affair and that my happyness or misery in this life depended on the choice.","There is nothing I have to reflect on that gives me more satisfaction than the fact that my life is insured for the benefit of my Dear Wife and children.","I was glad to hear of that determination as I detest the practice of cousins marrying or any marriage between persons in which there can be traced the most distant relationship. I go for the improvement instead of the deterioration of our race.","I want to go where I can be of the most service to the general enterprise.","Enquire what the effect of large endowments are upon colleges.","In 1844, there was a balance of perhaps of a couple of thousand dollars on the cr side.","I read the book with interest, but when Jackson was a candidate in 1828 for the Presidency, I opposed him and voted for Adams. I favored a protective tariff.","The summer of 1830 I... blasted the tunnel through the rock to take water from the dam above the falls for the mill... In 1831 we lowered the tunnel four feet, and built a new dam across the creek.","The Soul of man is made an article of merchandize by his fellow man and can such a land be happy? No! Happyness does not dwell in any land that is scard by the blighting curse of Slavery.","As for the Pope, I am too old to be frightened by his shadow, and am quite sure his shadow or Substance will do less harm to the liberties of my country than will a party, who seek to acquire political power by exciting religious bigotry in the minds of their duped followers.","There is a great reform required in the education and habits of females.","My dear, the duty that devolved wholly on you in my absence of guiding and expanding the minds of our dear children is a laborious one and a responsible one.","I have a fine lot of telescopes. I have one with which I can see the Mountains in the Moon.","Yesterday I staked off the ground on the hill for an orchard. I want to get 1,000 apple trees agrowing."],"Ezra Klein":["My only advice is to try to get the job that's most like the job you want, rather than the one that's more prestigious. Always try to be the talent.","When I first came to Washington, what I admired most was that people were just really, really smart with a tremendous amount of intellectual horsepower and the ability to look at an issue and say something fresh.","The idea of changing and fixing the problem of how news is presented on the Internet has been recognized for a long time.","When I talk to people about 'KnowMore', it is as an experiment. The biggest thing I'll say there is that we've learned a lot from 'KnowMore'.","One of my big beliefs about Washington is that we highly overstate the power of individuals and highly underrate seeing Washington as a system, in general, but, in particular, we highly underrate the power of Congress.","If I'm sitting around exulting over traffic data, I'm an idiot.","Every newspaper in the country covers stories that other newspapers cover. Every industry is filled with people who are competing to do the best job providing a particular service.","I think it's weird that the news cedes so much ground to Wikipedia. That isn't true in other informational sectors.","My career wouldn't exist without blogs, electronic text, hyperlinks, and mass online audiences.","The thing to remember about being young is you eventually get old.","It's not a good idea to conceptualize a static relationship with long-standing policies, like health care.","When you're trying to come up with a good approach to reporting on the bleeding edge of where the conversation's moving, you're just leaving a lot of people who aren't on the bleeding edge of that conversation out.","People set newspapers on fire; they use them for wrapping fish. The Internet does not have that property. What I don't think we've gotten is that you can make things last longer than in print."],"Ezra Koenig":["Some people say video games rot your brain, but I think they work different muscles that maybe you don't normally use.","In Europe, I always have fun bike riding in Amsterdam.","I remember the first pangs of stress arriving at the end of school. Once I graduated I had to get a full-time job, worry about health insurance, saving money, paying rent - things I'd never thought about before.","Anyways, trying to express yourself to the press is often like arguing with a hysterical person.","Making every record is a process full of tough times.","I went to Columbia University because I knew I wanted to go to a school that was academically rigorous. I prided myself on getting good grades, but I also hated it.","Musicals don't get enough credit for being so surreal. It's like an alternate universe.","I don't like to generalize but I've had nothing but bad experiences with Mexican food in Europe.","I like how Ralph Lauren creates a mystical world through his clothing.","It's so easy for anyone to deal with their own guilt of being a middle-class white music fan by pointing to other people who they perceive to be richer than them, whiter than them.","Well, growing up in the '90s, my first true love was ska music.","If kids and teenagers can get into a band, it's probably not because they think it's brainy.","Sometimes you want to dress a certain way... that doesn't always reflect your pedigree.","I grew up listening to Jay-Z, and I think the first time I really became obsessed with learning and thinking about lyrics was when I started listening to rap; I was 11, 12, and started becoming aware of music beyond the familiar.","I do think sometimes there's danger in guest appearance mania. I've seen too many examples that sound cool on paper, like 'Oh, get that guy to sing the hook on that guy's song,' and then that's all it is. It's a cool idea that sounds good on paper.","Rapping and singing are not two polar opposites. There's so much middle ground. And I think there's a lot of people who find that middle ground.","I'm pretty sure that the Walkmen are the band that I've paid to see the most in my life.","My dad has a really great record collection that basically went up to the year I was born: 1984.","I'm a huge fan of the Bay Area so I always love coming to San Francisco.","I go to great pains to find the best yogurt and granola.","It's cool to have instruments lying around because they give you different ideas.","Playing 'Tetris' for 15 minutes is like meditation.","I still to this day get the most inspiration from rap lyrics.","Growing up listening to rap music, you almost feel like you should have haters. That's an important part of being a successful musician. It's a good thing, I guess.","I still think that if you're excited about something, you have to work at it.","As an artist you have the luxury of maybe presenting an issue in a certain way, as opposed to actually solving it.","When Obama came to power, there was a lot of talk about a post-racial America.","All I know for sure is that issues like race, like class, are always best approached with compassion and open-mindedness.","It's pretty cool that people will pay for something even though they don't have to. It's totally different now to back in the day. Now you're paying for a record because you believe in the band. In the future that will be the only time people will pay for albums, because there's some kind of connection.","You can be 24 and continue to live like you're at college, or even continue to live like you're in high school. Or you can put on a shirt and tie and pretend to be an adult.","No part of Manhattan these days really has the same vibe I get from a Ramones song or a Velvet Underground song.","My dad grew up in a working-class Jewish neighbourhood, and I got a scholarship from my dad's union to go to college. I went there to get an education, not as an extension of privilege.","There aren't that many people walking about who are a total class stereotype.","Just because I grew up a white guy in America doesn't mean that's the music of my life."],"Ezra Miller":["It makes sense that we came up with our public school system during the Industrial Revolution because it's like everybody is a factory worker, eating their terrible food and going back to the room where you're silent and listening to an idiot. That's an epitomizing idea, getting called 'Nothing' for your whole high school experience.","Artists walk alone.","I've fallen prey to my fair share of moments of the phobias of others and the way that that can become an attack.","For a long time I felt like I was fighting my age, like I was constantly trying to prove to people that I was a savvy peer, and I felt them viewing me as a kid. I was a cocky kid, and I felt like I was an adult at, like, 9, you know? I think that's because my parents always treated me as an adult.","I don't need my sexuality celebrated, and I certainly don't need it to be criticized. I didn't necessarily want it to be observed, but here we are.","Everybody feels like an outcast because the world is so large and every fingerprint is so vastly different from one another, and yet we have these standards and beliefs, and dogmatic systems of judgment and ranking, in almost all the societies of the world.","I am very much in love with no one in particular.","The way I would choose to identify myself wouldn't be gay. I've been attracted mostly to 'she's' but I've been with many people and I'm open to love wherever it can be found.","Housing Works is the coolest thrift store in the world, because not only are they the best thrift store - they're not the most thrifty thrift store - but they have amazing stuff and all of their proceeds go directly to kids, mostly homeless kids, living with AIDS and HIV in New York, in the metropolitan area.","I'm trying to grow more limbs in order to multitask at a greater rate and I'm also investigating the possibilities of cloning. Because nothing would be more useful than having multiples of me, and that way, I could do all of the things I'd like to do in the short amount of time we all have here.","I love my family and I had a very wonderful, magical childhood. But New Jersey was actually a very cold place. There was such an intense concentration of wealth, and such a low concentration of any actual human happiness.","The No. 1 thing the people I have spent time with in my life have done for fun is playing music.","Doing things like playing music, something that's so natural and basic to human function, running around in nature, eating delicious food. These things are intrinsic in basic, primordial to human beings, so that's sort of a way to return to a blank canvas, allowing my true personality to return.","The escape to an unchallenging fairy tale can be very nice and I'm all for that, but film can also challenge you to confront the realities of our world.","When I found film, it was like, 'Of course!' It was this very intense realization that this is perhaps the most powerful, honed context that I've found.","I have a lot of really wonderful friends who are of very different sexes and genders.","I don't know if it's responsible for kids of my age to be so aggressively pursuing monogamous binds, because I don't think we're ready for them. The romanticism within our culture dictates that that's what you're supposed to be looking for.","I'm super down with being irresponsible. I'm just trying to make sure my lack of responsibility no longer hurts people.","I was a weird animal in high school, doing no work and getting straight A's.","I'm from the dirty depths of New Jersey.","I always was very interested in intellect and the massive world of knowledge out there, but in terms of being a kid who wanted to be treated as an equal, school is not the place.","I think a lot of people are projecting their own troubles and fears concerning sexuality onto those around them, and it does result in the perpetuation of a lot of hateful notions. As long as I can remember, I've felt really horrified watching those dynamics play out.","I wouldn't want to lose out on my macho action movie just because I told people I was queer.","I think everybody's crazy, and if I'm the one being a little direct about it, that's fine by me.","Life is a grand party.","The token gay character is always so funny and so fantastic. That's happened a lot. Or they're often purely victims.","My first job was when I was eight. I did this opera, which was a Robert Wilson/Philip Glass opera, called 'White Raven.' That was a very confusing and trippy creation tale, and I was a kid who brought up the sun and rotated the earth. It was very empowering.","When I was very little, I was sort of consumed by a love for opera. Weirdly enough, I went from being really enthusiastic about construction vehicles at the age of seven to being really passionate about 'La Traviata' by the time I was eight.","My mother took me to a lot of operas and when I was eight I got the opportunity to be in one and I realized that transformation into these make-believe situations was possible. I decided that was essentially what I wanted to do with my life.","I'd say I'm drawn to characters that ring true to me. Adolescence is a troubled time for everyone, so a lot of those characters have been troubled, tortured people. It's been a great way to navigate my adolescence by having these more troubled kids as an outlet.","It disturbs me when Obama says in the State of the Union address that he wants to make dropping out of school at 18 illegal, because people learn differently and before there are forms of learning for every type of person in the world, we shouldn't be condemned for leaving.","I guess the big thing is that I don't buy anything first-hand. It's a personal policy I have for all sorts of reasons. If you research to the textile industry yourself, you'll know why. I came to it personally.","You know, I was really privileged to meet Woody Allen, who is now a filmmaker, let's be honest. He's also an actor. And he's classic. And because I have no conception of what classic fashion is now, I respond to his slightly outdated sensibilities.","I'd like to make as much art as I possibly can before I die, so I'm working on a few things.","I shop only at thrift stores and vintage stores. In New York, I like a place called Star Struck, and a place called The Family Jewels.","I think I enjoy playing human beings no matter the substance of their character.","I like a role that is challenging. That's what I look for and I'm certainly always looking to move further and maybe push myself into a place that might be temporarily uncomfortable so that I might learn something.","'The Wizard of Oz' is my favorite movie. It was the first movie I can ever remember watching.","I read a lot of bad scripts and weird television shows. I don't know. There's a lot of work out there I was reading at 14 years old and noticing this lack of thought. And then, reading 'Afterschool,' that's full of thought. It was bursting with ideas.","Family is this very deep, complex thing that for most people becomes everything. It informs your entire life.","Every teenager deals in his or her own sexuality and has to face it and figure out how it can coincide with the rest of their lives in a healthy manner. And try to navigate it in our modern society, which is wrought with stigma and taboo and repression, and sort of as a result, these inner monsters that some teenagers really struggle with."],"Ezra Pound":["Either move or be moved.","I have never known anyone worth a damn who wasn't irascible.","Great literature is simply language charged with meaning to the utmost possible degree.","A slave is one who waits for someone to come and free him.","Genius... is the capacity to see ten things where the ordinary man sees one.","The real trouble with war (modern war) is that it gives no one a chance to kill the right people.","The image is more than an idea. It is a vortex or cluster of fused ideas and is endowed with energy.","Good writers are those who keep the language efficient. That is to say, keep it accurate, keep it clear.","I guess the definition of a lunatic is a man surrounded by them.","In our time, the curse is monetary illiteracy, just as inability to read plain print was the curse of earlier centuries.","The worst mistake I made was that stupid, suburban prejudice of anti-Semitism.","The art of letters will come to an end before A.D. 2000. I shall survive as a curiosity.","A general loathing of a gang or sect usually has some sound basis in instinct.","If a patron buys from an artist who needs money, the patron then makes himself equal to the artist; he is building art into the world; he creates.","When two men in business always agree, one of them is unnecessary.","Men do not understand books until they have a certain amount of life, or at any rate no man understands a deep book, until he has seen and lived at least part of its contents.","People find ideas a bore because they do not distinguish between live ones and stuffed ones on a shelf.","Nothing written for pay is worth printing. Only what has been written against the market.","A civilized man is one who will give a serious answer to a serious question. Civilization itself is a certain sane balance of values.","A great age of literature is perhaps always a great age of translations.","Humanity is the rich effluvium, it is the waste and the manure and the soil, and from it grows the tree of the arts.","Properly, we should read for power. Man reading should be man intensely alive. The book should be a ball of light in one's hand.","Colloquial poetry is to the real art as the barber's wax dummy is to sculpture.","And New York is the most beautiful city in the world? It is not far from it. No urban night is like the night there... Squares after squares of flame, set up and cut into the aether. Here is our poetry, for we have pulled down the stars to our will.","But the one thing you should. not do is to suppose that when something is wrong with the arts, it is wrong with the arts ONLY.","Good art however 'immoral' is wholly a thing of virtue. Good art can NOT be immoral. By good art I mean art that bears true witness, I mean the art that is most precise.","I could I trust starve like a gentleman. It's listed as part of the poetic training, you know.","All great art is born of the metropolis.","A man of genius has a right to any mode of expression.","It ought to be illegal for an artist to marry. If the artist must marry let him find someone more interested in art, or his art, or the artist part of him, than in him. After which let them take tea together three times a week.","Music begins to atrophy when it departs too far from the dance... poetry begins to atrophy when it gets too far from music.","No man understands a deep book until he has seen and lived at least part of its contents.","If a nation's literature declines, the nation atrophies and decays.","The modern artist must live by craft and violence. His gods are violent gods. Those artists, so called, whose work does not show this strife, are uninteresting.","The jargon of sculptors is beyond me. I do not know precisely why I admire a green granite female, apparently pregnant monster with one eye going around a square corner.","Wars are made to make debt.","Real education must ultimately be limited to men who insist on knowing, the rest is mere sheep-herding.","Literature is news that stays news.","I consider criticism merely a preliminary excitement, a statement of things a writer has to clear up in his own head sometime or other, probably antecedent to writing; of no value unless it come to fruit in the created work later.","Any general statement is like a check drawn on a bank. Its value depends on what is there to meet it.","If the individual, or heretic, gets hold of some essential truth, or sees some error in the system being practiced, he commits so many marginal errors himself that he is worn out before he can establish his point.","I have always thought the suicide should bump off at least one swine before taking off for parts unknown.","The act of bell ringing is symbolic of all proselytizing religions. It implies the pointless interference with the quiet of other people.","Allow me to say that I would long since have committed suicide had desisting made me a professor of Latin.","Gloom and solemnity are entirely out of place in even the most rigorous study of an art originally intended to make glad the heart of man.","Literature does not exist in a vacuum. Writers as such have a definite social function exactly proportional to their ability as writers. This is their main use.","Somebody said that I am the last American living the tragedy of Europe.","Religion, oh, just another of those numerous failures resulting from an attempt to popularize art.","If I could believe the Quakers banned music because church music is so damn bad, I should view them with approval.","Technique is the test of sincerity. If a thing isn't worth getting the technique to say, it is of inferior value.","No verse is libre for the man who wants to do a good job."],"Ezra Stiles":["A monarchy conducted with infinite wisdom and infinite benevolence is the most perfect of all possible governments.","War, in some instances, especially defensive, has been authorized by Heaven.","We stand a better chance with aristocracy, whether hereditary or elective, than with monarchy.","The Lord shall have made his American Israel high above all nations which he hath made.","The right of conscience and private judgment is unalienable, and it is truly the interest of all mankind to unite themselves into one body for the liberty, free exercise, and unmolested enjoyment of this right.","Let the grand errand into America never be forgotten.","A few scattered accounts, collected and combined together, may lead us to two certain conclusions: 1. That all the American Indians are one kind of people; 2. That they are the same as the people in the northeast of Asia.","Indians are numerous in the tropical regions; not so elsewhere.","There are reasons for believing that the English increase will far surpass others, and that the diffusion of the United States will ultimately produce the general population of America.","But a multitude of people, even the two hundred million of the Chinese empire, cannot subsist without civil government.","All the forms of civil polity have been tried by mankind, except one, and that seems to have been reserved in Providence to be realized in America.","But after the spirit of conquest had changed the first governments, all the succeeding ones have, in general, proved one continued series of injustice, which has reigned in all countries for almost four thousand years.","The greater part of the governments on earth may be termed monarchical aristocracies, or hereditary dominions independent of the people.","In justice to human society it may perhaps be said of almost all the polities and civil institutions in the world, however imperfect, that they have been founded in and carried on with very considerable wisdom.","With the people, especially a people seized of property, resides the aggregate of original power.","It should seem, then, that the nature of society dictates another, a higher branch, whose superiority arises from its being the interested and natural conservator of the universal interest.","Let a bill, or law, be read, in the one branch or the other, every one instantly thinks how it will affect his constituents.","The constitutions of Maryland and New York are founded in higher wisdom.","But Connecticut and Rhode Island have originally realized the most perfect polity as to a legislature.","It gives me pleasure to find that public liberty is effectually secured in each and all the policies of the United States, though somewhat differently modeled.","Besides a happy policy as to civil government, it is necessary to institute a system of law and jurisprudence founded in justice, equity, and public right.","The British merchants represented that they received some profit indeed from Virginia and South Carolina, as well as the West Indies; but as for the rest of this continent, they were constant losers in trade.","Our trade opens to all the world."],"Ezra Taft Benson":["Our parents deserve our honor and respect for giving us life itself. Beyond this they almost always made countless sacrifices as they cared for and nurtured us through our infancy and childhood, provided us with the necessities of life, and nursed us through physical illnesses and the emotional stresses of growing up.","Mothers play an important role as the heart of the home, but this in no way lessens the equally important role fathers should play, as head of the home, in nurturing, training, and loving their children.","The fellowship of true friends who can hear you out, share your joys, help carry your burdens, and correctly counsel you is priceless.","Do not leave yourself or your family unprotected against financial storms... Build up savings.","Periodic fasting can help clear up the mind and strengthen the body and the spirit.","Most of us think of pride as self-centeredness, conceit, boastfulness, arrogance, or haughtiness. All of these are elements of the sin, but the heart, or core, is still missing. The central feature of pride is enmity - enmity toward God and enmity toward our fellowmen.","One who is kind is sympathetic and gentle with others. He is considerate of others' feelings and courteous in his behavior. He has a helpful nature. Kindness pardons others' weaknesses and faults. Kindness is extended to all - to the aged and the young, to animals, to those low of station as well as the high.","The privilege of holding the priesthood, which is the power and authority to act in God's name, is a great blessing and privilege and one that carries with it equally great obligations and responsibilities.","Some of the greatest battles will be fought within the silent chambers of your own soul.","Many men and women in the world demonstrate great willpower and self-discipline in overcoming bad habits and the weaknesses of the flesh.","Opposition provides choices, and choices bring consequences - good or bad.","The moral code of Heaven for both men and women is complete chastity before marriage and full fidelity after marriage.","Youth is the spirit of adventure and awakening. It is a time of physical emerging when the body attains the vigor and good health that may ignore the caution of temperance. Youth is a period of timelessness when the horizons of age seem too distant to be noticed.","Fatherhood is not a matter of station or wealth. It is a matter of desire, diligence and determination to see one's family exalted in the celestial kingdom. If that prize is lost, nothing else really matters.","If a man does not control his temper, it is a sad admission that he is not in control of his thoughts.","Sacrifice is truly the crowning test of the gospel. Men are tried and tested in this mortal probation to see if they will put first in their lives the kingdom of God.","Husbands, recognize your wife's intelligence and her ability to counsel with you as a real partner regarding family plans, family activities, and family budgeting. Don't be stingy with your time or with your means. Give her the opportunity to grow intellectually, emotionally, and socially as well as spiritually.","Plan to build up your food supply just as you would a savings account. Save a little for storage each paycheck. Can or bottle fruit and vegetables from your gardens and orchards. Learn how to preserve food through drying and possibly freezing. Make your storage a part of your budget.","The proud do not change to improve, but defend their position by rationalizing. Repentance means change, and it takes a humble person to change.","Build traditions of family vacations and trips and outings. These memories will never be forgotten by your children.","Scouting teaches a boy to take care of himself and stand on his own two feet.","I am grateful my own eternal companion served a mission in Hawaii before we were married in the Salt Lake Temple, and I am pleased that I have had three granddaughters serve full-time missions.","Satan works through human agents.","Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ is the foundation upon which sincere and meaningful repentance must be built. If we truly seek to put away sin, we must first look to Him who is the Author of our salvation.","With pride, there are many curses. With humility, there come many blessings.","Pride adversely affects all our relationships - our relationship with God and His servants, between husband and wife, parent and child, employer and employee, teacher and student, and all mankind.","Selfishness is one of the more common faces of pride. 'How everything affects me' is the center of all that matters - self-conceit, self-pity, worldly self-fulfillment, self-gratification, and self-seeking.","If you really want to receive joy and happiness, then serve others with all your heart. Lift their burden, and your own burden will be lighter.","Our mothers put God first when they fill their highest mission within the walls of their own homes.","Your most important friendships should be with your own brothers and sisters and with your father and mother. Love your family. Be loyal to them. Have a genuine concern for your brothers and sisters.","One of the trials of life is that we do not usually receive immediately the full blessing for righteousness or the full cursing for wickedness.","Disobedience is essentially a prideful power struggle against someone in authority over us. It can be a parent, a priesthood leader, a teacher, or ultimately God. A proud person hates the fact that someone is above him. He thinks this lowers his position.","I am a witness to nations and people deprived of their freedom. I was there. I watched that great Iron Curtain drop around nations which formerly had prized their freedom - good people. I was aghast as these were written off by the stroke of a pen.","Mothers, stay close to your daughters. Earn and deserve their love and respect. Be united with their father in the rearing of your children. Do nothing in your life to cause your daughters to stumble because of your example.","Satan would have you believe that happiness comes only as you surrender to his enticements, but one only needs to look at the shattered lives of those who violate God's laws to know why Satan is called the Father of Lies.","The literal resurrection of every soul who has lived and died on earth is a certainty, and surely one should make careful preparation for this event. A glorious resurrection should be the goal of every man and woman, for resurrection will be a reality.","It is a fundamental truth that the responsibilities of motherhood cannot be successfully delegated. No, not to day-care centers, not to schools, not to nurseries, not to babysitters.","Go on daddy-daughter dates and father-and-sons' outings with your children. As a family, go on campouts and picnics, to ball games and recitals, to school programs, and so forth. Having Dad there makes all the difference.","To love God with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength is all-consuming and all-encompassing. It is no lukewarm endeavor.","To the proud, the applause of the world rings in their ears; to the humble, the applause of heaven warms their hearts.","We must not lose hope. Hope is an anchor to the souls of men. Satan would have us cast away that anchor.","A positive self-image has little relationship to our material circumstances.","No man is truly educated unless he knows where he came from, why he is here, and where he can expect to go in the next life.","Godly sorrow is a gift of the Spirit. It is a deep realization that our actions have offended our Father and our God. It is the sharp and keen awareness that our behavior caused the Savior, He who knew no sin, even the greatest of all, to endure agony and suffering.","The great test of life is obedience to God.","Becoming Christlike is a lifetime pursuit and very often involves growth and change that is slow, almost imperceptible.","Satan knows that youth is the springtime of life when all things are new and young people are most vulnerable.","Was it not through pride that the devil became the devil? Christ wanted to serve. The devil wanted to rule.","Wickedness never did, never does, never will bring us happiness.","Unless you and your mate are united in purpose, dedication, and loyalty, you will not succeed to the extent you otherwise could.","God will have a humble people. Either we can choose to be humble, or we can be compelled to be humble.","Faithful attendance at Church meetings brings blessings you can receive in no other way.","Great battles can make great heroes and heroines.","The Declaration of Independence was to set forth the moral justification of a rebellion against a long-recognized political tradition - the divine right of kings.","There will always be those little minds who, out of vanity or intellectual display, will attempt to destroy faith in the very foundations of life.","Fear of men's judgment manifests itself in competition for men's approval.","You cannot do wrong and feel right. It is impossible!","The Book of Mormon offers so much that broadens our understandings of the doctrines of salvation. Without it, much of what is taught in other scriptures would not be nearly so plain and precious.","God's revelation to Adam did not instruct Noah how to build the ark.","I rode horseback three miles each way to get to high school, and in bad weather it was a problem sometimes to make my eight o'clock class on time. Like others, I often missed school to help on the farm, especially in the fall, until after harvest, and in the spring, during planting season.","God our Father, Jesus, our Elder Brother and our Redeemer, and the Holy Ghost, the Testator, are perfect. They know us best and love us most and will not leave one thing undone for our eternal welfare. Should we not love them for it and honor them first?","Blessed are they who seek to learn wisdom.","The Saints never suffer as the sinners do.","The proud make every man their adversary by pitting their intellects, opinions, works, wealth, talents, or any other worldly measuring device against others.","Would we not do well to have the pleasing of God as our motive rather than to try to elevate ourselves above our brother and outdo another?","In a home where there is an able-bodied husband, he is expected to be the breadwinner.","Christ changes men, who then change their environment. The world would shape human behavior, but Christ can change human nature.","The earth was cursed for Adam's sake. Work is our blessing, not our doom. God has a work to do, and so should we.","In the scriptures there is no such thing as righteous pride. It is always considered as a sin.","The seeds of divorce are often sown and the problems of children begin when Mother works outside the home.","Praise your children more than you correct them. Praise them for even their smallest achievement.","When our Heavenly Father placed Adam and Eve on this earth, He did so with the purpose in mind of teaching them how to regain His presence. Our Father promised a Savior to redeem them from their fallen condition.","We must be careful, as we seek to become more and more godlike, that we do not become discouraged and lose hope.","When our children obey the Lord and go to the temple to receive their blessings and enter into the marriage covenant, they enter into the same order of the priesthood that God instituted in the very beginning with father Adam.","Time is on the side of truth.","I firmly believe in prayer. It is possible to reach out and tap the unseen power which gives strength and anchor in time of need.","Virtue is akin to holiness, an attribute of godliness.","Nations cannot endure in sin.","Many novels and modern publications are corrupters of morals or distorters of truth.","One of Satan's most frequently used deceptions is the notion that the commandments of God are meant to restrict freedom and limit happiness.","In this age of the electronic media and the mass distribution of the printed word, God will hold us accountable if we do not now move the Book of Mormon in a monumental way.","When you choose to follow Christ, you choose to be changed.","What does it mean to love someone with all your heart? It means to love with all your emotional feelings and with all your devotion. Surely when you love your wife with all your heart, you cannot demean her, criticize her, find fault with her, or abuse her by words, sullen behavior, or actions.","When we put God first, all other things fall into their proper place or drop out of our lives.","Prayer in the hour of need is a great boon. From simple trials to our Gethsemanes, prayer - persistent prayer - can put us in touch with God, our greatest source of comfort and counsel.","To lose yourself in righteous service to others can lift your sights and get your mind off personal problems, or at least put them in proper focus.","The greatest events of history are those which affect the greatest number for the longest periods.","The condition of the physical body can affect the spirit.","God lives. I know that He lives. I know that Jesus is the Christ and the Redeemer of the world.","Yes, one can repent of moral transgression. The miracle of forgiveness is real, and true repentance is accepted of the Lord.","Some men are willing to die for their faith, but they are not willing to fully live for it. Christ both lived and died for us.","Bad experience is a school that only fools keep going to.","Be right, and then be easy to live with, if possible, but in that order.","The Book of Mormon is the 'keystone' of our religion, and the Doctrine and Covenants is the 'capstone,' with continuing latter day revelation. The Lord has placed His stamp of approval on both the keystone and the capstone.","The great task of life is to learn the will of the Lord and then do it.","Pride is a sin that can readily be seen in others but is rarely admitted in ourselves.","The one man other than my father who made the most lasting impression was an uncle, Serge B. Benson. He taught me in three different classes - but above all, he taught me lessons in moral, physical, and intellectual courage that I have tried to apply in later life.","One of the joys of working with boys is that you get your pay as you go along. You can observe the results of your leadership daily... Such satisfaction cannot be purchased at any price; it must be earned.","You cannot help people permanently by doing for them what they can and should do for themselves.","When I think of how we show faith, I cannot help but think of the example of my own father. I recall vividly how the spirit of missionary work came into my life. I was about thirteen years of age when my father received a call to go on a mission.","I feel certain that if, in our homes, parents will read from the Book of Mormon prayerfully and regularly, both by themselves and with their children, the spirit of that great book will come to permeate our homes and all who dwell therein.","Pride is essentially competitive in nature. We pit our will against God's.","Our enmity toward God takes on many labels, such as rebellion, hard-heartedness, stiff-neckedness, unrepentant, puffed up, easily offended, and sign seekers. The proud wish God would agree with them. They aren't interested in changing their opinions to agree with God's.","Some prideful people are not so concerned as to whether their wages meet their needs as they are that their wages are more than someone else's. Their reward is being a cut above the rest. This is the enmity of pride.","The proud depend upon the world to tell them whether they have value or not. Their self-esteem is determined by where they are judged to be on the ladders of worldly success. They feel worthwhile as individuals if the numbers beneath them in achievement, talent, beauty, or intellect are large enough.","Pride is ugly. It says, 'If you succeed, I am a failure.'","If we love God, do His will, and fear His judgment more than men's, we will have self-esteem.","The Lord clearly defined the roles of providing for and rearing a righteous posterity. In the beginning, Adam, not Eve, was instructed to earn the bread by the sweat of his brow.","Are you honest with the Lord in the payment of your tithes? Living this divine law will bring both spiritual and material blessings.","Surely no child should fear his own father - especially a priesthood father. A father's duty is to make his home a place of happiness and joy.","Encourage good music and art and literature in your homes. Homes that have a spirit of refinement and beauty will bless the lives of your children forever.","Besides the physical ordinance of baptism and the laying on of hands, one must be spiritually born again to gain exaltation and eternal life.","The Lord works from the inside out. The world works from the outside in. The world would take people out of the slums. Christ takes the slums out of people, and then they take themselves out of the slums.","A woman whose life is involved in the righteous rearing of her children has a better chance of keeping up her spirits than the woman whose total concern is centered in her own personal problems.","Retirement from work has depressed many a man and hastened his death.","In general, the more food we eat in its natural state - without additives - and the less it is refined, the healthier it will be for us. Food can affect the mind, and deficiencies of certain elements in the body can promote mental depression.","Many a man in his hour of trial has turned to the Book of Mormon and been enlightened, enlivened, and comforted. The psalms in the Old Testament have a special food for the soul of one in distress.","Inspiring music may fill the soul with heavenly thoughts, move one to righteous action, or speak peace to the soul.","The great commandment of life is to love the Lord.","Our desires, be they spiritual or temporal, should be rooted in a love of the Lord.","God loves us; the devil hates us. God wants us to have a fulness of joy as He has. The devil wants us to be miserable as he is. God gives us commandments to bless us. The devil would have us break these commandments to curse us.","Daily, constantly, we choose by our desires, our thoughts, and our actions whether we want to be blessed or cursed, happy or miserable.","A young man who knows and loves the Book of Mormon, who has read it several times, who has an abiding testimony of its truthfulness, and who applies its teachings will be able to stand against the wiles of the devil and will be a mighty tool in the hands of the Lord.","Essentially, pride is a 'my will' rather than 'thy will' approach to life.","Faith is the foundation upon which a godlike character is built. It is a prerequisite for all other virtues.","America is a place of many great events. Here is where Adam dwelt, where the Garden of Eden was located. America was the place of former civilizations, including Adam's, the Jaredites', and Nephites'.","Communism introduced into the world a substitute for true religion. It is a counterfeit of the gospel plan.","Every man eventually is backed up to the wall of faith, and there he must make his stand.","Sound principles and eternal truths need to be frequently repeated so that we do not forget their application nor become dissuaded by other arguments.","Since the beginning, a woman's first and most important role has been ushering into mortality spirit sons and daughters of our Father in Heaven.","In the beginning, Adam was instructed to earn the bread by the sweat of his brow - not Eve. Contrary to conventional wisdom, a mother's place is in the home!","Too often the pressure for popularity, on children and teens, places an economic burden on the income of the father, so mother feels she must go to work to satisfy her children's needs. That decision can be most shortsighted.","It is mother's influence during the crucial formative years that forms a child's basic character. Home is the place where a child learns faith, feels love, and thereby learns from mother's loving example to choose righteousness.","It is a truism that children need more of Mother than of money.","An almost forgotten means of economic self-reliance is the home production of food. We are too accustomed to going to stores and purchasing what we need.","There are blessings in being close to the soil, in raising your own food even if it is only a garden in your yard and a fruit tree or two.
