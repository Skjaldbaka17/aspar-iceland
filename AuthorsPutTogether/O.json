{"O'Shea Jackson, Jr.":["Have confidence in everything. No matter what it is that you're doing, know that you can do it better than anyone.","The trials my father went through were things most young black males have to go through. There was nothing he shielded from me, because it doesn't matter how you grow up, those who oppress will oppress. It's all completely relatable; everyone feels NWA.","Being on set with my dad - that's so cool. People always ask me if that made me nervous, but it's the same element when you're a kid - when your parents come in the auditorium for those school performances. It calms you.","Our trials and our times of pain get the most recognition, but 'Straight Outta Compton' speaks to triumph. When it's doubtful, when nobody is on your side, when your back is against the wall, you triumph and make it through. Showing growth through movies promotes growth.","I want more movies like 'Straight Outta Compton.' Showing our stories of triumph, we'll make it through, and we'll get to something better.","Ice Cube's the coolest dad. A lot of parents - a lot of kids do not think their parents are cool. Oh, no. My dad's cool... You know, I was born in 1991. That's when 'Boyz n the Hood' came out. So I've always see him on TV. I don't see everybody else's dad, you know. So I've always had a sense of, you know, he's cool. He's in the light.","This entire cast, N.W.A, was an all-star group, and I really feel like people are going to look at 'Straight Outta Compton' years from now like this was an all-star cast.","USC has really developed my love for the cinema.","I want to pursue a career in film.","Music is always there, but if you're asking me my first love, it's film.","It's always extremities when you are a young black male dealing with law enforcement.","When, you know, when you're playing basketball, you have to have confidence in your moves if they're gonna work.","My parents wouldn't have sent me out into the world with wool over my eyes. You have to be aware, or you'll be swallowed.","The stress and turmoil that my father had to go through at a young age to make sure that I didn't have the same trials and tribulations, I couldn't be more grateful."],"O. Henry":["Turn up the lights. I don't want to go home in the dark.","The true adventurer goes forth aimless and uncalculating to meet and greet unknown fate.","The people of the State of Texas consist principally of men, women, and children, with a sprinkling of cowboys. The weather is very good, thermometer rarely rising above 2,500 degrees in the shade and hardly ever below 212.","Love and business and family and religion and art and patriotism are nothing but shadows of words when a man's starving!","We may achieve climate, but weather is thrust upon us.","If men knew how women pass the time when they are alone, they'd never marry.","Write what you like; there is no other rule.","It brings up happy old days when I was only a farmer and not an agriculturist.","When one loves one's Art no service seems too hard.","By nature and doctrines I am addicted to the habit of discovering choice places wherein to feed.","Bohemia is nothing more than the little country in which you do not live. If you try to obtain citizenship in it, at once the court and retinue pack the royal archives and treasure and move away beyond the hills.","Life is made up of sobs, sniffles, and smiles, with sniffles predominating.","By rights you're a king. If I was you, I'd call for a new deal.","The Venturer is one who keeps his eye on the hedgerows and wayside groves and meadows while he travels the road to Fortune.","It'll be a great place if they ever finish it.","It is said that love makes the world go 'round - the announcement lacks verification. It's wind from the dinner horn that does it.","I have been called 'The American De Maupassant.' Well, I never wrote a filthy word in my life, and I don't like to be compared to a filthy writer.","A straw vote only shows which way the hot air blows.","Inject a few raisins of conversation into the tasteless dough of existence.","She plucked from my lapel the invisible strand of lint (the universal act of woman to proclaim ownership).","I never have time to read now. I did all my reading before I was twenty.","Whenever he saw a dollar in another man's hands he took it as a personal grudge, if he couldn't take it any other way.","It couldn't have happened anywhere but in little old New York.","East is East, and West is San Francisco, according to Californians. Californians are a race of people; they are not merely inhabitants of a State.","There is one day that is ours. Thanksgiving Day is the one day that is purely American."],"O. J. Simpson":["The day you take complete responsibility for yourself, the day you stop making any excuses, that's the day you start to the top.","If there wasn't no fight, there wasn't no weekend.","I'm absolutely, l00 percent, not guilty.","I'm enjoying the money, the big house, the cars; what ghetto kid wouldn't?","My NFL pension can barely pay my son's tuition. You know, it's very little money.","I think I've been a great citizen.","I didn't beat her. I just pushed her out of bed.","I could not tell you the date of my mother's death. I could not tell you the date of my dad's death. These are not dates that I find significant.","Nicole will come up in conversations where it's in a part of the conversation. Or we may be somewhere and I would tell some story about their mother and I. You know, we always honor her birthday.","I really have reached a point where I can write a book about all of this.","Oh my God, Nicole is killed? Oh my God, she is dead?","I have always wanted to be liked and respected.","I tell inmates all the time, 'Don't complain about your grind. Do your time.'","I tend to watch a little TV... Court TV, once in a while. Some of the cases I get interested in.","I believe in the jury system.","Nobody ever accused me of pulling any weapon on them. I would never, ever pull a weapon on anybody.","I'd like to get back to my family and friends - believe it or not, I do have some real friends.","Money takes wings. The only thing that endures is character.","I'm not a guy that ever got in a fight on the street and with the public and everybody.","I had one fight in my adult life. I had the famous '89 fight with Nicole, which she admits that she initiated the physical part.","I had some problems with fidelity in my life but pretty much got along with everybody.","I don't know how often I can discuss one incident in my entire life, but I'll continue to do that.","What do you mean you have my children at the police station? Why are my kids at the police station?","I've been very clear. I won. I didn't commit the crime.","I've done my time.

I've had a great life, great friends.","I always put my fantasies in the realm of goals.","The Oscar or the Emmy says you've reached a level of competence in this business, and I would love to have one."],"O. R. Melling":["When you write for children and young adults, you have much more affect and influence on them than when you write for adults. The books that get us through our childhood stay with us for life.","All my books reflect travel adventures of some kind, and all have a soul: a spiritual or mystical underpinning.","I was fortunate in that I attended university in Canada in the early 1970s when you could take a true liberal arts degree with no programmes, majors or minors.","I'm omnivorous in my tastes, fiction and non-fiction, always several books on the go, though I'll read a novel in a day or two."],"O. T. Fagbenle":["Oakland's got a lot of character.","There's been such a pushback against political correctness, and I think that's due to the discomfort people feel talking about other people's issues that they don't fully understand.","As a man, having a conversation about feminism can be tricky - the best I can do is to have assumptions and ask questions. You always run the risk of putting your foot in it.","'The Interceptor' has an excitement and grittiness to it, but it's also very entertaining. It lives in this sphere of a slightly heightened reality where, although you completely identify and recognise all the characters in it, they're fun and exciting to watch.","There are certain directors who just don't cast diversely in prominent roles. Ever. Often it's just because they don't have a diverse social circle, so they don't think of black or brown people as husbands, best friends, bosses.","'Handmaid's' is the most profound television I've had the privilege to be a part of.","I'm interested in colour-blind hiring of directors, producers, and writers. Go to the source. Then we won't need to have conversations about colour-blind casting.","'The Interceptor' is gritty but also entertaining. The action is great as well.","I loved doing my own stunts, and so, as much as the insurance people would allow me, I would get involved.","I think what often happens when people leave their spouse for someone else is they tend to go for the opposite of what they already have.","Love is a hard thing to turn your back on.","When representation of the LBGT community was much more scarce in the media, I think there was some kind of pressure to encapsulate an entire community in a single character - this can often be a fast track to generalization and stereotypes.","I think the two main tools actors have are the imagination of what other people have gone through, to connect with and through research, and there's one's own experience.","We all fail, and we all have weaknesses. I think that's what helps us relate to characters we see on TV or read in books, is that we recognize our frailties within them and maybe don't feel so alone. We get to learn from their mistakes.","My family are quite academic, and I was set to study economics and politics at university.","We moved back to Britain for my secondary education.","As a younger man, I thought the best thing art could do was to challenge people's mindsets, and I still do, but I've come round to the value of entertainment. A show like 'The Interceptor,' which gives the audience that release, after a hard day, of just sitting down and enjoying themselves - that adds value to lives, too.","I really want to do Broadway.","My full name is Olatunde Olateju Olaolorun Fagbenle. I was named after my grandfather. It's Yoruba, which is, like, southern Nigeria.","I feel like within each of us is a million different people that we could reveal and that we can be sometimes... And for me, the process of acting isn't so much about finding the person outside of myself and mimicking them but, rather, releasing parts of myself and adding them to the character.","As an actor, you can't play a flashback; you can't play someone's memory. You just have to play each circumstance as if it was real and understand that person's point of view.","I think when YouTube first came out, everyone was thinking people were just going to watch five-minute shows from now on and that people didn't have the patience anymore to watch longer programmes. But instead, everyone is binge watching and consuming ten-hour programmes and box sets of shows, so it is really interesting.","Television is obviously changing; the way we consume media is changing, so I think it's natural that we are going to try different styles.","My family is very nomadic - my mom, in particular, traveled the world as a young person, and her father before that, and I guess I have that inside me.","I came to the States less to find fortune and fame and more to kind of have a life experience of seeing something new.","I've always had an explorative drive to my art, as opposed to wanting to achieve some certain goal.","I'm interested in working with great people and exploring great themes in different mediums.","My whole life, I have considered myself a feminist.","It's funny because I was looking back on my Instagram,, and I saw that I had a bunch of feminist posts but that was all before 'Handmaid's Tale.'","I'm hungry as an artist to find opportunities to contribute to the world in a more meaningful way than just numbing people through entertainment.","I'm not averse to a bit of travel.","The older I get, the more I dance like my dad, and I'm finding that suddenly cardigans are becoming more attractive to me.","I think you can judge a man by the size of what offends him.","Words can be an act of reductionism.","It's hard for men sometimes to talk about feminism, just as it's hard for people who aren't from ethnic minorities to talk about racial prejudice. It's a difficult conversation to have, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't have it.","I think what we forget is that everybody loses when we keep unnecessary privilege. The cost to society overall is much greater.","We've seen from shows like 'Game of Thrones' that the book can become a seed, which you plant in the ground of great TV creators, and it can sprout out into a big tree.","We have flaws, things go wrong, people's hearts get broken, people make mistakes, people fall in love with other people. And that's hard, but that's also part of life.","I think, unfortunately, we've always lived in a world of massive inequality: inequality between the haves and the have-nots, inequality between men and women that not only exists temporally but geographically as well.","I try to encourage myself to act in a way that supports gender equality, and I call that feminist. Whatever word people want to use to call that, I'm not really attached to a label.","Elizabeth Moss may very well be one of the best actresses I've had the privilege of standing opposite and sharing lines with.","Reed Morano is an amazing woman and one of the most extraordinary people I've had the chance to work with."],"O. T. Genasis":["Music changes, life changes. It's like Jay Z said: 'If people like the old Jay, then go listen to the old Jay.' I always heard that, but never understood it.","I really don't care to be criticized. I stay in my lane and do me.","Genesis means the beginning. But I put the A instead of the E because I didn't wanna be criticized in church and nothing like that. And it means the beginning, but in my city, I'm the only person that's on the West Coast that has a different sound, so I was thinking to myself, 'This the beginning of a new sound, a new person.'","At the end of the day, I have a son.","I actually think that I'm a genius; not to toot my own horn or anything, but I think I'm a musical genius.","I want to be able to do any and everything. I don't want to be limited.","Nobody wants to sit there and study lyrics the whole time, driving back from work when they just got their check after a long shift. It's not the same. Everybody just wants to be happy with life.","I have a son, and my son has autism. There's certain things that I deal with that a lot of people don't deal with.","It's different when your son is not typical, and you have to deal with him and handle him every single day.","I had a record called 'Touchdown.' It was really bubbling in my city, and I used to go to different clubs and perform.","I ended up performing one time at BET. I performed my record, like, four times, and the crowd was going super crazy. And Busta just happened to be there; he pulled me to the side and asked, 'Are you signed to anybody?' So we went to the studio a few days later, spoke, and then became business partners.","The great thing about 'Coco' is that for anybody who hears it, it just sticks.","I put out 'Rhythm & Bricks,' which showed my versatility, and I had a lot of melodic songs on there, then I had a lot of street songs on there, and I just wanted to know what everybody wanted from me. I did put that out so that everybody could get a feel, so 'Cut It' just happened to come out of there.","I'm not chasing a hit record - that's why I can make a hit record. It's not forced at all; it just happens. It's off of vibes.","I've always been a fan of music. I listened to a whole lot of oldies - I never really listened to rap music that much.","Usually, if I hear songs, I record it on a Voice Memo first. I have to perfect it. I'm a big fan of delivery, and I want to make sure you're saying it right. I'm like, 'This has to be perfect when I do this.'","I just want to be a spokesperson for the people."],"O. Winston Link":["I was one man and I tackled a big railroad. I did the best I could.","I never expected that. I didn't aim for that. All I wanted was to get some nice pictures of trains at night.","I was strong and healthy and I was enjoying what I was doing.","You can show me some stick ice cream and I can tell you if it's good or not just looking at it."],"OMI":["It's not every day you get to do what you love and have a major story behind it.","I try to stay focused.","I'm not looking for a 'yes' woman, but a strong person who knows when to be objective and when not to be.","My mom has been my support system from day one. Admiring the type of person she is gives me a sense of what to look for in my ideal cheerleader when the time comes.","My stage name is actually my nickname given to me by my dad when I was a baby.","My father had a passion for love. It's mostly what he talked about in his songs, and I still have his old records today.","Creatively, I've always wanted to be different as it relates to my craft, and reggae, being a part of my culture, makes up a percentage of that uniqueness. The only definition I can think of to describe my style is 'OMI.'","I am not a dancehall artist, and I am not a reggae artist.","I've never hidden the fact that I'm Jamaican; I will never disown my roots or influences.","A lot of people have come with 100 songs and never had the impact that I have with one, and I'm well aware of that.","I'm really looking forward to working with Meghan Trainor because that's in the pipeline, and I'm eager for it to really happen.","I have an appreciation for everywhere I've been so far.","Fan reactions are crazy sometimes.","Fame is a distraction sometimes. You know, it's a distraction if you let it. So it's very important to stay focused, stay very connected to your roots.","We've seen many heroes from Jamaica, you know, and to be put in that class or to be looked upon on that level is overwhelming. It's pretty big shoes to fill, you know. I'm a size eight, but I'll try my best.","The quality of a timeless song is that it's catchy, meaningful and relatable.","I love hats. On tour, it's difficult to stop in at a barber. It's good to have a hat nearby.","I think everybody wants someone who understands them and is able to compromise and meet them halfway. I mean, it goes both ways, you know?","The thing about metaphors is that, if you give them away, you give away the mystery."],"Obiageli Ezekwesili":["China, frankly, can be an opportunity for Africa based on the huge infrastructure deficit on the continent, but what needs to happen is that governments and citizens have to build internal ownership of the need of good governance, transparency, accountability, for respect for the environment.","I would like to see a lot of people more involved in practical solutions to practical problems. Women have got to the point where we can turn the world upside down.","Social media is simply a tool that facilitates actions.","Do our children now have to choose between getting an education and dying? Some of us cannot move on and accept that kind of society.","There's absolutely nothing that the God I believe in cannot do.","My mum was a quintessential businesswoman. She taught me problem-solving. She can solve any problem.","I have always battled injustice. As a child, I used to fight on the side of my friends when boys terrorized them.","How can the cost of education be the cost of life? It is unacceptable; it is reprehensible that we have allowed it to fester.","What would ultimately de-escalate the challenges of society would be for people to get educated, especially for more women to be educated because when more women are educated, they invest much more of their time and income in ensuring that the next generation would perform even more than they have done.","In terms of competitiveness of new global environment, Kenya will have absolutely no choice but to tackle the most important constraint to its development: it has been corruption.","The way our government handled the Chibok girls case goes beyond an election matter. This is not a one-time issue we discuss over elections. We need to have a deeper conversation about what kind of a nation we want to be.","It is time for someone as powerful as Barack Obama to compare the girls of Chibok to his own daughters. These girls are a symbol of our own message to girls that they should be educated, that we would go beyond the call of duty for you."],"Obie Trice":["I think it need realness, you should speak on thing that you know about, that you being from, that you experienced or that you been around, you know. I think you need a good hook, good beats and good lyrics.","I just do what I'm here for and that's to make that music.","Well, Eminem, you know, I know him longer. Ive been signed to his label since 2001 and he's a good friend.","But working with Dre, I grew up with his music, so I'm still like more a fan.","Eminem is more like a friend. And I'm also a fan on Eminem.","I'm the 1st black platinum artist in Detroit, solo artist in Detroit.","You know, I'm the 1st black solo MC from Detroit. I didn't do the 50 Cent sales but hey... I got a long career, I'm still young and I'm trying to bring really good music.","I get the music, I get the beats. And I go to the studios and write the lyrics.","I'm working on my new album right now. Hopefully to get that out at the top of 2005, January 2005.","Where's Eminem, when is Em coming out, Em this, Em that, 50 this, 50 that... What about Obie?","Detroit is right now a new Mecca for Hip Hop.","Beef is beef, you know. Beef comes, so Beef is real.","I was about 11 when my mother brought me this karaoke machine and I was really into it back then, but about 4 or 5 years ago is when I started printing up my own music, going to the studio and doing my own thing.","Yeah I grew up on the Westside of Detroit.","7 Mile is like an Ave. Back in the days it was poppin' in the summer time.","I'm just going to do me; I'm not trying to do the Eminem thing, the D12 thing or the 50 thing.","I would say old school cats like Redman and Wu-tang. My style is my style, those are just cats that I liked.","I just don't want to be rapping forever. I love it, but sometimes you got goals for yourself.","I want to get off with the screenwriting.","I don't want to be an actor or nothing but if I have to, I'll act if it's the right thing.","I don't actually sit down and write, but I just have a lot of different ideas about films and making movies.","The Anger Management Tour was another beautiful thing. I loved that tour.","Working with 50 Cent was great, you know what Im saying? It was just great to work with 50 Cent.","Downloading songs is not good.","Let's say I was a plumber, or I worked at a factory, I would download music, you feel what I'm saying?","But since I am in the music industry, I don't want anyone to download music, not on September 9th."],"Octave Mirbeau":["The greatest danger of bombs is in the explosion of stupidity that they provoke.","Murder is born of love, and love attains the greatest intensity in murder.","When one tears away the veils and shows them naked, people's souls give off such a pungent smell of decay."],"Octavia Butler":["Sometimes being a friend means mastering the art of timing. There is a time for silence. A time to let go and allow people to hurl themselves into their own destiny. And a time to prepare to pick up the pieces when it's all over.","I was attracted to science fiction because it was so wide open. I was able to do anything and there were no walls to hem you in and there was no human condition that you were stopped from examining.","I have a huge and savage conscience that won't let me get away with things.","People have the right to call themselves whatever they like. That doesn't bother me. It's other people doing the calling that bothers me.","No, I think the future of humanity will be like the past, we'll do what we've always done and there will still be human beings. Granted, there will always be people doing something different and there are a lot of possibilities.","Writing is one of the few professions in which you can psychoanalyse yourself, get rid of hostilities and frustrations in public, and get paid for it.","I wasn't trying to work out my own ancestry. I was trying to get people to feel slavery. I was trying to get across the kind of emotional and psychological stones that slavery threw at people.","I was raised Baptist, and I like the fact that I got my conscience installed early.","Science fiction let me do both. It let me look into science and stick my nose in everywhere.","No... a novel is a long business. I'm a slow writer, even when I'm doing very well I write slowly.","What I'm working on now - I'm back to fantasy, although considering that it's me, I'm turning it into a kind of science fantasy. It's a vampire story - but my vampires are biological vampires. They didn't become vampires because someone bit them; they were born that way.","You don't start out writing good stuff. You start out writing crap and thinking it's good stuff, and then gradually you get better at it. That's why I say one of the most valuable traits is persistence.","Religion kept some of my relatives alive, because it was all they had. If they hadn't had some hope of heaven, some companionship in Jesus, they probably would have committed suicide, their lives were so hellish.","Fantasy is totally wide open; all you really have to do is follow the rules you've set. But if you're writing about science, you have to first learn what you're writing about.","And I have this little litany of things they can do. And the first one, of course, is to write - every day, no excuses. It's so easy to make excuses. Even professional writers have days when they'd rather clean the toilet than do the writing.","While Fledging is a different type of book, The Parable series serve as cautionary tales. I wrote the Parable books because of the direction of the country. You can call it save the world fiction, but it clearly doesn't save anything.","I recognize we will pay more attention when we have different leadership.","I would never have been a good scientist - my attention span was too short for that.","And by the way, I wanted to point out that Kindred is not science fiction. You'll note there's no science in it. It's a kind of grim fantasy.","But my problem with fantasy, and horror, and related genres, is that sometimes the problems are illogical.","I began reading science fiction before I was 12 and started writing science fiction around the same time.","I just knew there were stories I wanted to tell.","Once you grow past Mommy and Daddy coming running when you're hurt, you're really on your own. You're alone, and there's no one to help you.","The thing about science fiction is that it's totally wide open. But it's wide open in a conditional way.","Well, writing was what I wanted to do, it was always what I wanted to do. I had novels to write so I wrote them.","Here I was into astronomy, and here into anthropology, and there I go into geology. It was much more fun to be able to research and write about whatever I wanted to.","No one was going to stop me from writing and no one had to really guide me towards science fiction. It was natural, really, that I would take that interest.","On the other hand, I was very much interested in the way people behaved, the human dance, how they seemed to move around each other. I wanted to play around with that.","So fantasy was fine early on, and when I discovered science fiction, I was very happy with it, because my first interest in science fiction came with an interest in astronomy.","A workshop is a way of renting an audience, and making sure you're communicating what you think you're communicating. It's so easy as a young writer to think you're been very clear when in fact you haven't.","I talked to members of my family, and did some personal research that didn't really have anything to do with the time and place I was writing about, but that gave me a feeling of the experience of being black in a time and place where it was very difficult to be black.","Most of us don't have to worry about being shot if we poke our noses outside. So we are comfortable, but the people I'm writing about are definitely not comfortable, and being shot while they're still inside is a good possibility.","Third, for people who aren't doing it already, take classes - they're worthwhile. Workshops or classes - a workshop is where you do actually get feedback on your work, not just something where you go and sit for a day."],"Octavia E. Butler":["Not everyone has been a bully or the victim of bullies, but everyone has seen bullying, and seeing it, has responded to it by joining in or objecting, by laughing or keeping silent, by feeling disgusted or feeling interested.","When I was 7 and went to the zoo with my second-grade class, I saw chimpanzee eyes for the first time - the eyes of an unhappy animal, all alone, locked in a bare, concrete-floored, iron-barred cage in one of the nastier, old-fashioned zoos. I remember looking at the chimp, then looking away.","Every story I create, creates me. I write to create myself.","The major tragedies in life, there's just no compensation. But the minor ones you can always write about. It's my way of dealing, and it's a heck of a lot cheaper than psychiatrists. The story, you see, will get you through.","If vampires were a separate species, and they were into genetic engineering, what would they engineer for?","Simple peck-order bullying is only the beginning of the kind of hierarchical behavior that can lead to racism, sexism, ethnocentrism, classism, and all the other 'isms' that cause so much suffering in the world.","People who think about time travel stories sometimes think that going back in time would be fun because you would have all the information you needed to be much more astute than the people there, when the truth is of course you wouldn't.","A 10-pound sack of potatoes lasts a long time.","At school I was always taller than the rest of my class, and because I was an only child, I was comfortable with adults but shy and awkward with other kids. I was quiet, bookish, and in spite of my size, hopeless at sports. In short, I was different. And even in the earliest grades, I got pounded for it.","I'm comfortably asocial - a hermit in the middle of a large city, a pessimist if I'm not careful, a feminist, a black, a former Baptist, an oil-and-water combination of ambition, laziness, insecurity, certainty and drive.","My race and sex had a great deal more to do with what people believed I could do than with what I actually could do.","The big talent is persistence.","The norm is white, apparently, in the view of people who see things in that way. For them, the only reason you would introduce a black character is to introduce this kind of abnormality. Usually, it's because you're telling a story about racism or at least about race.","Delusional pain hurts just as much as pain from actual trauma. So what if it's all in your head?","I wanted to write a novel that would make others feel the history: the pain and fear that black people have had to live through in order to endure.","Tolerance, like any aspect of peace, is forever a work in progress, never completed, and, if we're as intelligent as we like to think we are, never abandoned.","Sometimes being a friend means mastering the art of timing. There is a time for silence. A time to let go and allow people to hurl themselves into their own destiny. And a time to prepare to pick up the pieces when it's all over.","The lovely thing about writing is, well, two things. One, writing fiction allows us to bring an order to our lives that doesn't exist in real life. And two, it allows us to create human characters that we know better than we will ever know anyone in real life.","Beware, all too often we say what we hear others say. We think what we are told that we think. We see what we are permitted to see. Worse, we see what we are told that we see.","Too many writers get into that gross-'em-out factor.","Science fiction frees you to go anyplace and examine anything.","Science fiction is not formulaic.","Movies are extremely imitative of one another. Whatever works, people will try to do it.","How dull it is to have people defining you.","I don't write about good and evil with this enormous dichotomy. I write about people. I write about people doing the kinds of things that people do.","I used to give up writing like some people would give up smoking.","I think people really need to think what it's like to have all of society arrayed against you.","Writing has been as difficult for me as for people who don't like to write and as little fun.","I had novels to write, so I wrote them.","I learned that five- and-six-year-old kids have already figured out how to be intolerant.","I think we need people with stronger ideals than John Kerry or Bill Clinton. I think we need people with more courage and vision.","I had a long period of writing what I think of as 'save the world' novels. 'Fledgling' was a chance to play.","I pecked my stories out two-fingered on the Remington portable typewriter my mother had bought me. I had begged for it when I was ten.","I took classes taught by an elderly woman who wrote children's stories. She was polite about the science fiction and fantasy that I kept handing in, but she finally asked in exasperation, 'Can't you write anything normal?'","My characters hope for better lives.","I'm very happy alone.","We are a naturally hierarchical species.","Most of us, if we're not careful, tend to dehumanize the enemy.","Every story I write adds to me a little, changes me a little, forces me to reexamine an attitude or belief, causes me to research and learn, helps me to understand people and grow.","Science fiction, extrasensory perception, and black people are judged by the worst elements they produce.","Hollywood wants to go for the flash, because that's what a lot of them think science fiction is.","I don't know how much of a market there is for space opera. Just because it's in the movies doesn't mean magazines are buying it.","Getting your writing criticized can be a lot like getting skinned, and you respond to it just as enthusiastically.","In countries where there are no racial differences or no religious differences, people find other reasons to set aside one certain group of people and generally spit in their direction.","As a black and as a woman, I didn't think that I would really want to live in any of the eras before this, because I would inevitably be worse off. I would have spent more time struggling just to prove I was human than doing my work.","I'm not pessimistic about much of anything.","With a disaster like global warming, it's too late to worry about when it's looming except to figure out how to adapt to it.","When I was between 2 and 3 years old, I got to know my first non-human being. The non-human was a cocker spaniel named Baba. We weren't friends, Baba and I, nor enemies. He wasn't my dog. He belonged to the people my mother worked for, and he lived in the house with them and us.","Several years ago, when I was about to start a novel, I thought I might get some mileage out of the idea of a civilization in which people somehow felt - that is, they shared - all the pain and all the pleasure they caused one another.","Most vampires I have discovered are men for some reason. I guess it's because of Dracula; people are kind of feeding off that.","Religion is everywhere. There are no human societies without it, whether they acknowledge it as a religion or not."],"Octavia Spencer":["You cannot live to please everyone else. You have to edify, educate and fulfill your own dreams and destiny, and hope that whatever your art is that you're putting out there, if it's received, great, I respect you for receiving it. If it's not received, great, I respect you for not.","We all have hourglass figures; your sand just settles in different places.","The way to bring about change is to be proactive and active.","You just keep moving forward and doing what you do and hope that it resonates with people. And if it doesn't, you just keep moving on until you find a project that does.","If you go through life, and you don't find the beauty in an unexpected place, then you really have a sad existence.","I think if I weren't so squeamish, I would have been some sort of forensic analyst. And I can't do anything with a microscope, because then I start thinking about the world of germs around us.","Tough love is the hardest to give.","I'm not an optimist. I'm a realist. And my reality is that we live in a multifaceted, multicultural world. And maybe once we stop labeling ourselves, then maybe everyone else will.","You have to get out of your comfort zone in order to grow. And as an actor, you don't become Meryl Streep by doing the same type of comedy. You get there by being challenged. And unfortunately, there's a lack of roles for women of color, so you actually have to be the engineer creating some of those roles.","Be happy in your own skin.","What surprised me about the Oscars was how familiar it was - because you're in the room with all these people that have inspired you from your childhood to adulthood in the film industry. It feels like you've known them all of your life.","Weight issues, race issues will always be there and if you allow them to get to you and you allow them to affect you then yes they affect you. But my thing is I have so many other things to worry about I can't worry about other people's perception of me.","I hope that in some way that I can be some sort of beacon of hope, especially because I am not the typical Hollywood beauty.","I think that young women and little girls need to see that they don't have to be the damsel in distress. They don't have to not show their strength. They don't have to be whatever the stereotype is or the tropes that we go to in our minds.","Every day that I live, I try to find the beauty in things.","The most I like about cooking is eating what someone else has cooked.","If a little black girl in Montgomery, Alabama, or some far-reaching region sees something that I do and aspires to do it one day with the knowledge that she can achieve it, then hey, my work is done.","The hardest thing about writing, for me, is facing the blank page.","I want to be proactive in bringing about change and enlightening people.","You have to create your own path and I'm up to the challenge.","Life is too short, and I need to eat. I am my meanest when I haven't had a meal.","I have an affinity for the law. I like looking at the small type on contracts, and if I could have afforded law school, I probably would have gone.","Christian Louboutin, I love you, but honey, please! But when you have this much weight, you've got to give us a little platform. Sorry! The shoes are stunning though. An ounce of pain, it's worth it.","I don't think there will ever be a time I don't write, and I hope there will never be a time I don't act.","If you come out of the gate with a finger pointed, then you really aren't opening the door to any sort of resolution to whatever the problem may be. Whether it's about race or sexual orientation or religion, if you can't empathize with the opposing party, then you can't really meet in the middle.","The thing about the South is we accept our history. We don't push it under the rug.","As you make your way along life's tumultuous highways, it's important to note that you should always carry a map, have plenty of fuel in the tank, and take frequent rest stops.","I think my role, I want to have a presence both behind the scenes and in front of the camera. So I can't say on one particular thing, so I'll just name them all. I'll be the jack of all trades and hopefully decent at one of them.","The first time I saw E.T., the actual image of an alien, and he was so sweet-looking. I wanted him. I wanted E.T.","You know, bigotry isn't relevant to just the South. It never was. But I'm very grateful that I don't know what it's like from experience.","Meeting Oprah Winfrey, I cried like a baby. Meeting Steven Spielberg, I cried like a baby. Meeting Denzel Washington, I gushed like a crazy woman. If I don't get excited or star struck by someone I've been dying to meet, it's time to retire.","I'm not trying to be a different weight. I want to be a different body type so that I'm not an apple. I just want to be a pear!","The reality is that there are so few roles out there for women and for women of color, and I'm a character actor, this I know. And I'm getting to see more of the roles that are out there, but there aren't many. And zilch have been studio movies. Zilch.","What I love about Tadashi is that he isn't a designer that designs only for a double-zero. He designs for double-Ds, you know? Women of all shapes and sizes can wear him.","I think it's actually a misperception that I am a comedic actress. I do more drama than comedy but very little of it has been seen. When you are in big funny movies and they do well and your little part in it kind of explodes people perceive you as a comedian.","Let's just say that I have a tendency if I am uncomfortable in a situation to speak my mind.","We as women have a voice and we are decision makers in what film to see. We always support our boyfriends and husbands by going to see the male dominated films, but we don't compel them to see films with female casts.","Civil rights happened because youth got involved. The youth stood up and helped to break the pattern that their parents had got accustomed to living. The next generation has to take that stand for whatever it is, socially, that they are involved in.","I was a production assistant. I saw what people who are full of themselves are like - another reason not to lose your humility! I have a mouth on me so I wasn't the best P.A.","I like a person who knows how to say something dark at a very dark moment. The darker the moment and the darker the comic, the better. Something that is so wrong on all levels.","I'm an Oscar nominee. I love saying that. Whatever happens, I'm going to sing that 'I'm an Oscar nominee' part.","I prefer doing interviews where people don't have to interpret what you say. I'm going to be real honest.","I'm probably the most militant person you'll ever meet and I speak my mind without provocation sometimes.","I'm not a fan of 'Gone With the Wind.' I didn't like the movie. I didn't like the book.","I just think that you have to believe in yourself and you have to work very hard. You can't ever think that you're the best thing since sliced bread because I promise you, there are going to be Viola Davises and Jessica Chastains and Emma Stones who are the best thing since sliced bread. So take it seriously, but don't take it too seriously.","I don't have one role that I want to play. I guess... I want to be a producer. I want to be an activist. I want to be proactive in bringing about work for men, women, boys, girls, everybody who is good at what they do and deserve a shot at it.","As we women know, there are so many other hurdles that we have to cross that I would love it if we could stop having the race conversation so that we can get women further on. You know, a female president now that we have an African American president. Maybe we can get an Asian female, a gay person?","The fact that women are very young in obtaining their civil rights and African-Americans are young in obtaining their civil rights, I think it's about time that we extend that to all Americans, whether straight, gay, purple, green, black, brown.","To be silent is to be passive.","I was always a closet lover of acting. My mom was very practical. She never, ever restricted our dreams, always told us we could do or be anything. Then I said, 'Maybe I want to be an actor'. And she said, 'Maybe not that'.","I'll say that I don't think you can throw a stone and not come in contact with someone who knows someone or has problems with substance abuse.","I'm a woman who eventually will get married and have kids - adopted at this point - but I see myself with a family and less time to commit to wanting to be a lead character.","It's been pretty effortless with Sensa because I am not thinking about how long do I need to do this. Usually, when you stop a diet program, you lose control again. But I don't need to stop what I'm doing. I'm eating everything that I like. Sensa just helps me keep it all in check.","I have tried every diet to lose weight. When you restrict yourself, you're setting yourself up for failure.","When you see results, you start to wonder, 'What would happen if I had oatmeal instead of sausage for breakfast?' You start to eat better because you feel better.","People think that I have this wonderful hourglass figure, but I owe that to designer Tadashi Shoji because he cuts for me really well.","I am an advocate of education. It is the panacea for all that ails us in our society.","I think if we give kids a break in education, we would have fewer crimes being committed. If we keep them on track, they know that they have options. It's important for me because, you know, my life would've been different had I not had the education that I had.","The college years are when you sow all your wild oats and become a vampire. By 40, you've lived it up. At least, you hope.","I've seen too many sunrises, as far as the walk of shame, staying out too late doing very bad things.","I love working with kids and seeing the light come on when they realize they are smart. It's so beautiful to watch.","City Year resonated with me because when I grew up, we were poor - and an education is a way out of poverty. It's a way out of the current situation that can seem isolating and hopeless for some kids.","When you give kids the tools necessary to change their destiny, it's really empowering.","If you tell me I can't eat something, I'll obsess over it and end up overeating!","My weight has always been a struggle for me.","I know I'm never going to be one of those size 2 actresses - that's just not me. But I do want to be the healthiest I can be, and a role model to women of all shapes and sizes.","I think success happens when it's supposed to and when you can appreciate it. I am grateful that it didn't happen for me at 22 or 23. I would've been foolish enough to think that we're all entitled to it, instead of it being the divine blessing that it is.","The mentality of how we treat one another needs to be examined - especially how we treat our men of color.","As a kid, I was always very thin, and I kind of didn't know that I was skinny.","I gravitate to whatever looks good on me and whatever maakes me feel sexy.","I should be married and have 19 kids. And now I'm thinking my eggs are dying on the shelf. They're going to go past their expiration date. But it's what I chose, so I'm fine with that decision.","If you are unhealthy, start by making small changes to become healthier. You are unique, beautiful, and worthy.","I feel for the overly thin women as I do for the overweight women.","If more women ate, they would be a lot happier. Let me tell you, I am a lot grumpier when I don't eat.","I'm reading today because of 'Encyclopedia Brown.'","I wanted to write about the things that I love.","I am not maternal at all. I don't have any kids.","When we don't have all the details about our characters, we have to make it up to fill in all the details. So, for me, writing and acting go hand in hand."],"Octavian Paler":["The post-totalitarian malady has taken its most acute form in Romania. And it has taken place for very specific reasons. The repression here has been more cruel, more brutal, than in other states caught in the inferno of a 'socialist paradise.'","The statues of Lenin and Stalin are down, but the fight against their ghosts seems harder.","After the fall of dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, Romanians were crazed with happiness. People who never met each other before hugged each other in the streets - convinced that tomorrow things would look different. Then came the many disappointments."],"Octavio Paz":["When hypocrisy is a character trait, it also affects one's thinking, because it consists in the negation of all the aspects of reality that one finds disagreeable, irrational or repugnant.","Deserve your dream.","Literature is the expression of a feeling of deprivation, a recourse against a sense of something missing. But the contrary is also true: language is what makes us human. It is a recourse against the meaningless noise and silence of nature and history.","I think we all have our own personality, unique and distinctive, and at the same time, I think that our own unique and distinctive personality blends with the wind, with the footsteps in the street, with the noises around the corner, and with the silence of memory, which is the great producer of ghosts.","Picasso is what is going to happen and what is happening; he is posterity and archaic time, the distant ancestor and our next-door neighbor. Speed permits him to be two places at once, to belong to all the centuries without letting go of the here and now.","Self-discovery is above all the realization that we are alone: it is the opening of an impalpable, transparent wall - that of our consciousness - between the world and ourselves.","Wisdom lies neither in fixity nor in change, but in the dialectic between the two.","The truth is that the history of Mexico is a history in the image of its geography: abrupt and tortuous. Each historical period is like a plateau surrounded by tall mountains and separated from the other plateaus by precipices and divides.","To read a poem is to hear it with our eyes; to hear it is to see it with our ears.","If contemporary artists sincerely seek to be original, unique, and new, they should begin by disregarding the notions of originality, individuality, and innovation: they are the cliches of our time.","The minority of Mexicans who are aware of their own selves do not make up a closed or unchanging class. They are the only active group, in comparison with the Indian-Spanish inertia of the rest, and ever day they are shaping the country more and more into their own image.","Man does not speak because he thinks; he thinks because he speaks. Or rather, speaking is no different than thinking: to speak is to think.","Wit invents; inspiration reveals. The inventions of wit are conceits - metaphors and paradoxes - that discover the secret correspondences that unite beings and things among and with themselves; inspiration is condemned to dissipate its revelations - unless a form can be found to contain them.","Perhaps things are not things but words: metaphors, words for other things.","We are condemned to kill time, thus we die bit by bit.","Abstract painting seeks to be a pure pictorial language, and thus attempts to escape the essential impurity of all languages: the recourse to signs or forms that have meanings shared by everyone.","In antiquity, a woman might be an object of worship or desire, but never of love.","The characteristic feature of modernity is criticism: what is new is set over and against what is old, and it is this constant contrast that constitutes the continuity of tradition.","Despite the often illusory nature of essays on the psychology of a nation, it seems to me there is something revealing in the insistence with which a people will question itself during certain periods of its growth.","As it defines itself, every society defines other societies. That definition almost always takes the form of a condemnation: the 'other' is the barbarian.","Poetry, whatever the manifest content of the poem, is always a violation of the rationalism and morality of bourgeois society.","For a man of my generation, our century has been a long intellectual and political struggle in favor of freedom.","We twentieth-century Mexicans, even those of pure Indian descent, look on the pre-Columbian world as a world on the other side, not only distant in time but across the cultural divide.","The relations between rhetoric and ethics are disturbing: the ease with which language can be twisted is worrisome, and the fact that our minds accept these perverse games so docilely is no less cause for concern.","The sound of water is worth more than all the poets' words.","A work survives its readers; after a hundred or two hundred years, it is read by new readers who impose on it new modes of reading and interpretation. The work survives because of these interpretations, which are, in fact, resurrections: without them, there would be no work.","A society is defined as much by how it comes to terms with its past as by its attitude toward the future: its memories are no less revealing than its aims.","What distinguishes modern art from the art of other ages is criticism.","Surrealism is not a poetry but a poetics, and even more, and more decisively, a world vision.","Solitude is the profoundest fact of the human condition. Man is the only being who knows he is alone.","To be a great painter means to be a great poet: someone who transcends the limits of his language.","All poems say the same thing, and each poem is unique. Each part reproduces the others, and each part is different.","In the United States, man does not feel that he has been torn from the center of creation and suspended between hostile forces. He has built his own world, and it is built in his own image: it is his mirror. But now he cannot recognize himself in his inhuman objects, nor in his fellows.","Literatures, like trees and plants, are born of a land and in it flourish and die. But literatures, also like plants, may be carried abroad to take root in a foreign soil.","To us, the value of a work lies in its newness: the invention of new forms, or a novel combination of old forms, the discovery of unknown worlds or the exploration of unfamiliar areas in worlds already discovered - revelations, surprises.","The modern tradition is the tradition of revolt. The French Revolution is still our model today: history is violent change, and this change goes by the name of progress. I do not know whether these notions really apply to art.","If we are a metaphor of the universe, the human couple is the metaphor par excellence, the point of intersection of all forces and the seed of all forms. The couple is time recaptured, the return to the time before time.","The world stretches before me, the vast world of the big, the little, and the medium.","The Mexican succumbs very easily to sentimental effusions, and therefore he shuns them.","Man is alone everywhere. But the solitude of the Mexican, under the great stone night of the high plateau that is still inhabited by insatiable gods, is very different from that of the North American, who wanders in an abstract world of machines, fellow citizens and moral precepts.","No one is alone, and each change here brings about another change there.","We go along, without a fixed itinerary, yet at the same time with an end (what end?) in mind, and with the aim of reaching the end. A search for the end, a dread of the end: the obverse and the reverse of the same act.","Technology is neutral and sterile. Now, technology is the nature of modern man; it is our environment and our horizon. Of course, every work of man is a negation of nature, but at the same time, it is a bridge between nature and us. Technology changes nature in a more radical and decisive manner: it throws it out.","Human writing reflects that of the universe; it is its translation, but also its metaphor: it says something totally different, and it says the same thing.","Little by little, not without astonishment, I rediscovered the great names of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, who had been the master thinkers of my grandfather and other Mexican liberals. They did no offer me a doctrine or a catechism: they were and they are a source, an inspiration.","The work of art is always unfaithful to its creator... Art lays at a higher level; it says something more, and almost always, it says something different from what the artist wanted to say.","Yes, I am well aware that nature - or what we call nature: that totality of objects and processes that surrounds us and that alternately creates us and devours us - is neither our accomplice nor our confidant.","It is not proper to project our feelings onto things or to attribute our own sensations and passions to them. Can it also be improper to see in them a guide, a way of life?","Walt Whitman is the only great modern poet who does not seem to experience discord when he faces his world. Not even solitude - his monologue is a universal chorus.","Words are things, but things which mean. We cannot do away with meaning without doing away with signs, that is, with language itself. Moreover, we would have to do away with the universe. All the things man touches are impregnated with meaning.","Art is an invention of aesthetics, which in turn is an invention of philosophers... What we call art is a game.","Writers, you know, are the beggars of Western society.","Love is an attempt at penetrating another being, but it can only succeed if the surrender is mutual.","One of the most notable traits of the Mexican's character is his willingness to contemplate horror: he is even familiar and complacent in his dealings with it.","Man, it seems to me, is not in history: he is history.","The idea of modernity is beginning to lose its vitality. It is losing it because modernity is no longer a critical attitude but an accepted, codified convention.","In the works of Duchamp, space begins to walk and take on form; it becomes a machine that spins arguments and philosophizes; it resists movement with delay and delay with irony.","Futurists wanted to suggest movement by means of a dynamic painting; Duchamp applies the notion of delay - or, rather, or analysis - to movement.","For the Chinese, the Greeks, the Mayans, or the Egyptians, nature was a living totality, a creative being. For this reason, art, according to Aristotle, is imitation; the poet imitates the creative gesture of nature.","Wisdom lies neither in fixity nor in change, but in the dialectic between the two. A constant coming and going: wisdom lies in the momentary.","Fixity is always momentary. But how can it always be so? If it were, it would not be momentary - or would not be fixity.","Poems - crystallizations of the universal play of analogy, transparent objects which, as they reproduce the mechanism and the rotary motion of analogy, are waterspouts of new analogies.","Poetry is the experience of liberty. The poet risks himself, chances all on the poem's all with each verse he writes.","In order for sensation to accede to the objectivity of things, it must itself be changed into a thing. The agent of change is language: the sensations are turned into verbal objects.","Even though the society that Marx foresaw is far from being an historical reality, Marxism has penetrated so deeply in history that we are all Marxists, one way or another, even unknowingly.","Art for Duchamp, all the arts, obey the same law: meta-irony is inherent in their very spirit. It is an irony that destroys its own negation and, hence, returns in the affirmative.","Social criticism begins with grammar and the re-establishing of meanings.","All of us, at some moment, have had a vision of our existence as something unique, untransferable and very precious. This revelation almost always takes place during adolescence.","The object of poetic activity is essentially language: whatever his beliefs and convictions, the poet is more concerned with words than with what these words designate.","To the poet fated to be a poet, self-expression is as natural and as involuntary as breathing is to us ordinary mortals.","Changes in our aesthetic tastes have no value or meaning in and of themselves; what has value and meaning is the idea of change itself. Or, better stated: not change in and of itself, but change as an agent or inspiration of modern creations.","In each verse, a decision awaits us, and we can't choose to close our eyes and let instinct work on its own. Poetic instinct consists of an alert tension.","The presence and the present of America are a future; our continent is, by its nature, the land which does not exist on its own, but as something which is created and invented.","The American War of Independence is the expulsion of the intrusive elements, alien to the American essence. If American reality is the reinvention of itself, whatever is found in any way irreducible or unassimilable is not American.","Sensation is amphibious: at the same time it joins us to and divides us from things. It is the door through which we enter into things but also through which we come out of them and realize that we are not things.","It has always surprised me that in a world of relations as hard as that of the United States, cordiality constantly springs out like water from an unstanchable fountain.","An unread author is an author who is a victim of the worst kind of censorship, indifference - a censorship more effective than the Ecclesiastical Index.","Poetry is not a genre in harmony with the modern world; its innermost nature is hostile or indifferent to the dogmas of modern times, progress and the cult of the future.","An understanding of Sor Juana's work must include an understanding of the prohibitions her work confronts. Her speech leads us to what cannot be said, what cannot be said to an orthodoxy, the orthodoxy to a tribunal, and the tribunal to a sentence.","Any reflection about poetry should begin, or end, with this question: who and how many read poetry books?","Our judgment and moral categories, our idea of the future, our opinions about the present or about justice, peace, or war, everything, without excluding our rejections of Marxism, is impregnated with Marxism."],"Oded Fehr":["I am not thinking that because people say I am great that I really am great. I am just doing a job, just like everybody else. The only difference is that a lot more people see what I do.","I did my military service from 1989 - 92 and I was never shot at or had to fire on anybody. I was very lucky. I was more involved in intelligence and counter-intelligence.","I never got hurt when I was in Morocco doing all the horse riding and my own stunts. But on the last day on the last shot I slid off my horse and landed on my bottom. I did not get hurt but it was very embarrassing.","I think I value things more correctly. I hope I look at my life in a way that makes sense.","I think if you play a character that is fearless, then it's boring. I think that's what was so incredible about Harrison Ford, is that he always seemed like he was never going to survive it, he's always scared, and yet he always does survive it somehow.","The things I learned from the army - and I think it was a lesson for life - was how to work in unison with other people. How to take responsibility."],"Odell Beckham, Jr.":["Just find what works for you, what style suits you best, and just be confident enough to rock it.","Football is my sanctuary.

You get knocked down, and you get back up. That's just always been my mentality. I'm not really fazed by anything. It's in the past. There's nothing I can really do about it now.

I don't like to lose.","I hate losing. Whether it's marbles, spades, blackjack, whatever it is.","I've made mistakes. Like, bringing people to your level who don't deserve to be there. They're trying to bite off your so-called fame, make a name off of you. I think I did a lot of that - allowed people to be relevant in my life who really aren't relevant to me at all.","I get these weird divine feelings.

I've given people second chances. You have fall-outs with friends, and forgiveness is a great thing to have. It's not easy to forgive. I definitely don't forget, but I do forgive.","I'm obsessed with socks. I even wear them to bed!","Hiking is something that I really, really like to do. It's distracting, you're in nature, and you get a nice workout that way. I would tell everyone to hike as much as they can - you just feel so much better when you get outdoors. I'm also into yoga.","I think everyone should live in New York City if they ever get the chance at least once in their life. It's such a great place to live; there's a different energy about living in the city.","My first audition happened to be for 'Kindergarten Cop,' and I took that role. I was only starting to learn English at that point. Spanish is my first language, so they made me a speaking character in the movie. I didn't really know I was shooting a movie. I was just having a lot of fun with 30 kids my own age.","I'm Cuban, so I like a bit of curve. I just want my booty to have a little lift!","I learned Spanish at home and, since half my family doesn't speak English, it's my first language.","I had a great time in high school. I really did. I went to a private Christian high school and I graduated in a class of 67 kids, so it was pretty small, and I knew and loved everybody.","If you ever were bullied, you'll always remember that feeling.","I had always wanted to lend my voice to a character. I did a voice for this video game, called 'Fallout 3,' and that was really fun.","I can't even be around children. It's a problem. My ovaries start screaming.","Richard Gere's got this very old-school Hollywood charm. He has a presence that when he's in a room you just feel him. I mean, I'm married, but he's sexy!","I did a voice for this video game called 'Fallout 3,' and that was really fun. I had a great time, especially since I could show up in PJs and not have to worry about how I looked.","'The Exorcist' is absolutely my favorite horror film, and I watched it when I was, like, seven years old with my mother for the first time. I don't know why my mom let me watch that. I couldn't go to the bathroom by myself. I couldn't go upstairs by myself. I couldn't sleep.","I just love scary movies. I love the thrill.","I love all sorts of music. I'm really into Damian Rice and Amos Lee.","Rihanna is always on my playlist. I think she pumps you up and gets the day going. I also love - and I know this doesn't sound like a workout album - the Lumineers, lately, and Taylor Swift.","I'm kind of in between organized and messy, so if I have the right things to keep me organized, it's easier for me to stay that way. If I don't have the right tools, I'm a train wreck.","I'm kind of a crazy person about hand sanitizer. I carry the plain ones that smell like aloe, from Target or CVS.","I think I'm pretty fearless. I like to try things at least once, things that I never thought that I would try.","I used to try to pick locks because I grew up on my grandparents' farm and I started my own little spy club. I would go around the farm and try to break into the shed and try spying on my grandpa. It was ridiculous.","I'm Latin, for crying out loud - I can't hold anything back!","I have superfine, superoily hair, so my struggle is always trying to get the volume I want. I end up not doing much with it ever.","If women just got into it a little more, then the world would be happier. Instead of stabbing each other behind the back, just get into a fight, and then everything is out in the open.","Beauty is what attracts men naturally, but really I think we dress for other women, not necessarily for men. We torture ourselves every single day, and I wish that we wouldn't because we should all just get along, really.","Betty White is a riot. She is a good time! That is the bottom line: Betty White is a good time. She is really an incredible woman. She is so kind. She doesn't have one mean bone in her body, and she is the funniest woman in the room always. And you'll never hear one complaint from her.","When you're shooting a movie, it's two months of your life usually. You don't really have time to see anybody else. Your friends are put on hold while you're shooting, and what you have is the family that you create on set.","When you're bullied in high school, even if it's the smallest amount, or you're actually tortured, I feel like everybody carries that with them. They always think of that one person who treated them badly in high school.","I have some girls who I look back on and I think, 'Wow, they were really horrible to me.' I would love an apology from a few girls, but whatever. I'm not holding any grudges. I'm over it."],"Odeya Rush":["Whenever I look at a baby or children in general, I smile and just want to play with them.","I've always performed. I've done plays at home.","When I came to America, I told my dad I wanted to be an actress.","I didn't act in Israel, but I wrote plays at home and acted in plays at school. I tried to get an agent when I was 12, but they told me that I had too much of an accent.","Ever since I was younger, I would make table reads at home where I would give fake interviews.","A lot of movies that come from Israel are about war, but there is such good, funny, rounded writing that comes from the country that I wish more people would discover.","In Israel, if a person doesn't agree with you, she just says no. In Alabama, someone would say, 'I'll think about it.' We would take that literally. So, if you ask for a favor and someone says they'll think about it, they're really not thinking about it.","Everyone asks me if I'm the princess or if my brothers beat me up.

But we need to do a lot of marketing in order to regain market leadership. I have no doubt that we will do that, even if it takes time.","I am certain that Gadi Lesin's abilities and the experience he accumulated during his sixteen years in a variety of general management roles in Strauss Group in and outside of Israel will enable him, together with group management and all managers and employees of Strauss, to continue to take the group forward to further success.","Mutual investments of Israeli and American companies strengthen economic ties between the two countries and contribute to Israel and to the U.S. alike.","Women's inclusion in the economy is one of the most important issues in Israel.","In every country I visit, I am proud to present Jasmine and what we are doing here. I am in no doubt that we will soon be called upon to teach others the model we have been developing for the past decade, for the promotion of women-owned businesses.","I was given the opportunity to run a business, but on that very same day, I understood that it comes with a lot of responsibility, and responsibility comes at a price.","It is important that we women use our position as a platform to influence for good.","I am meeting Diaspora Jews all the time, and we are developing programmes to prevent distancing. We have a joint history, but we cannot take matters for granted. Israel is home for all of us, and part of the beauty of the country is its social diversity.","Money does not buy anyone the right to tell Israel what to do, but long-term involvement, dialogue, and care demand that we must listen.","Not listening to people who care about you, not to be open or transparent, will make you isolated.","The business case for diverse employment is not a matter we can ignore.

I wasn't supposed to make it out of the orphanage.","When I ski, I take both of my legs off and get into a sit ski: a ski with a custom seat that has been molded for me. I use my core and arms to propel myself on snow with help from ski poles.","The biggest challenge during competition is keeping my real legs warm with clothing, because I have poor circulation in the tissue around the amputated areas.","It's extremely important for my sit ski to be perfectly fit to me. If it's too big, and I shift around, the energy and strength I put into propelling myself forward will be lost. The right fit is everything in my sport.","I wear my prosthetics legs every day, and when I train in the gym, I call them my Lamborghini, because both legs and sockets, which extend up to my hips to keep the legs on via a suction seal, cost about $305,815.","With cycling, I can still be active and compete, and ultimately, that's what I love to do, to be competitive.","Time trialing is one of those things that you've got to train for...

Even though you are in prime shape, you feel like you have never worked out a day in your life.","I can go days without eating if I don't think about food. Your mind, to protect itself, learns not to pay attention to that hunger feeling.","Growing up in a very poor orphanage in Ukraine, there wasn't much food.","I was born with legs, but they were so deformed.","Cycling's primarily a pushing motion, and skiing is more pulling, so it kind of balances out the body.","My hair is super fine, so I love using Batiste Dry Shampoo to give it volume after I shower and dry my hair. It also gives me extra body and texture for when I choose to wear my hair in a French braid.","I usually like to keep my hair and makeup routines pretty simple after I work out but always need a little bit of mascara to finish off the look. I just swipe some on and then am good to go for the rest of the day.","I am very lucky to be living my dream.","Sport has definitely been an outlet for me.","Just keep moving forward.","Sports were a way for me to get comfortable with my body. I learned to appreciate everything I could still do.","When you're using your upper body to live, you get to know how to move every muscle.","In 2012, I was invited to a ski event called the Hartford Ski Spectacular to learn how to sit-ski for the first time.

I want to prove that.","They said if I stayed in the orphanage for another month or so, I basically would not have been able to be alive.","I was a super active kid, so I've always been aware of where my body is in space, and I think when I had my legs amputated, it makes you more aware of your body, and because I don't use my legs, I use more of my hands.","I definitely went through a period where I don't want to say I hated myself, but I hated what I saw in the mirror. I would try to cover it up, and it wasn't until I started doing sports - until after London 2012 - that I kind of started getting more of that confidence in my body and appreciating my body.","I definitely did not like my body when I first started sports. I didn't like my body just in general as a teenager. Being a girl and a teenager with two prosthetic legs and two hands that were misshapen that had so much reconstructive surgery on them, I thought my world was over - put a zit on top of that, and then my life is completely over.","It was honestly like 'Annie.' One day I was alone in a cold, dark Eastern European orphanage, and then the next day I was in an enchanted, mystical land known as Walmart.","I absolutely fell in love with being on the water and the peace and freedom that you get being on the water in a single boat.","I am so proud to be Ukrainian, and I'm also so proud to be an American.","When I first had my legs amputated, it was hard for me to be positive and feel pretty.

That's why I cite Facebook as an example of what could be disrupted more so than, say, Amazon - which is bit more centralized and is not exactly a network of users in the same way.","Polychain is investing in blockchain assets. We do not invest in private companies or hold shares in private companies. We invest purely in tokens or digital assets, and those include assets that people are familiar with, like bitcoin and ethereum, as well as very early-stage projects.","When decentralized blockchain protocols start displacing the centralized web services that dominate the current Internet, we'll start to see real internet-based sovereignty. The future Internet will be decentralized.","In a world with many blockchains and hundreds of tradable tokens built on top of them, entire industries are automated through software, venture capital and stock markets are circumvented, entrepreneurship is streamlined, and networks gain sovereignty through their own digital currency. This is the next phase of the Internet.","We are seeing more managed money and, to an extent, institutional money entering the space. Anecdotally speaking, I know of many people who are working at hedge funds or other investment managers who are trading cryptocurrency personally, the question is, when do people start doing it with their firms and funds?","For the first time, entrepreneurs can monetize their own open-source and peer-to-peer network. They can crowdfund and raise money from people across the world on the Internet in crypto-currency.","Polychain manages a hedge fund that invests exclusively in digital assets. We invest exclusively in protocols, not companies, and we do this by investing in things made scarce through the blockchain.","I view Bitcoin as the more democratic version of money and value transfer because no one controls it... I expect the Internet to be around longer than any nation-state, so a nation-state-backed currency is actually less safe than an Internet currency in my mind.","I think the technology will get bigger and the price of Bitcoin will go up, so I'm speculating to increase my purchasing power. But I don't intend to sell the Bitcoin. I intend to hold it until there's a day where I can just use Bitcoin completely.","Taxes have been complicated. Every single time I spend a Bitcoin, it's a taxable event. It's like I bought and sold an asset. It counts as an investment, with a short- or long-term capital gain or loss.","I've been through a lot of moments when other people thought Bitcoin was going to implode, and in those instances, I generally have seen through inaccurate coverage of it.","There will be many types of assets codified into the blockchain, and they are all not just going to be on the bitcoin blockchain - it's going to be a number of different assets here. And the best way to invest in that is a diversified portfolio.","For the first time, open source, peer-to-peer protocol developers can monetize their project on a protocol level.","We are seeing entrepreneurs issuing their own blockchain-based tokens to raise money for their networks, sidestepping the traditional, exclusive world of venture capital altogether. The importance of this cannot be overstated - in this new world, there are no companies, just protocols.","Application-specific tokens, or app-tokens, are built on top of existing general-purpose blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum. For the first time, open-source project creators can directly monetize their open-source network.","This is unproven technology, and if you don't know what you're doing, you shouldn't interact with tokens - from an investor and security perspective.","If you want to buy $10 of Ethereum and poke around with smart contracts, I encourage that. But use it as a technology, not as an investment, unless you know what you're doing.","It's like the American democratic system. When you vote, even if your candidate doesn't win, you accept that democracy was in action. When people participate in a Tezos network, they're accepting that the democratic vote of the other coin holders will govern the way the protocol moves.","If the Numerai fund performs well, that should lead to more assets under management, which should lead to more revenue for Numerai's general partner, which should lead to higher payouts for the data scientists, which implies a higher Numeraire valuation.","VCs are used to being the gatekeepers of capital.

The people who buy my art put a little more thought into it than that.","If I have the choice of traveling to Russia, India or New Zealand alone for a week for preliminary discussions or to spend that week with my family, I routinely choose my family.","I myself have already spent a third of my life in Germany, first in Cologne and then, since 1994, in Berlin.","It's hardly even noticeable that so many artists, designers and architects live here.

Many of the artists, for example, exhibit around the world, just not in Berlin.","In the past Berlin was much more radical and extreme and now it's becoming much more of a conventional European city.","Every city is always changing, on its own trajectory.","It would be wrong to say that the city of Berlin is not regulated. What I think is more interesting is to what extent a city creates a sort of safe haven for its users, so that people feel confident that the city works on their behalf.","I was in Beijing a month ago working on the smoke project in collaboration with an architect there, and I was asked very directly whether it was safe to breathe in the smoke. They did not have confidence in the museum not to use harmful smoke, and they certainly didn't have confidence that the city would protect them from harmful smoke."],"Olav Thon":["From early morning to late at night, it's such an interesting life, and I'm healthy and free, and that's not so easy with a family.","Nationalism in Norway was very strong in 1905, that we must be free of Sweden. But I must say, I'm not 100 percent sure that was a wise decision. We had the war; we were occupied by Germans from 1940 to '45. And if there had been one Scandinavian country, then it would not have been so very easy probably to go ahead with the occupation.","You can't feed a cat with cream and food in the kitchen and expect him to go catch mice.","I don't know how many companies I've bought in my life, and most of them I've bought from children whose father has passed away, and they say, 'Now we're free, would you like to buy it?'"],"Oleg Cassini":["My goal in life was to pursue the good life.","A woman who laughs is a woman conquered.","What is more important, the reality or the perception? I am perceived to be an important designer. It's enough for me.","My philosophy is this: Do not tamper with the anatomy of a woman's body; do not camouflage it.","I was brought up in Florence, a beautiful medieval town whose rhythm is completely in antiquity.","A healthy mind and body are essential. No excesses. Proper food. The body is like a Rolls-Royce. With care, it could last 200 years. It's a dynamo; the more you use it, the more you recharge it.","Be mobile at all times, even if it causes you suffering or feelings of loneliness. Unless you're willing to do that, you're never going to get the bigger rewards.","A designer is like a doctor for a woman. He has a specific job, and if he is doing it well, he will have the gratitude of the woman for the rest of his life.","The best of life is to embark on an adventure with a woman interested in having an adventure with you.","Looks, health and elegance are what counts. Someone can look wonderful in a sweatsuit.","The first lady must be a leader. She must not be a follower.","Today's designers don't care if fashion has no relationship to human anatomy.","Clothes are designed for the media, because it's a great show.","Fashion anticipates.","I am a great believer in luck.","I'm the first American designer who went all over the world.","I spent half my life being hurt. The leftovers of hurt are an automatic gesture, like a dog that salivates.","Life is such a tragicomedy.","I am neither the handsomest nor the richest nor the most powerful, but I've had the greatest women in the world.","I have programmed myself to be at least 105 years old.","A first date should be elegant. In comfortable surroundings. A place with excellent food, where you can talk easily and get to know each other.","Every time you choose a perfume, you are voting. And, of course, I hope you vote for me. Not only for my ego, but for my pocketbook. The more you buy, the more money I make.","In our society, everyone wants to be a celebrity overnight.","I've been around tennis, and I have a feeling for the sport. I still play tennis, and I can still do a lot of harm to a lot of people.","I drive my own horses in a race. And I always have.","At the very beginning of my career, when I opened my business in Italy, I was also a ranked tennis player. I had won many tournaments. To be an athlete was my first choice. Second choice: designer. However! There was more money in being a designer at that time.","Every poor designer can go with things that are popular at the moment.","You might say that I'm the Michelangelo of the dress business."],"Oleg Deripaska":["Long term I do believe internationally there is a huge misunderstanding of Russia.","I don't like Moscow. It's not my city.","I was very good in math and physics. In the Soviet time, we had a lot of Olympic-style competitions for different disciplines: I was always winning in my region.","My mum brought me to my first job when I was 12. I started electrical work at her plant. She was an engineer, a technical expert, at one of the plants in the south, and in the summer she brought me in and I learnt how industrial things work: casting, electricity, maintenance, everything.","Don't forget I'm from a military family. I was in special training in the army. I am tall, sporty and - how do you say - you can always protect yourself... I have very strong security."],"Oleg Kulik":["There is nothing in my work that can be taken as blasphemy.","I would like to reconcile the church and the circus. I wanted to transform the theatre... to get my message across that there is only one God - the living man - the person sitting next to you. That is my religion. I believe that there is a sense to life."],"Olesya Rulin":["My family is a kaleidoscope... My family is like that. We're all different colors, like a prism. When we have light shine and stuff, we're beautiful. When it's dark, nothing shines, and it's a rock.","I do go back to Russia frequently, about twice a year. I hate the flight, but it's worth it. My parents have a home in a little village of 12 houses. It's not on any map, so unless you know it's there, you won't find it. Nothing works there; no Internet, no cell phone, and the land line only works sometimes. It's great!","I love Disney. I know that some Disney stars want to break out of the Disney mold, but no, if they let me, I would work with Disney until I die.","I've had a lot of seedy side jobs. I've done it all. I've worked retail at the mall, just tons of side jobs, which I think are amazing for actors. I think everyone should have one! It helps you get more experiences, and the more experiences you have, the more you can channel into a character.","There are times as an actor when you don't work for two months, sometimes three or sometimes six, and the only thing that's going to keep you sane is if you give back and live your life. I've definitely gone through that. It's like, 'Okay, I'm out of work for two months.' That's two months I can paint.","I attempt to surf. I'm not as good as anyone else in the water. I'm more like a beached whale. I just hang out on my board. I can ride, but I get too nervous unless I go with my boyfriend or my trainer. There are too many burly men out there!","I was in a commercial for the Disney channel. I was the camp leader for the campers.","I'm a little untidy, and my favorite color is gray, and I'm always scurrying around in a panic.","I'm not musically inclined. It blows my mind that people can write music. I don't have that talent; I look up to the people that do.","I've been to London twice. I saw the Broadway show 'Billy Elliot' there - phenomenal. I was crying through the entire thing.","Me in high school, I was kind of a loner. I had a handful of friends. I'd eat my lunch in my car every day in my senior year. I went to ballet. I was a ballerina, so I was very focused on that. You kind of have to be. That was two-thirds of my week, going to ballet class.","I didn't take theater or anything. We didn't have a very good theater program. It was in western Utah - was a really small school. It wasn't developed. We didn't have the funds to do anything like that, but I did act all through high school in films because Disney Channel would shoot movies out there.","I was really blessed with parents who never said I couldn't do anything. And now I reflect as an adult on that, 'Wow, they never told me no!'","I grew up in a village of 12 houses. We had a well and a cow.","The thing I miss about Russia the most is what is called 'black bread.' It's rye bread, and everyone eats it. I slice mine up and put sunflower oil and salt on it... the best thing ever. It was like a little treat for me when I was a kid.","I had such an amazing time filming 'Major Movie Star.' I loved everyone in the cast. They all brought their own spirit to the film, and I hope that is what will be seen on screen."],"Olga Fonda":["I moved about 45 minutes from West Hollywood, and I live surrounded by nature and the wilderness, but I constantly find myself walking around, like in the commercial, saying, 'Can you hear me now?'","I didn't particularly change my name to Fonda because I knew who Fondas were. It's still going to remain a mystery. I keep it as a mystery. So, maybe one day I'll tell the story of how I changed my last name.","For the longest time, my older brother told me he was teaching me self-defense, but now that I'm grown up, I realize he was just practicing his martial arts on me.","I love watching action. I remember watching Angelina Jolie in 'Tomb Raider,' and I was like 'Wow, it's so cool when a girl can go around and kick butt.'","So many girls trying to be models, like, 'Oh my god, I want to be a model!' Nobody really knows the reality of it. It's a lot of hard work, but at the same time, it's a lot of fun.","The 'Agent X' set was never boring. During the first few days, I had to adjust to the loud noise on set, which included gun shots and explosions. After we finished filming the season, I realized I missed hearing all the noise and driving on empty freeways.","I am a little old fashioned, and I love to have my scripts printed out. There is something magical about feeling the paper, making notes and page marks.","When I arrived in the U.S., I knew little English and didn't have any friends. The neighborhood and school kids were so welcoming. They made me feel at home very quickly.","I love all sports! I'm always impressed by athletes. I also love watching the Olympic Games. In high school, I played co-ed soccer and basketball. I really enjoyed both of those sports, but I have to admit basketball wasn't my calling.","I was very shy, but when I performed, I felt like I was in my own little world. I became more confident. Dancing taught me discipline and to feel comfortable in my own skin.","I began to study martial arts because it was a great form of exercise, and I knew it would help my acting career. Martial arts reminded me of dancing. It has helped me learn fight sequences quicker.","I would love to play a superhero. I sometimes walk around thinking, 'If I were a superhero, what would my superpower be?'"],"Olga Korbut":["It's better to have a rich soul than to be rich.","And in nineteen seventy two I almost wasn't, on the team, but I knew about it just before Olympic Games for three months before this why this is was not very good for me. I'd been ready to go, you know.","This is probably why, my life is easier, and my family is very happy, because we never lie each other. This is probably all people supposed to feel each other, so be always in all of the world they'll be peace.","I am not interested in medals or titles. I don't need them. I need the love of the public and I fight for it.","And from that nineteen sixty four, this was my goal to go to Olympic Games. And I realized what does it mean, Olympic Games, like big celebration.","And, in nineteen seventy two Olympic Games I wasn't really going to be a star, and overnight I became a star.","I'd been ready too, because before Olympic Games, I wasn't compete in big competition like, World Championship, like European Championship. I just competed in national competition.","But probably this is helps to win, to win, to gold, more gold medals, and to win most my important medal, heart of people. This is most important for me.","But, I couldn't live without creation gymnastics.","But let me do I will show the world what gymnastics looks like. Well may be this is a future gymnastics.","Finally I almost dropped gymnastics because I couldn't live without create, and you know, and then, all public in the world start to say, we don't want to see gymnastics without OLGA.","I think if I wasn't in very high level, I never will be in the team. Cause I was high, in very high level.","How many people in the world is, each of them is individual. And I like to eat bread, somebody don't like that. You know this is the same in gymnastics.","Remember before nineteen seventy two Olympic Games I was total skinny, I was small, very strong, they may be don't like to see a gymnastics like that. I don't know but, gymnastics, might. Nineteen seventy two supposed to be change somewhere.","And I suggested to change very simple way to Olympic Games, in one competition, two different levels. Separate from, until sixteen, and after sixteen years old.","Because up to sixteen years old you feel gymnastics more. You can show your emotion, grace, like woman gymnastics, not kid's gymnastics. I feel I have good shape, and I can do it elements everything, but, it's not competition for me.","And we lost a lot because of that, and I think this is future gymnastics to separate ages. Because kids can do it more than adult. A woman and adult woman can show more than the small kids.","I think this is all my life. Because if I was split gymnastics and something else like far, fun or to go with friends. No, this, you're supposed to one go, one straight road and to do every day. And touch the wall, of the goal.","Anyway I will go same road because I, I was born in gymnastics. This is my, how to say, my life and my duty.","I feel great. I feel younger. And I don't feel anything at all. I don't know who knows, but right now I'm, how, how many years have I, fifty five, something like that. Forty three years old. And I feel like seventeen, like twenty five years ago.","Up to nineteen seventy six when I quit gymnastics I was very, disappointed because I didn't have anything which is, live with. I didn't have a friend so I didn't have a coach anymore.","Then I was lucky I met with my future husband, and I started new life with my husband, and I was happy again. He was a musician. I start to travel with him through Europe also and around the former Soviet Union.","Thank god, and now all I have are, twenty one years together, in January and, you know, I, you know I forgot this all about things. And anyway the first place is good thing.","I would say this is not negative this is h, a hard part in gymnastics. You can't eat, whatever you want to eat. And what kind of meal you're supposed to have, you can't."],"Olga Kurylenko":["I don't see divorce as a failure. I see it as the end to a story. In a story, everything has an end and a beginning.","A Bond girl must be a strong and independent woman, but at the same time charming and sensual. Those opposite qualities combined together make her interesting. She must be strong but at the same time feminine.","My life is not that glamorous. I actually live a pretty simple life, really. I just work. I don't have time to do all these glamorous things. I just do my thing, just work.","I love badminton. That's my sport!","Hollywood always represents this big dream and fairy tale in people's minds, but to me, it's just hard work. Of course, we play fairy tale on the red carpet. It's all Cinderella. But when the clock strikes midnight, I turn into a gray mouse and I go home, and I take my dress off and it's over. That's Hollywood.","Music evokes so many feelings in us, memories, nostalgia, things that are connected to our past.","If a man can make me laugh and stimulate me intellectually, then I wouldn't mind if he was 4 ft. 8 in. with a huge belly. The only thing that would put me off is bad breath - but even that can be fixed. A bad personality isn't so easy to fix.","I believe in miracles. At the age of 13, I was on holiday in Moscow with my mother. It was the only trip I took in my whole childhood. We stepped off a metro train and were approached by a talent scout who told me that she wanted to sign me to her modeling agency.","I love boats. I can be on a boat for days.","To be a Bond girl you need courage, charm, determination and feistiness.","I've seen guys sit the whole day doing nothing, and I hate it when people are unproductive. I don't like a guy who sits on the couch all day.","Eventually there are going to be chips in brains. Imagine if you could just buy knowledge and download it into your head instead of having to learn it. Like in 'The Matrix.' Imagine all the years saved!","I believe that when things are easy, people stay dormant.","I looked for acting classes in Paris just to do something different than modeling. And then one day I just thought, 'Okay, that's enough, I have to start doing something.' I went to the acting agency and I just told them I wanted to act and asked them if they would give me a chance, and they did.","With modelling, you provide an image that is fake; with acting you have to provide an image that's real.","I did a shoot with massive iguanas in Costa Rica when I was modeling back then. They were like little dinosaurs, and they sat right across my arms and by my face. The guy told me not to make any sudden movements because they had enormous claws. The guy said he would rip my skin if he attacked.","I was on the beach every summer. That was the pleasant part of my childhood because we were right by the sea. We'd take a picnic, and I'd spend hours in the water until I turned blue. You couldn't get me out of there.","People say, 'Where do you live?' and I say that theoretically, I live in London, but basically that's just where I go to change my suitcase. Otherwise, I'm always flying somewhere.","What I love about sci-fi is that every generation's films are based on what we know at that point in time. We make movies about the future, but it's always based on what we have. Then, as science grows and we discover new things, so do our ideas.","I've loved men that wear un-ironed clothes, it doesn't make me fall out of love. When you love someone, you should see beyond their image. It just makes me want to iron their shirt. But once you love a person, they could wear a garbage bag!","I love it when a man cooks; it's one of those points that makes me adore a guy. I think it's so romantic and I feel cared for when a man cooks.","I grew up in the Ukraine and then I went to Paris in 1996. I went there because there was a modeling agency that invited me there to work so I thought, 'Sure.'","When you live in a small town in the Ukraine, you definitely want to go to Paris.","I like men who paint or write or do something creative.","I don't like the mentality that comes with rich Russian men. Because they have money, they think they can buy a woman - and they do.","Every actor has to move in a Terrence Malick film - that's the requirement. If you stop, he'll tell you, 'No, no, keep moving.' You can't be static. It's a choreography.","On a Terrence Malick set, your thoughts are his voice. You think you're thinking, but actually he's thinking for you. He speaks to you, and he's the voice in your mind.","I just went to an acting agency one day and just said, 'I would like to act. Would you take me?' And they took me.","I just love France, I love French people, I love the French language, I love French food. I love their mentality. I just feel like it's me. I'm very French.","I always listen to all kinds of different music from different years. I listen to the contemporary, but once in a while into eighties, you know just for fun, and sometimes classical too. So I have this big mix on my i-pod... Amy Winehouse, Gwen Stefani, OutKast, Jay-Z. I listen to trance, pop, everything. It really depends on my mood.","Why marry? If you're not married, you just leave each other and it's cool. Who needs the paper? To me it means nothing.","When I earnt my first money, I went to a shop and bought jeans and a top. But then I wore them both for such a long time that finally my model agency said, 'You should buy something else!' I was saving the money because it was the first time I'd ever had any.","I bring spiritual books with me while travelling. I like books about thoughts and how you see the world.","Every one of us, no matter how damaged or abnormal or shut down, we're all looking for love. Every person needs love in this world, but our views on what love is vary enormously.","We were born and we die. In between, I think we try to live as best we can.","All I want to do is a rom-com, but you know, people see me as an action person because the first movie that was seen by a lot of the public would be 'Hitman.'","I've always had a way with a gun. As a kid, I loved to fire them at the shooting range in amusement parks. I'd always return home with a handful of prizes.","I love fire. As a child I loved setting light to things. I'd always be in the forest putting matches to pieces of wood. I've always regarded fire as my friend.","Being single is only sad if you have a problem with your own company. I'm content with mine.","I think I'll be single my whole life. It's entirely possible I'm going to end up alone. Because I don't want to make any sacrifices for my own development and achieving what I want to achieve, and I don't want a family to get in the way of that.","Having people I love around me - friends and family - is great, but I don't necessarily need a relationship.","I did not have a father. It was my mom who chose to be alone. She felt that she would be better off by herself with me after I was born.","I hate jealousy, I hate possessiveness. I'm nobody's possession.","I maybe missed money in my childhood, but I didn't miss love, that's for sure. My dad wasn't there, but I can tell you not even once did I think I was missing something.","In Paris, everybody is in black! But you know, in Ukraine everyone wears bright colours.","I'm a bit of a romantic. In theory!","With modelling, you go somewhere for 24 hours and you don't even see the city, you don't talk to people or see the culture.","If I hadn't been a model, I couldn't have become a movie actress.","I'd love to work with David Lynch. I'm such a big fan. He's a genius.","A lot of movies are made to make us dream.","When I was a kid, we never had a videogame in my house. But my cousin did, and each time I went to her house I was able to play 'Tetris' and 'Mario.' Those were the only two games I played as a child.","When you're never home and traveling, you don't play videogames.","I know how addictive videogames are - I have friends who can't get up off the couch because they're so hooked. They provide these different virtual worlds that you can live in.","As an actor, you don't want to play a one-dimensional character.","What I love about sci-fi is that every generation's films are based on what we know at that point in time. We make movies about the future but it's always based on what we have. Then as science grows and we discover new things, so do our ideas. You know?","You don't dream about things that are impossible; that are out of your range.","You know it's harder to be a girl in this world because we're the weaker sex.","To tell you the truth, I don't really follow what men wear. Men's fashion is much simpler than women's. It doesn't change as much.","When you love someone, you should see beyond their image.","I wasn't, like, this top model; I was quietly doing my work, and when I became an actress, people started doing research, and everybody found out. People dug out photos, and suddenly people became interested - but no one was interested in my photos when I was a model.","I was never a model-y model. I was doing it as a job, but people didn't even know I was a model.","Balconies scare me, and I would never do a shoot on one. I am afraid of heights.","Modeling isn't really a tough job. Acting is much harder: so much prep and changing your look and mannerisms. It's a more difficult lifestyle being a model. I traveled all the time. Although, now I wonder, because I travel all the time for acting, too. So they both have their difficulties.","We shot 'Oblivion' in Iceland; that was amazing. It's so, so beautiful. They didn't have any Waldorf Hotels there, though; we stayed in the middle of nowhere!","America's fine, nice, nice hiking near L.A. But I am European. I love London and Paris. Friends and intellect, big thought, why not?","I'll never forget the modelling shoot I did in the Bahamas on a pink sand beach at Harbour Island. It felt like I'd just landed in paradise; it was so beautiful.","I would never go travelling on my own. Some people like to go backpacking alone, but there's no way I would do that, even if you paid me - I just don't see the point. If I discover something beautiful, for me it's very important to be able to share it with someone and not just see it for myself.","I love Parisian hotels. I usually stay in either Le Bristol, which is gorgeous, or Hotel Paris Rivoli, which is very French and feels like a step back in time. I also love the luxury of Waldorf Astoria hotels.","I always try to learn a few words from a new language wherever I go.","When you grow up without it, you want to have it. It's funny, in America some people say, 'Why do you want to make money so much?' And I say, 'Well, I guess you didn't starve as a kid.'","What's interesting is to be sexy but not know it. You'll be in a restaurant, and some girls will walk in and you can tell that they really want to be sexy. It's written on their faces because that's all they want to show. There's a fear that one might not look further.","To me, I approach a small-budget, artsy, European movie the same way as a big commercial Hollywood movie. That's the most important thing. Hollywood usually represents this big dream in people's minds, but to me, it's just hard work.","My face changes when I wear make-up; I don't recognise myself.","It is true that women in Paris never put on make-up. It shocked me when I first got there - then I realised how much I liked it.","I'm very careful. I think about everything. Some people go, 'Oh, I went out and bought something and didn't realise how much it was,' but there's no such thing with me. I always think about the future because I never want to go backwards.","I never exercise, and I eat everything.","My mom Marina and I were poor and hungry. We could sometimes not afford to eat - seriously. We lived together in a small town, called Berdyansk, in Ukraine. I was an only child. I don't think we would have survived if there had been more kids."],"Olin Miller":["A man who will not lie to a woman has very little consideration for her feelings.","We probably wouldn't worry about what people think of us if we could know how seldom they do.","You probably wouldn't worry about what people think of you if you could know how seldom they do.","If you realize you aren't so wise today as you thought you were yesterday, you're wiser today.","If you want to make an easy job seem mighty hard, just keep putting off doing it.","It's far easier to forgive an enemy after you've got even with him.","If you think there are no new frontiers, watch a boy ring the front doorbell on his first date.","Writing is the hardest way of earning a living, with the possible exception of wrestling alligators.","Inheritance taxes are so high that the happiest mourner at a rich man's funeral is usually Uncle Sam.","What a pity human beings can't exchange problems. Everyone knows exactly how to solve the other fellow's.","One of the best things people could do for their descendents would be to sharply limit the number of them."],"Olive Schreiner":["Everything has two sides - the outside that is ridiculous, and the inside that is solemn.","Perhaps the old monks were right when they tried to root love out; perhaps the poets are right when they try to water it. It is a blood-red flower, with the color of sin; but there is always the scent of a god about it.","There was never a great man who had not a great mother.","Men are like the earth and we are the moon; we turn always one side to them, and they think there is no other, because they don't see it - but there is.","We were equals once when we lay new-born babes on our nurse's knees. We will be equal again when they tie up our jaws for the last sleep.","No good work is ever done while the heart is hot and anxious and fretted.","Our fathers had their dreams; we have ours; the generation that follows will have its own. Without dreams and phantoms man cannot exist.","It is finer to bring one noble human being into the world and rear it well... than to kill ten thousand.","Power! Did you ever hear of men being asked whether other souls should have power or not? It is born in them.","How hard it is to make your thoughts look anything but imbecile fools when you paint them with ink on paper."],"Oliver Cromwell":["Subtlety may deceive you; integrity never will.","He who stops being better stops being good.","Do not trust the cheering, for those persons would shout as much if you or I were going to be hanged.","God made them as stubble to our swords.","Nature can do more than physicians.","Not only strike while the iron is hot, but make it hot by striking.","Keep your faith in God, but keep your powder dry.","Who can love to walk in the dark? But providence doth often so dispose.","A few honest men are better than numbers.","Put your trust in God; but be sure to keep your powder dry.","What is all our histories, but God showing himself, shaking and trampling on everything that he has not planted.","No one rises so high as he who knows not whither he is going.","I would have been glad to have lived under my wood side, and to have kept a flock of sheep, rather than to have undertaken this government.","We are Englishmen; that is one good fact.","I had rather have a plain, russet-coated Captain, that knows what he fights for, and loves what he knows, than that which you call a Gentle-man and is nothing else.","Necessity has no law.","I beseech you, in the bowels of Christ, think it possible you may be mistaken.","The State, in choosing men to serve it, takes no notice of their opinions. If they be willing faithfully to serve it, that satisfies."],"Oliver E. Williamson":["The hypothesis that economic organization is the resultant of a series of historic accidents is intructive in that many organizational innovations appear to be the result of trial and error.","The organization of the government itself is something which we ought to examine in a more self-conscious way - the Federal Reserve and the Treasury and the Securities and Exchange Commission. The mission that each of them has is mainly economic but should be informed by good organizational practices.","The field of 'economics and organization' is still young and needs support. I have been a chaired professor much of my academic life and know that such chairs are important for recruiting and retaining faculty.","If you believe that markets operate in Alan Greenspan fashion, then you don't inquire into the details.","My university teacher and mentor Kenneth Arrow remembers me as a student who asked good questions. Although I had not previously thought of myself in that way, on reflection I think that Arrow was right.","My initial thoughts of becoming a lawyer changed in high school as I became more attracted to math and science and began talking about being an engineer.","My first jobs after graduation in 1955 were as a project engineer for G.E. and later with the U.S. government in Washington, D.C., where I met and married my wife, Dolores Celini.","Teaching can be learning, especially if student curiosity with the question 'What's going on here?' can be elicited.","Ronald Coase, in his classic 1937 paper on 'The Nature of the Firm,' was the first to bring the concept of transaction costs to bear on the study of firm and market organization.","The remediableness criterion is an effort to deal symmetrically with real world institutions, both public and private, warts and all. The criterion is this: an extant mode of organization for which no superior feasible form of organization can be described and implemented with expected net gains is presumed to be efficient.","The presumption that an extant mode is efficient if the expected net gain is negative can nevertheless be rebutted by showing that the obstacles to implementing an otherwise superior feasible alternative are 'unfair.'","Managerial discretion can take many forms, some very subtle. Individual managers may run slack operations; they may pursue subgoals that are at variance with corporate purposes; they can engage in self-dealing.","The transaction cost approach maintains that some projects are easy to finance by debt and ought to be financed by debt. These are projects for which physical-asset specificity is low to moderate.","Vertical intergration is an organizational response to the contracting difficulties that attend intermediate product markets where trades that are supported by transaction-specific assets are exposed to hazard.","The lens of contract focuses predominantly on gains from trade whereas orthodoxy is focused on resource allocation."],"Oliver Ellsworth":["The charge of being ambiguous and indefinite may be brought against every human composition, and necessarily arises from the imperfection of language. Perhaps no two men will express the same sentiment in the same manner and by the same words; neither do they connect precisely the same ideas with the same words.","A desire of gain is common to mankind, and the general motive to business and industry.","A people cannot long retain their freedom, whose government is incapable of protecting them.","It may be assumed as a fixed truth that the prosperity and riches of the farmer must depend on the prosperity and good national regulation of trade.","Liberty is a word which, according as it is used, comprehends the most good and the most evil of any in the world.","A government capable of controlling the whole, and bringing its force to a point, is one of the prerequisites for national liberty. We combine in society, with an expectation to have our persons and properties defended against unreasonable exactions either at home or abroad.","The right of the judge to inflict punishment gives him both power and opportunity to oppress the innocent; yet none but crazy men will from thence determine that it is best to have neither a legislature nor judges.","Some persons never attain to the happy art of perspicuous expression, and it is equally true that some persons, thro' a mental defect of their own, will judge the most correct and certain language of others to be indefinite and ambiguous.","Judge candidly what a wretched figure the American empire will exhibit in the eye of other nations, without a power to array and support a military force for its own protection.","The power of collecting money from the people is not to be rejected because it has sometimes been oppressive. Public credit is as necessary for the prosperity of a nation as private credit is for the support and wealth of a family."],"Oliver Evans":["It frequently happens that two persons, reasoning right on a mechanical subject, think alike and invent the same thing without any communication with each other.","People did not even then like to eat dirt, if they could see it."],"Oliver Goldsmith":["Life is a journey that must be traveled no matter how bad the roads and accommodations.","I love everything that's old, - old friends, old times, old manners, old books, old wine.","If you were to make little fishes talk, they would talk like whales.","People seldom improve when they have no other model but themselves to copy.","Tenderness is a virtue.","With disadvantages enough to bring him to humility, a Scotsman is one of the proudest things alive.","Pity and friendship are two passions incompatible with each other.","Success consists of getting up just one more time than you fall.","You can preach a better sermon with your life than with your lips.","Where wealth accumulates, men decay.","A great source of calamity lies in regret and anticipation; therefore a person is wise who thinks of the present alone, regardless of the past or future.","Law grinds the poor, and rich men rule the law.","Let schoolmasters puzzle their brain, With grammar, and nonsense, and learning, Good liquor, I stoutly maintain, Gives genius a better discerning.","Ceremonies are different in every country, but true politeness is everywhere the same.","A man who leaves home to mend himself and others is a philosopher; but he who goes from country to country, guided by the blind impulse of curiosity, is a vagabond.","I chose my wife, as she did her wedding gown, for qualities that would wear well.","Every absurdity has a champion to defend it.","The best way to make your audience laugh is to start laughing yourself.","The company of fools may first make us smile, but in the end we always feel melancholy.","When lovely woman stoops to folly, and finds too late that men betray, what charm can soothe her melancholy, what art can wash her guilt away?","The hours we pass with happy prospects in view are more pleasing than those crowded with fruition.","Hope is such a bait, it covers any hook.","Be not affronted at a joke. If one throw salt at thee, thou wilt receive no harm, unless thou art raw.","Surely the best way to meet the enemy is head on in the field and not wait till they plunder our very homes.","Modesty seldom resides in a breast that is not enriched with nobler virtues.","Friendship is a disinterested commerce between equals; love, an abject intercourse between tyrants and slaves.","Man wants but little here below, nor wants that little long.","They say women and music should never be dated.","Write how you want, the critic shall show the world you could have written better.","On the stage he was natural, simple, affecting, 'Twas only when he was off, he was acting.","All that a husband or wife really wants is to be pitied a little, praised a little, and appreciated a little.","Conscience is a coward, and those faults it has not strength enough to prevent it seldom has justice enough to accuse.","There are some faults so nearly allied to excellence that we can scarce weed out the vice without eradicating the virtue.","I was ever of the opinion, that the honest man who married and brought up a large family, did more service than he who continued single, and only talked of population.","Could a man live by it, it were not unpleasant employment to be a poet.","Girls like to be played with, and rumpled a little too, sometimes.","Honour sinks where commerce long prevails.","The jests of the rich are ever successful.","Romance and novel paint beauty in colors more charming than nature, and describe a happiness that humans never taste. How deceptive and destructive are those pictures of consummate bliss!","As writers become more numerous, it is natural for readers to become more indolent; whence must necessarily arise a desire of attaining knowledge with the greatest possible ease."],"Oliver Hardy":["That's another fine mess you've gotten me into.","We never see ourselves as others see us."],"Oliver Herford":["A woman's mind is cleaner than a man's: She changes it more often.","A rolling stone gathers no moss, but it gains a certain polish.","A man is known by the silence he keeps.","Many are called but few get up.","Modesty: the gentle art of enhancing your charm by pretending not to be aware of it.","Cat: a pygmy lion who loves mice, hates dogs, and patronizes human beings.","Darling: the popular form of address used in speaking to a member of the opposite sex whose name you cannot at the moment remember.","Tact: to lie about others as you would have them lie about you.","The Irish gave the bagpipes to the Scotts as a joke, but the Scotts haven't seen the joke yet.","Age, like distance lends a double charm.","Manuscript: something submitted in haste and returned at leisure.","A man must love a thing very much if he not only practices it without any hope of fame and money, but even... without any hope of doing it well.","There is always room at the top - after the investigation.","Only the young die good.","What is my loftiest ambition? I've always wanted to throw an egg at an electric fan.","When I go abroad I always sail from Boston because it is such a pleasant place to get away from."],"Oliver Hudson":["You can love someone like your son, even if he's not your biological son, and you can love someone like your father, even if he's not your biological father.","Father or stepfather - those are just titles to me. They don't mean anything.","I want babies. I think I'll be a great dad.","Blood relatives often have nothing to do with family, and similarly, family is about who you choose to make your life with.","His advice to me is basically to just love what you do and don't let the fear of failure stop you.","We were taught manners and we had to do our chores - Katie and I grew up as normal kids.","I have a box of things from Becca, my high school girlfriend, and Vanessa; and each one of them was love. I have the notes, the valentines, 20 mixed tapes, all of it. It's important to keep that stuff.","Fathers in today's modern families can be so many things.","Personally, fame never really played any part in our family life.","My mom is in her mid-60s and has more energy and is more youthful than any human being I know. It's pretty incredible.","Parent hard, play hard. That's my philosophy."],"Oliver Jackson-Cohen":["Acting gives me an adrenalin rush I don't get from anything else.","For a long time, I so badly wanted to work with Jeremy Piven, and I ended up on 'Mr. Selfridge' with him. He was such a character - so brilliant to work with.","It's never fun having to bulk up for a job on an action film, then lose weight for another role. I don't actually mind working out, but it's the diet: I'm half-French, so I love my food, and boiled chicken breast for breakfast is not my idea of a good meal.","I remember being told very early on, 'Just say what they want to hear in the audition, and we'll figure it out later on.' So there have been a few tricky moments. I once said I could ride, when the truth is I'm terrified of horses, but I got the job!","When I started acting, everyone told me to get a backup in case it didn't work out; if there was something else I could have done, I would have done it. Acting should never be your chosen path if you can help it.","I love Dior and Commes des Garcons, but I can't really afford them.","There's so much fakeness in the fashion world, but Mum and Dad have always given us a good work ethic and were quite worried at first about whether I could make a living from acting. They've been together for 29 years and share the same values. I really do want to have that kind of marriage myself.","I went to the premier of 'Stardust,' which starred Michelle Pfeiffer. I nearly died when I saw her on the red carpet - she's so beautiful.","I had this maroon 'Lion King' tracksuit that my mum couldn't take off me. I wore it until the sleeves ended at my elbows and the trousers ended at my knees."],"Oliver Joseph Lodge":["Any person without invincible prejudice who had the same experience would come to the same broad conclusion, viz., that things hitherto held impossible do actually occur.","The old series of sittings with Mrs. Piper convinced me of survival for reasons which I should find it hard to formulate in any strict fashion, but that was their distinct effect.","The hypothesis of surviving intelligence and personality - not only surviving but anxious and able with difficulty to communicate - is the simplest and most straightforward and the only one that fits all the facts.","Basing my conclusions on experience I am absolutely convinced not only of survival but of demonstrated survival, demonstrated by occasional interaction with matter in such a way as to produce physical results.","Of mediumship there are many grades, one of the simplest forms being the capacity to receive an impression or automatic writing, under peaceful conditions, in an ordinary state; but the whole subject is too large to be treated here.","The amount of sophistication varies according to the quality of the medium, and to the state of the same medium at different times; it must be attributed in the best cases physiologically to the medium, intellectually to the control.","We know that communication must be hampered, and its form largely determined, by the unconscious but inevitable influence of a transmitting mechanism, whether that be of a merely mechanical or of a physiological character.","In other cases, when the medium becomes entranced, the demonstration of a communicator's separate intelligence may become stronger and the sophistication less.","Life must be considered sui generis; it is not a form of energy, nor can it be expressed in terms of something else.","But although life is not energy, any more than it is matter, yet it directs energy and thereby controls arrangements of matter.","The properties which differentiate living matter from any kind of inorganic imitation may be instinctively felt, but can hardly be formulated without expert knowledge.","Whatever life may really be, it is to us an abstraction: for the word is a generalised term to signify that which is common to all animals and plants, and which is not directly operative in the inorganic world.","Death is not extinction. Neither the soul nor the body is extinguished or put out of existence.","They definitely mean to maintain that the process called death is a mere severence of soul and body, and that the soul is freed rather than injured thereby.","Death is not a word to fear, any more than birth is."],"Oliver Kahn":["If we perform as a unit and if every single player gives it his very best, everything can happen.","There is no reason to change this system. I don't think we'll abandon it. For us the most important thing is to be compact in the back. That's the kind of game we have to play here and it will be very difficult to beat us.","Complaining and arguing will not help. We are fully concentrating on the game against the Czechs.","This match is about sport and I separate that completely from politics.","If I play, I try to concentrate on producing my best.","When you look at our programme for the next few weeks, you do not fancy a trip to the Oktoberfest.","We are Bayern Munich and English teams always have trouble as soon as they leave the island.","I have a feeling we are going to be world champions, I can't really explain why. Brazil are probably the best team in the world in terms of individual players. But the team with the most gifted players do not always win.","A Germany team should not be afraid going into a tournament. History shows that we can raise the level of our game when it matters."],"Oliver North":["We've been in the nation-building business since World War I, and especially since WWII. The goal is not a Jeffersonian Democracy in Afghanistan, but a representative government that respects human rights, protects its own people, and is a friend of the West. These are very realistic - and necessary - goals.","We've got a very difficult situation created by this embrace of the so-called Arab Spring. And that's not getting better. It's getting worse. The carnage for the people of Syria is horrific, and it's quite frankly too little, too late to reverse a lot of that.","I was provided with additional input that was radically different from the truth. I assisted in furthering that version.","I thought using the Ayatollah's money to support the Nicaraguan resistance was a neat idea.","There's the assumption being made by the national security advisers to the Obama administration that the North Korean leadership is not suicidal, that they know they will be obliterated if they attacked the United States. But I would point that everything in South Korea and Japan is well within range of what they might want to do.","I want to make it clear that I honestly answered every question put to me during the so-called Iran-Contra hearings. But if they didn't ask me about something, I wasn't about to reveal things that would put other people in jeopardy.","The lesson of Pearl Harbor ought never to be forgotten, and of course the motto that came from that, 69 years ago, the war which my dad fought, was 'Remember Pearl Harbor, never again.' We need to keep that to mind.","If you could have imagined that someone is happy that Obama is president, it has to be Jimmy Carter because he is no longer the worst president in our history.","The Obama administration has turned a blind eye to radical Islam since before they came to office. If you look at everything that's transpired since the famous Cairo speech in 2009, it's all been an embrace of those who are the most radical elements in that part of the world. That is not a good sign for America's foreign policy.","I came here to tell you the truth, the good, the bad and the ugly.","I'm trusting in the Lord and a good lawyer.","In North Korea, grass is a vegetable eaten by the people, and they've got nuclear weapons and intercontinental ballistic missiles. So, something more stringent than what's been done to North Korea is going to have to work; otherwise, a military strike is the only option.","Bill Clinton is not my commander-in-chief.","A Commander-in-Chief needs to do two things. One - tell us who the enemy is. And two - say we are fighting to win.","I was authorized to do everything that I did.","I like to tell people that I have the best job in the media. All I do is hang around with heroes. I do that every week for my 'War Stories' documentary series - and when FOX News wants - I go off and cover the young Americans we send to places like Afghanistan or Iraq.","I am here to accept responsibility for that which I did. I will not accept responsibility for that which I did not do.","I haven't, in the 23 years that I have been in the uniformed services of the United States of America, ever violated an order - not one.","And so, the youngsters you have today, even though there are far fewer of them - in World War II 16.5 million men and women in uniform, today roughly a million in uniform in spite of the fact that the country is almost twice as large a population as we had in World War II.","I would not trade you a billion dollars for the kids I led to combat in Vietnam or in fact any of the Marines that I served with for a quarter of a century.","Without any intended hubris, I've lead a pretty exciting life. What I've tried to do in Mission Compromised is draw on those experiences to create a sense of excitement and realism within the story.","As a Marine officer in combat, I was responsible for the lives and safety of all the Marines who served with me.","Vladimir Putin is leading a dying country. Vladimir Putin's regime exports three things: petroleum products - coal, natural gas, and hydrocarbon energy in the form of petroleum. Number two, it exports arms, and, number three, it exports people.","It's one thing to say don't commit atrocities on the battlefield. It's another thing to say don't get caught doing atrocities.","In uniform, I had to make judgments about the best course of action in combat when the only choices were 'bad' or 'worse.' As a member of the media, I only had to decide how to get the best 'shot' - preferably without getting shot.","I don't think there is another person in America that wants to tell this story as much as I do.","And of course there is so much of World War II that is documented that we never have seen.","I never considered myself a fall guy. I know what I did. I know why I did it. I'm not ashamed of it.","I think as a rifle platoon and company commander your view is about 1,000 meters in front of you and you hope you can cover that ground and not have to back up and give it up again.","I'm still in touch with a lot people who continue to serve our country well.","In my first book, Under Fire, I wrote that I revered Ronald Reagan. That was a dozen years ago. I still feel that way. I think he changed the world for the better for my children and my children's children.","In World War II, the book you have in front of you, it was said and it is probably true, that there was not a single American who did not know the name of somebody serving in uniform.","The terrorists that we are up against today do not rely upon cell phones and SAT phones and emails. They rely on couriers. You cannot intercept what a courier is telling somebody.","Today, only 2 percent of the people know the name of someone serving in uniform. That means 2 percent of your listeners can actually conjure up the image of someone wearing the uniform of the military of the United States.","God knows, we don't want prayer.","One of the great upsides to a national book tour is the chance to break out of television's cocoon and interact directly with the American people.","Writers are storytellers. So are readers.","The National Security Council's real role is to coordinate the various activities of the government of the United States in the furtherance of American foreign policy.","When you're told to go brief a United States senator on a covert operation, you go do it. And you trust the information isn't going to leak.","I can remember as a young lieutenant being sent into the DMZ in the divided Vietnam, from North Vietnam.","The American people need to tell their member of Congress that we need a strong defense to protect us and to prevent wars. We can't get away with simply leading from behind and gutting our defenses.","My mom told me a long time ago, 'Never get in a fight with a lady.'","Nothing is going to change the fact that I believe Ronald Reagan is the greatest president in my lifetime - may well be the greatest president this nation ever had.","The United Nations passed so-called sanctions again on North Korea, and they've said they 'will exercise their preemptive right to a nuclear attack.' I don't think this ought to be taken kindly.","I'm a military guy. I'm not a political character.","My wife said to me... you never understood what we were going through back home, did you? And I didn't. And I have to confess that.","What's been happening in Iraq, what young Americans wearing flak jackets, helmets and flight suits have done is... created the circumstances under which Iraq can become our closest ally in that part of the world and still have a representative government. And that's going to be a very good thing considering what's going on in that neighborhood.","All of my high school male teachers were WWII and/or Korean War veterans. They taught my brothers and me the value of service to our country and reinforced what our dad had shown us about the meaning of service."],"Oliver Platt":["Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.","I love the script and I just thought it was a great role. Like I say, it's like this - the script is like this sad, funny, desperate love song to the lost American man.","You know, grieve your wife, this is an impulsive thing and you have no idea the kind of trouble you're getting yourself into it. And of course he doesn't listen to me and he adopts this child.","You know that was much more of a kind of cameo, I love the movie, I love the story, I love Johnny as a fun little role but it was more of a cameo, not anywhere near as developed as this role.","You know I feel very fortunate that my life has turned out the way that it has - whatever that means - I mean... you know, to say that I would be glad would mean that I planned it.","The only thing I wanted to do when I was a young naive kid was to become a New York stage actor.","I think of myself as an actor.","2005 was a great year for me for fantastic roles that nobody saw.","The directors that I end up having a really good time with are the ones that understand the fluidity of the medium and are interested in catching lightning in a bottle.","People start to act very unusually when they find out that they're dying, that they don't have that many years left."],"Oliver Reed":["I'm not a villain, I've never hurt anyone. I'm just a tawdry character who explodes now and again.","I have two ambitions in life: one is to drink every pub dry, the other is to sleep with every woman on earth.","I do think a carpenter needs a good hammer to bang in the nail.","I like to give my inhibitions a bath now and then.","What's the point of staying sober?","Awe and respect are two different things.","But the trouble is that when you drink it, you invariably meet other people drinking it.","Raquel Welch is someone I can also live without. We've got some love scenes together and I am dreading them!","Even though people say Richard Harris and I have been having a great feud, it's not true.","I believe my woman shouldn't work outside the home.","I also use women as a sex object; maybe I'm kinky. However, I like to talk to them as well.","I like the effect drink has on me.","I'm really a pacifist.","I do not live in the world of sobriety.","I don't like doing most things unless I can do them quite well.","If the money's right, I'll do a film.","I'm not as thrilled with myself as I used to be.","I have made many serious statements - I just can't remember any of them. I guess they mustn't have been very important.","I wouldn't like to see a chick of mine taking her clothes off and kissing a fellow on screen. And my girls must get very hurt when they see me doing it.","When I come home and I'm tired from filming all day, I expect her to be there and make sure everything is cool for me. You know, like drawing my bath and helping me into bed.","I might get drunk one day and fall in love or fall over a hooker outside, and I would have consummated a relationship that I couldn't necessarily believe in.","I'm only drinking white wine because I'm on a diet and I don't eat.","Then you get into it, especially if you start talking about football, fighting and Muhammad Ali. Then the ladies get very bored and start delivering ultimatums.","You get so weak from eating pears that you fall down, and then they come and take you away on a stretcher.","At the New York Athletic Club they serve amazing food. People go there, get healthy, and then eat themselves to death - which is, I suppose, the right way to do it."],"Oliver Sacks":["I feel I should be trying to complete my life, whatever 'completing a life' means.","If a man has lost a leg or an eye, he knows he has lost a leg or an eye; but if he has lost a self - himself - he cannot know it, because he is no longer there to know it.","I was always the youngest boy in my class at high school. I have retained this feeling of being the youngest, even though now I am almost the oldest person I know.","Elements and birthdays have been intertwined for me since boyhood, when I learned about atomic numbers.","I often feel that life is about to begin, only to realize it is almost over.","With any hallucinations, if you can do functional brain imagery while they're going on, you will find that the parts of the brain usually involved in seeing or hearing - in perception - have become super active by themselves. And this is an autonomous activity; this does not happen with imagination.","I think hallucinations need to be discussed. There are all sorts of hallucinations, and then many sorts which are okay, like the ones I think which most of us have in bed at night before we fall asleep, when we can see all sorts of patterns or faces and scenes.","In general, people are afraid to acknowledge hallucinations because they immediately see them as a sign of something awful happening to the brain, whereas in most cases they're not."],"Oliver Sim":["I believe with a lot of support shows, people are very much there to see the headliner. You don't necessarily have their full attention, and some of what we do requires a lot of silence.","In our school, there were lots of bands putting up posters saying 'Come to our gigs'.","I enjoy not knowing everything about a musician I like. At a time when you can find out a popstar's favourite animal, I think it's more exciting not to know. I just don't want to tell everyone everything.","The darkness of clubs makes me feel much more secure, and you can hide behind smoke and lights.","The day that you walk out in front of 30,000 people and don't get nervous is probably the day to give it up. It's inspiring to be a little terrified.","I don't find touring very creative. There's not much time to yourself with your instruments.","To perform in front of a room full of people you go to school with would be terrifying. I couldn't do it now.","I can't even imagine how it must be to be a solo artist playing with session musicians.","The xx do not condone guns!","I've never felt any huge intrusions into my personal life.","In the studio, there's no tiptoeing. As opposed to big, blow-out arguments, there are just lots of little solutions.","I was just making music in my bedroom. I never wanted to be onstage.","Normally, I don't like explaining songs. I don't want to kill anyone's interpretation or the story they want to make for themselves.","Romy and I, we're learning how to share the xx with people who aren't in the xx.","When you write songs for your best friends and maybe two other people to hear, and then realize that a million other people are going to hear them, it can be a bit worrying. You get concerned about what you might reveal.","Not to flatter myself, but I know that you can influence people's opinion as a musician, and I don't want to.","My writing has changed a lot. From 16 to 19, I've changed a lot. My kind of writing in the beginning was very observational; now it's grown very personal for me. I use it as a diary in many ways.","My own personal goal is I just hope to still write songs and kind of let that sustain me as a job. If I could never have a 9-to-5 job, and making a living doing this, it'd just be incredible.","I feel more confident and like I have more to say. I feel like I'm working more than ever, not just from fantasy, but actual experience. I'm an adult now - I actually have experience.","'Coexist' was tough to make.","Beyonce is very special. I think the super-pop thing that supposedly died with Michael Jackson is still there with her.","I was living with my dad, and I loved it. But I could totally imagine that if I didn't move out quickly, I would end up staying there well into my 30s.","When I finished school, I didn't continue to go to university, because I decided I wanted to do music.","Music is something I can't stop. Whether people are going to hear it or not, I'm still going to make music.","As cliched as it sounds, I'm taking every day as it comes.","I can see myself always writing songs - but I'm not sure if I'll always want to perform.","I remember reading an interview with Adele, where she said that touring was the loneliest thing in the world. All of her band are hired, so, really, it's just her. I can't imagine what that must be like.","You see bands putting ads in the paper: 'drummer wanted'. I could never be in a set-up like that.","I don't think it's good for people to know too much about you. With my favourite bands, I don't want to have the inside track on every single aspect of their personal lives.","It's a lot easier to play in front of quite a lot of strangers than a couple of your friends just because when it's someone that really knows you, it's much more scary.","I don't know what I was expecting or what I was dreaming about the xx accomplishing."],"Oliver St. John":["If a queen bee were crossed with a Friesian bull, would not the land flow with milk and honey?","Politics is the chloroform of the Irish people, or rather the hashish."],"Oliver Stone":["Never underestimate the power of jealousy and the power of envy to destroy. Never underestimate that.","But in answer to your question about the conspiracy angle, I think that any historian worth his salt, and this is where I fault Stephen Ambrose and a lot of these guys who attack me - not all of life is a result of conspiracy by any means! Accident occurs alongside conspiracy.","I'm terrible at horror movies, by the way. I get scared so easily.","Anybody who's been through a divorce will tell you that at one point. they've thought murder. The line between thinking murder and doing murder isn't that major.","I've been to war, and it's not easy to kill. It's bloody and messy and totally horrifying, and the consequences are serious.","I do believe that movies are subject to a million interpretations.","I do believe there are leaders who are like lightning and they come along and they lead. The Lincolns of the world, the Alexander the Greats, they do exist. They have existed.","A woman can be very beautiful and an ideal model and she will photograph incredibly well, but she'll appear in film and it won't work. What works is some fusion of physical beauty with some mental field or whatever you call it. I don't know.","Fear may very well be a caveman fear of the predator, of the giant lizard chasing them - maybe that's what Steven Spielberg connects with so well in Lost World.","I am not trying to be a historian and a dramatist; I'm a dramatist, a dramatic historian, or one who does a dramatic interpretation of history.","I have the right to interpretation as a dramatist. I research. It's my responsibility to find the research. It's my responsibility to digest it and do the best that I can with it. But at a certain point that responsibility will become an interpretation.","I study history in order to give an interpretation.","If anything, if you can get somebody interested in something and get them excited, that's great. You should be praised for having opened the debate and having asked the right questions.","In any film there's always a historical implication.","There's an electrical thing about movies.","I will come out with my interpretation. If I'm wrong, fine. It will become part of the debris of history, part of the give and take.","But I suppose film is distinctive because of its nature, of its being able to cut through time with editing.","I think that many people in history who had power were bumped off because they had power.","I'd like to do a story about the medieval ages where in every scene you'd sort of feel that you were in the 12th century. That would be great to get that feeling.","I'd love to do historical pictures more, but I don't know if I can.","I've met people who will go to a movie that I can't stand and they say that they saw that movie ten times. There's something they like and identified in that movie, and I don't see it.","It's interesting that when economic times were the hardest, that's when many people embraced liberalism.","One of my fantasies in my life has been that I was granted access with a camera to go back in time, and to film the actual campaign of Alexander crossing into India through Iran and Persia.","Well first of all you have to make the character strong so that people can follow that. And then hopefully that character can integrate with the background of the social situation that people can recognize.","When I was a child, I'd see a movie, I took it for what it was, I enjoyed it. And if I believed it I would tend to be more interested in knowing more about it.","You're not a historian, but most historians will tell you that they make very discrete judgment as to what facts to omit in order to make their book into some shape, some length that can be managed.","When you look at a movie, you look at a director's thought process.","One of the joys of going to the movies was that it was trashy, and we should never lose that.","Lunch is for wimps.","I think experience will teach you a combination of liberalism and conservatism. We have to be progressive and at the same time we have to retain values. We have to hold onto the past as we explore the future.","I never put out a history, I put out a dramatic history.","I would vote for the man who's lived life, who's done different occupations, who's been out in the real world and struggled to make a living, struggled to raise a family, struggled with life as it exists. So I'd vote for experience, honest experience.","You do the best job you can. You take it step by step. It's hard enough to make a movie. If it works, that's great. If it means something beyond the moment to somebody, they can take it and it lasts through the years, we'll see."],"Oliver Tambo":["The land on which the cattle grazed was communal property. It was owned by no one. It was nobody's private farm. It was the common property of the people, shared by the people. So the practice of sharing was central to the concept of ownership of property.","The true facts are not always obvious. They often have to be looked for.","We have got to move away from the concept of race and color because that is what apartheid is. We cannot end apartheid if we retain these concepts.","We all belong to South Africa, and South Africa belongs to us all.","Our target is not negotiations, it is the end of the apartheid system. There can be no compromise about that.","Apartheid is inherently a practice of violence.","We had to forge an alliance of strength based not on colour but on commitment to the total abolition of apartheid and oppression; we would seek allies, of whatever colour, as long as they were totally agreed on our liberation aims.","The sanctions will not kill us. It's apartheid that's killing us.","How can it be said we should use only constitutional means in our struggle, when all resistance is illegal and we have no way to change the brutal realities of the racism regime?","The fight for freedom must go on until it is won; until our country is free and happy and peaceful as part of the community of man, we cannot rest.","I can see quite clearly that if there was a single event that launched me on the road to ultimate involvement at the heart of South African politics, it was an assault on an African woman by her white employer in a kitchen in Fort Hare.","We have a vision of South Africa in which black and white shall live and work together as equals in conditions of peace and prosperity.","There is no way a spirit of resistance that has sunk so deep in the population can be repressed.","We believe that the world, too, can destroy apartheid, firstly by striking at the economy of South Africa.","The results showed that Joe Mokoena and I had made history. For the first time in the history of education in South Africa, two African students had passed the JC with a First Class degree, regarded as a rare achievement for any student.","I would not hesitate to vote for a white person as president if I thought he was the best person for the job.","Racial discrimination, South Africa's economic power, its oppression and exploitation of all the black peoples, are part and parcel of the same thing.","To go back means defeat.","It was always my desire to strike new ground and help to lend weight where it was most required.","The violence associated with the A.N.C. is minimal, infinitesimal next to the violence of the apartheid regime.","My problem in calling for pressures on South Africa is to convince the youth to convince their governments and people that it is not the South African goods that are cheap, but the forced labor of the Africans.","How do you deal with a criminal that will not listen to what you have to say and who continues his policy of violence? Some say you continue to talk and let him tire himself out. But nearly 40 years after the institution of apartheid, is there anyone who still believes that verbal persuasion will work?","The A.N.C. was established in 1912 and the S.A. Communist Party in 1921, and so there has been an overlapping of membership all along the line.","Whoever says that sanctions will only deteriorate the situations of blacks in South Africa does not know the criminal, murderous character of genocide that represents the system of apartheid.","For decades, we resisted violence - until Sharpeville.","It is often suggested that the A.N.C. is controlled by the Communist Party, by Communists. Well, I have been long enough in the A.N.C. to know that that has never been true.","The Soviet Union was a very useful ally in the defeat of Nazi Germany.","Responsibility for the proper conduct of children was not confined to their parents only. When they misbehaved, they misbehaved against the community. And a senior member of the community was expected to do something about it.","You were not wanted. You were, at best, tolerated. You had to be constantly on your guard, like an animal in a jungle full of beasts of prey. You experienced it all within the short distance of five miles from the gates of St. Peter's to Park Station in the city.","The popularity of leaders like Mandela was an invitation to counter-attack by the government. Mandela was banned from speaking, from attending gatherings, from leaving Johannesburg, from belonging to any organization.","I am convinced that the world-wide protests during the Rivonia trial saved Mandela and his fellow-accused from a death sentence. But in South Africa, a life sentence means imprisonment until death - or until the defeat of the government which holds these men prisoner.","I was just an ordinary student. I'd always gotten along with authorities quite well.","The more pressure you bring from without, the less internal pressure is necessary.","Using the power you derive from the discovery of the truth about racism in South Africa, you will help us to remake our part of the world into a corner of the globe on which all - of which all of humanity can be proud.","We seek to create a united Democratic and non-racial society.","It may be that apartheid brings such stupendous economic advantages to countries that they would sooner have apartheid than permit its destruction.","We were very lucky. My mother and stepmothers were on very, very good terms, and so we, the children, grew up as brothers and sisters.","In Holy Cross, I came to like school, to like studying in a way I had never done before.","My sister had some ailment and convulsions that she suffered from, and she had been sent to some place to go and get healed there. She was brought back and prayed for by those people. She recovered; in fact, she grew to be an evangelist in her own right, healing people and traveling around.","It was becoming clear that, from being at the top at Holy Cross, we were at the bottom at St. Peter's. Objectively, this was very good, for it offered us a challenge and an opportunity to grow if we were ready to take it; and we surely were.","It was of limited usefulness to head great rallies. The government did not listen, and, soon enough, the tear gas and the muzzles of the guns were turned against the people. The justice of our cries went unrecognized.","Mandela drafted the M Plan, a simple, commonsense plan for organization on a street basis so that Congress volunteers would be in daily touch with the people, alert to their needs and able to mobilize them.","In May 1961, South Africa was to be declared a Nationalist Republic. There was a white referendum, but no African was consulted.","This uprising of 1976-77 was, of course, the historic watershed... Within a short period of time, it propelled into the forefront of our struggle millions of young people.","The U.S. is the last country that should see itself as an ally of the apartheid system.","The A.N.C. is a national movement. We all - Communists and non-Communists alike - want a nonracial, democratic, united South Africa.","The struggle to conquer oppression in our country is the weaker for the traditionalist, conservative, and primitive restraints imposed on women by man-dominated structures within our movement, as also because of equally traditionalist attitudes of surrender and submission on the part of women.","Apartheid either is or is not. And it must not be.","In South Africa, I feel I am a stranger, at best an animal.","If apartheid is removed, then the violence that is necessary to maintain it will be removed along with the pressures from apartheid which create a violent response.","Those who want to perpetuate apartheid also seek to divert your attention to the false issue of communism, to send the entire American public on a witch hunt.","The apartheid system renounces no violence.","I didn't really want to be a teacher, but there was nothing else I could be. Most of those who went to the university became teachers. It was just the racial restriction on Africans.","We believe it is comprehensive international sanctions against the white regime that will save us from the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of South Africans, black and white.","There is nothing in ANC policy which calls for attacks on civilians in supermarkets, schools, and cinemas unless these are regarded as military installations.","Whites, like ourselves, belong to our country. They are compatriots, fellow citizens... we see them as Africans.","The people of South Africa are ready to stand up to the oppressions of the Pretoria regime, and they are ready to fight back.","Who is a terrorist? Is it not the person who has been persecuting human beings simply because they are black?"],"Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.":["A mind that is stretched by a new experience can never go back to its old dimensions.","A word is not a crystal, transparent and unchanged; it is the skin of a living thought and may vary greatly in color and content according to the circumstances and time in which it is used.","The advice of the elders to young men is very apt to be as unreal as a list of the hundred best books.","Life is painting a picture, not doing a sum.","If there is any principle of the Constitution that more imperatively calls for attachment than any other it is the principle of free thought, not free thought for those who agree with us but freedom for the thought that we hate.","A man is usually more careful of his money than of his principles.","Lawyers spend a great deal of their time shoveling smoke.","Through our great good fortune, in our youth our hearts were touched with fire. It was given to us to learn at the outset that life is a profound and passionate thing.","Life is an end in itself, and the only question as to whether it is worth living is whether you have had enough of it.","Every calling is great when greatly pursued.","When in doubt, do it.","Certitude is not the test of certainty. We have been cocksure of many things that were not so.","I think that we should be eternally vigilant against attempts to check the expression of opinions that we loathe and believe to be fraught with death, unless they so imminently threaten immediate interference with the lawful and pressing purposes of the law that an immediate check is required to save the country.","Beware how you take away hope from another human being.","Every now and then a man's mind is stretched by a new idea or sensation, and never shrinks back to its former dimensions.","The greatest act of faith is when a man understands he is not God.","Young man, the secret of my success is that at early age I discovered that I was not God.","It seems to me that at this time we need education in the obvious more than investigation of the obscure.","The main part of intellectual education is not the acquisition of facts, but learning how to make facts live.","To have doubted one's own first principles is the mark of a civilized man.","Most of the things we do, we do for no better reason than that our fathers have done them or our neighbors do them, and the same is true of a larger part than what we suspect of what we think.","The great act of faith is when a man decides he is not God.","I despise making the most of one's time. Half of the pleasures of life consist of the opportunities one has neglected.","Sin has many tools, but a lie is the handle which fits them all.","It is very lonely sometimes, trying to play God.","Between two groups of people who want to make inconsistent kinds of worlds, I see no remedy but force.","The mode by which the inevitable comes to pass is effort.","Men must turn square corners when they deal with the Government.","Any two philosophers can tell each other all they know in two hours.","Every idea is an incitement... eloquence may set fire to reason.","People talk fundamentals and superlatives and then make some changes of detail.","Even for practical purposes theory generally turns out the most important thing in the end.","A new untruth is better than an old truth.","The only prize much cared for by the powerful is power.","You make me chuckle when you say that you are no longer young, that you have turned twenty-four. A man is or may be young to after sixty, and not old before eighty.","The rule of joy and the law of duty seem to me all one.","If I were dying, my last words would be: Have faith and pursue the unknown end.","I have no respect for the passion of equality, which seems to me merely idealizing envy - I don't disparage envy, but I don't accept it as legitimately my master.","A new and valid idea is worth more than a regiment and fewer men can furnish the former than command the latter.","To be civilized is to be potentially master of all possible ideas, and that means that one has got beyond being shocked, although one preserves one's own moral aesthetic preferences.","On the whole, I am on the side of the unregenerate who affirms the worth of life as an end in itself, as against the saints who deny it.","The language of judicial decision is mainly the language of logic. And the logical method and form flatter that longing for certainty and for repose which is in every human mind. But certainty generally is illusion, and repose is not the destiny of man.","The rules of evidence in the main are based on experience, logic, and common sense, less hampered by history than some parts of the substantive law."],"Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.":["Where we love is home - home that our feet may leave, but not our hearts.","Love is the master key that opens the gates of happiness, of hatred, of jealousy, and, most easily of all, the gate of fear.","The Amen of nature is always a flower.","The young man knows the rules, but the old man knows the exceptions.","To reach a port we must sail, sometimes with the wind, and sometimes against it. But we must not drift or lie at anchor.","Truth is tough. It will not break, like a bubble, at a touch; nay, you may kick it about all day like a football, and it will be round and full at evening.","I find the great thing in this world is not so much where we stand, as in what direction we are moving: To reach the port of heaven, we must sail sometimes with the wind and sometimes against it - but we must sail, and not drift, nor lie at anchor.","But friendship is the breathing rose, with sweets in every fold.","It is the province of knowledge to speak, and it is the privilege of wisdom to listen.","The sound of a kiss is not so loud as that of a cannon, but its echo lasts a great deal longer.","Fresh air is good if you do not take too much of it; most of the achievements and pleasures of life are in bad air.","Controversy equalizes fools and wise men in the same way - and the fools know it.","There is no friend like an old friend who has shared our morning days, no greeting like his welcome, no homage like his praise.","Insanity is often the logic of an accurate mind overtasked.","Don't flatter yourselves that friendship authorizes you to say disagreeable things to your intimates. On the contrary, the nearer you come into relation with a person, the more necessary do tact and courtesy become.","Without wearing any mask we are conscious of, we have a special face for each friend.","Speak clearly, if you speak at all; carve every word before you let it fall.","Love prefers twilight to daylight.","Men do not quit playing because they grow old; they grow old because they quit playing.","Most people are willing to take the Sermon on the Mount as a flag to sail under, but few will use it as a rudder by which to steer.","We do not quit playing because we grow old, we grow old because we quit playing.","The mind of a bigot to the pupil of the eye; the more light you pour on it, the more it contracts.","Many ideas grow better when transplanted into another mind than in the one where they sprang up.","A person is always startled when he hears himself seriously called an old man for the first time.","Science is a first-rate piece of furniture for a man's upper chamber, if he has common sense on the ground-floor. But if a man hasn't got plenty of good common sense, the more science he has, the worse for his patient.","Every event that a man would master must be mounted on the run, and no man ever caught the reins of a thought except as it galloped past him.","A moment's insight is sometimes worth a life's experience.","To be seventy years young is sometimes far more cheerful and hopeful than to be forty years old.","Our brains are seventy-year clocks. The Angel of Life winds them up once for all, then closes the case, and gives the key into the hand of the Angel of the Resurrection.","Many people die with their music still in them. Why is this so? Too often it is because they are always getting ready to live. Before they know it, time runs out.","Put not your trust in money, but put your money in trust.","Memory is a net: one finds it full of fish when he takes it from the brook, but a dozen miles of water have run through it without sticking.","Some people are so heavenly minded that they are no earthly good.","It's faith in something and enthusiasm for something that makes a life worth living.","A woman never forgets her sex. She would rather talk with a man than an angel, any day.","The world is always ready to receive talent with open arms. Very often it does not know what to do with genius.","Language is the blood of the soul into which thoughts run and out of which they grow.","Don't you stay at home of evenings? Don't you love a cushioned seat in a corner, by the fireside, with your slippers on your feet?","Wisdom is the abstract of the past, but beauty is the promise of the future.","The real religion of the world comes from women much more than from men - from mothers most of all, who carry the key of our souls in their bosoms.","What a blessed thing it is, that Nature, when she invented, manufactured, and patented her authors, contrived to make critics out of the chips that were left!","Truth, when not sought after, rarely comes to light.","Stillness of person and steadiness of features are signal marks of good breeding.","Have the courage to act instead of react.","A goose flies by a chart which the Royal Geographical Society could not mend.","Apology is only egotism wrong side out.","The very aim and end of our institutions is just this: that we may think what we like and say what we think.","Chicago sounds rough to the maker of verse. One comfort we have - Cincinnati sounds worse.","Do not be bullied out of your common sense by the specialist; two to one, he is a pedant.","I think that, as life is action and passion, it is required of a man that he should share the passion and action of his time at peril of being judged not to have lived.","A great calamity is as old as the trilobites an hour after it has happened.","A pun does not commonly justify a blow in return. But if a blow were given for such cause, and death ensued, the jury would be judges both of the facts and of the pun, and might, if the latter were of an aggravated character, return a verdict of justifiable homicide.","I hate facts. I always say the chief end of man is to form general propositions - adding that no general proposition is worth a damn.","The world's great men have not commonly been great scholars, nor its great scholars great men.","I like children; I like 'em, and I respect 'em. Pretty much all the honest truth-telling there is in the world is done by them.","Sweet is the scene where genial friendship plays the pleasing game of interchanging praise.","A child's education should begin at least one hundred years before he is born.","Don't be 'consistent', but be simply true.","The man who is always worrying about whether or not his soul would be damned generally has a soul that isn't worth a damn.","A man may fulfill the object of his existence by asking a question he cannot answer, and attempting a task he cannot achieve.","Fame usually comes to those who are thinking about something else - very rarely to those who say to themselves, 'Go to, now, let us be a celebrated individual!'.","Grow we must, if we outgrow all that loves us.","Every real thought on every real subject knocks the wind out of somebody or other.","Why can't somebody give us a list of things that everybody thinks and nobody says, and another list of things that everybody says and nobody thinks?","Memories, imagination, old sentiments, and associations are more readily reached through the sense of smell than through any other channel.","A thought is often original, though you have uttered it a hundred times.","Simple people... are very quick to see the live facts which are going on about them.","Stupidity often saves a man from going mad.","People who honestly mean to be true really contradict themselves much more rarely than those who try to be 'consistent'.","Rough work, iconoclasm, but the only way to get at truth.","A few can touch the magic string, and noisy fame is proud to win them: Alas for those that never sing, but die with all their music in them!","Nothing is so common-place as to wish to be remarkable.","Every library should try to be complete on something, if it were only the history of pinheads."],"Olivia Colman":["I've always wanted to play a Marvel baddie. I'm not sure I fit the mold, though. Like a powerful, extraordinary woman. Somebody with superpowers would be really fun, but I'm not sure how many middle-aged women they have in Marvel.","I am a bit sickie happy. I am prone to black clouds too, but... I am embarrassed about them. It's like: 'My diamond shoes are too tight. My money clip doesn't fit all my fifties.' I mean - really. Shut up.","Dementia is such a terrifying thing for all of us, and we are particularly bad at coping with old people in this country.","You can over-think things. If the script's good, everything you need is in there. I just try and feel it and do it honestly. I also don't learn things for auditions, because I feel like it's just a test of memorising rather than being real.","As a child, I thought, 'Once I am a grown-up, there will be no more fear, no more worries,' and it turns out that's not true.","If the script's good, everything you need is in there. I just try and feel it, and do it honestly. I also don't learn things for auditions, because I feel like it's just a test of memorizing rather than being real. Maybe every other actor would think that was terrible, I don't know. But it seems to have worked for me, so far.","I'd feel bad pretending my life was anything other than pretty good, so I do the role as well as I can and then I go home, have a cup of tea, see my family and friends, and appreciate what I've got.","I was never one of those surly teenagers who doesn't smile. My lovely godfather said it was always lovely to see me because I was the only teenager who smiled. And I was so in awe of him, I thought it was one of the best things anyone had ever said to me. So it made me want to live up to what he said.","You see thousands of films you forget the minute you come out of the cinema, don't you? Because they don't mean anything. It's the tough ones like 'Breaking the Waves' and 'Nil By Mouth' that stay with you, that you never forget. I'd like to leave a few of those behind if possible.","I had a lovely, feral, free childhood - out and then come back when you're hungry or it gets too dark. I feel slightly cruel that I'm not offering my children the same.","Everything with me is pretty close to the surface, but having kids has completely ruined my emotional equilibrium.","I don't like the bullying, do-one-over style of comedy. It's so cheap.","If a script is good, you are 10 steps into the part just reading it. But my choices are not all down to my taste. It is about people you have worked with before.","In fact I was slightly badly behaved at school and got in trouble. I would get a bee in my bonnet about something I thought wasn't right, and I would ape about too, to make everybody laugh. That was my way through my girls' school, because I wasn't very academic.","I feel fortunate that I'm not a beauty. I'm not a classic beauty. I feel it is harder for girls who are like that. There are fewer parts.","I'm not a pin-up, thankfully. I'm not suggesting I feel unconfident. I am beautiful to my husband. I am beautiful to my friends. I feel sexy and all those things with the people I love.","I love my job and I know I am very lucky but still, if you audition and you don't get it, it still affects you.","If I didn't have children I might be more of a lush than I am. I like booze. I struggle with smoking. And I'm a big swearer. I'm trying to rein it in but I do think it's a nice seasoning of language.","The first time I did a school play was the first time I felt I was good at anything at all. I just loved it.","I always assumed I would leave drama school and do 'Lady Macbeth' and all sorts of serious things. It just didn't happen.","I always assumed I'd be a terribly patient mum but it turns out I'm not!","This may sound mad, but you sort of assume that no one's going to watch what you do. You go on set, have a lovely time, and then you forget anyone's going to see it. So it's always a bit of a shock to be recognized. I get terribly embarrassed.","Acting is playing, and it is like being a big kid. Yeah, it's great. You get paid.","In general, I'm rubbish in heels. I love them, and I own a lot because it's like being in a sweet shop: they're pretty. But I'm not good in them. I don't walk nicely in heels.","I can't bear kissing scenes.","Actually, lots of women, when they're pregnant, feel like steel. They feel incredible.","It gets slightly daunting if you're watching the telly and everybody's gorgeous. It's just so rubbish. And I'm grateful that it's not so much anymore - it's great to see.","I am just an actor - all I do is I memorise someone else's words and tart around.","I want to be helpful to the charities I support. I think you can dilute it, the more you do. You have to be a bit strong about what you do... otherwise, you risk spreading yourself a bit thin, and you can be less useful.","I'm always keen to have more training as a charity patron.","I grew up in north Norfolk, which certainly used to have an enormous sense of community. There are more and more second homes there now, so I'm not sure how that has damaged it. But where I live in South London, there is a beautiful community; it's the friendliest place I have ever lived, which comes as a surprise to non-Londoners.","My daughter's still so tiny at the moment; she's just a sweet little meaty thing. But of course, you always think about what you want for them, don't you, and like any parent I want my children to be happy more than anything.","I want everyone to know what they deserve in relationships: that they can demand equality and kindness. Because everyone will have a relationship at some point in their life. It's what we all do, every day, and we need to know how to do it.","I do sometimes wonder if people think, 'Oh we'll have her because she cries well.' The odd thing is I don't really know where it comes from. If the script is good, I find I can usually cry without too much trouble - in fact, the hard thing is trying to get me to stop. But I'm not really a crier in real life. I'm not a dramatic person, you see.","I was always pretty ambitious, although it probably helps that I can't do anything else - apart from cleaning lavatories. But I remember my mum once said, 'I suppose you'll give it a year and see if you can make it as an actress?' And I said, 'No Mum, I think I'll give it 10.'","After those first two BAFTAs, I didn't really get offered anything, which makes you think, 'Oh, no!' And, after I finished the second series of 'Broadchurch,' nothing came up for six months, which really is a long time, and I got a bit panicky.","I can see why people keep having babies. We were looking at a school for my youngest this morning, and there were all these little boys and girls. So sweet. And then the teenagers walk past, and, my God, they're enormous, and I bet they don't kiss their mummies. I'm just going to force my children to remain lovely.","I find Shakespeare terrifying. When Simon Russell Beale does a speech, I understand every word of it, but if I did the same speech, people would be going, 'Huh? What?'","I've always done drama, but I suppose 'Tyrannosaur' was a bit of a watershed moment for me. It was like when Kathy Burke did 'Nil By Mouth' - suddenly, people were saying, 'Oh, she can do that, too.'","I remember doing one of those computer careers tests. It told me I'd make an ideal HGV lorry driver because I've got 100 per cent spatial awareness. I'd be able to back them into tight parking spots.","I did a forward roll for the kids the other day, thinking it'd be a breeze like it was when I was six, and I had to lie flat for about 20 minutes afterwards - 'Leave mummy alone; she's feeling a bit dizzy.'","If something touches me, I cry. That's it. I'm a bit raw, a bit rubbish, really. Often, a director will say to me, 'I don't think this is a scene where your character cries.' And all I can say is, good luck with that!","I don't think you can cry if the script is rubbish. I have to feel it; it's as simple as that. It's just like if you're watching something moving, and you feel yourself welling up. It's the same thing. You're just being carried along with the story. There's nothing magical about it. I think I'm in touch with my emotions, and I can't help it.","I think I remember being held by my mum as a baby.","I've been with my husband and friends for so long, I've forgotten what is unappealing to new people.","Proper love should be utterly supportive and comfortable, and it feels like a raincoat or a jacket potato.","I spent years commuting into London when I was working as a temp, and I hated the monotony of it.","I used to want to be in 'Downton' because I had never been in a period drama, but then I did 'The Suspicions of Mr Whicher' and had to wear one of those frocks and... I didn't feel very comfortable.","I suppose I have played a lot of put-upon women, but it's never bothered me. They've never been weak - they've always got steel in them.","I eat a bit too much; my teeth aren't perfect; I've got eye bags. I look like a normal 39-year-old woman - but in England, no one minds that.","My mum was a nurse, and her passion was geriatric care. I used to love listening to the old people's stories in her nursing home and picturing myself in their place. They'd say, 'I went to school in a horse and cart,' and I'd just think 'Wow!' I'd picture myself in their place - acting was a natural progression.","When you've got children, it's easy to do that thing of keeping a tally of who woke up earliest and whose turn it is to put them to bed. But I think the important thing is to appreciate and love each other and to show that appreciation.","I think a good dollop of sadness is quite a useful thing in comedy sometimes. I think if everyone's happy all the time, it's a bit dull. It's like salt and caramel - you wouldn't imagine they would go well together, but they do.","I think each person you play has a little bit of you in it - you can't really help that.","I don't have a process; I just feel it. My book on acting would be very short.","I'm really enjoying being able to do these unhinged comedies and emotional dramas alike. I'm having a lovely time. After shooting a role that requires months of crying, it's quite nice to be able to play something very different.","I am a perfectly normal woman. If what we do is storytelling and represent people that we see all day and every day, well, we do not see supermodels all day and every day.","I have done Botox, and I loved it.","I was rubbish at school.","My older brother, who was in the Army, now owns his own building company. My half-sister was a nurse and is now a psychotherapist.","I've been working a long time; it was a slow burn. But I'm grateful it's been like that.","I was nervous about meeting Charlotte Rampling, as she's a proper legend, but she is just so sweet.","Everybody laughs all the time, and some of the worst things that happen make you laugh 'cause it's a defense isn't it, I suppose.","I started off in comedy, but that's just where I got my work. I've always been an actor.","I open the doors for everybody all the time.","For some reason, people imagine that dramatic things happen to people who don't look beautiful.","I do go into things thinking, 'Right. I'm going to enjoy this.'","If people still trust me with a funny line, then that is fine. If that is what gets me work.","There was nothing about 'The Killing' that patronized its audience, and it was quite slow and detailed, all of the things which, for a long time, people had been nervous of making.","To play something which is a big spectrum is so much more fun, so much more of a challenge."],"Olivia Cooke":["In life, I'm pretty low-key and quite non-descript.","I can't keep secrets about myself. I can keep secrets about other people, but if it's about myself, I'm like, 'blah blah blah blah.'","My dad's an ex-policeman, and my mum is a sales representative, and they haven't got the acting bug. Bless them.","I did ballet and gymnastics, and then I started acting when I was eight - just doing amateur theater at a place called Oldham Theatre Workshop in my hometown.","My first big role was when I was 17 and I got the part playing Maria in 'West Side Story' in my school production.","When I was filming 'Ouija,' there were some elements in that that really creeped me out.","'The Quiet Ones' was my first film, let alone my first horror film, and I had so much fun. I had such a laugh, every single day. I look like such a feral child in it.","If I love the character, then that's all that matters to me. It doesn't really matter what genre it is."],"Olivia Culpo":["I think that, if anything, the pageant is great for people who suffer from body issues. It's all about being comfortable with what you're given and what you have and being able to flaunt it without being insecure. It's about empowering women, not making them feel weak or less.","The whole process of winning the pageant has been so amazing, I'm really excited to move forward into all kinds of projects.","You're filmed that one very special day of the pageant, and you want to make sure you're as ready to go as you can be.","I was taught to value hard work. At the end of day, I'm just Olivia.","If you're comfortable with yourself, then you'll look beautiful. If you're not feeling comfortable with yourself, than that kind of shows. I think that as cheesy as the pageant industry can be seen at times, it actually does help women - boosting their confidence and growing into their own. I have to give it credit for that.","I have to have coffee in the morning.","Heartbreak is hard, but you find more and more things to be grateful for every day.","I learned the importance of being confident. I think that at the end of the day, it's not so much about what you look like - it's really about the way that you feel. That resonates with people.","I tried putting teabags under my eyes because they say that the green tea - the caffeine - will help with under-eye bags and moisture. It worked! That's a new tip.","I think the pageant system is about empowering women. I think that aspect of it is great, but when you take parents who are forcing their children to do anything, I don't think it's healthy.","Ryan Gosling's, like, my crush, but I don't really pay attention to his personal style.","Well I love preppy style; I like J. Crew for guys.","I was studying communications and acting, and I decided over the summer that I wanted to work on my acting skills and perform in a pageant. I didn't have any other way of practicing, so I entered the Miss Rhode Island pageant. I ended up wearing a dress that was a $20 rental. It was too short, and there was a hole in the back of it.","I want a gentleman. Someone with manners.","I wash my face day and night. I actually really love Dr. Lancer face wash, and I also love Neutrogena.","I love Evian face spray because it's a really easy way to just freshen up your face, especially if you're traveling on an airplane - I get really dry on airplanes.","I'm a real girly-girl.","The pageant movie I'm obsessed with is 'Miss Congeniality', hands down! I could quote everything from that movie. I love so many scenes, but I always find myself quoting the scene when Sandra Bullock goes, 'I really do just want world peace!'","The show I'm obsessed with watching is 'Say Yes to the Dress!' Because I love the whole makeover idea, and I'm a sap for love, of course.","I love unsalted almonds, especially if I'm about to do a photo shoot or compete. There's no mess, and they're so easy to pack in a little Ziploc bag to take with you. It's my number one go-to snack!","Pineapple reduces swelling.","We have little bags we pack specifically for touch-up makeup if you're chosen for the top 16. I knew I had to sneak in my banana because nothing calms my nerves like it! I don't know if it's the potassium, but I need it before I get on stage because it always calms me down.","Every day is a blessing.","I love music. I still play cello a few times a week.","My parents are both musicians and made sure we all played music. My brothers and sisters all play instruments, so we'll get together whenever we can and play. We play a lot of classical music - you know, the good stuff.","I'm still really interested in acting, I love film so much. It's definitely something I'm going to explore as well.","This is a free country, and to each their own.","I do want to finish my education. I just don't think that Boston has a big enough market for what I want to do.","If you think that your child is going to be really sensitive to the fact that they might not win - which they probably won't - you shouldn't do it because it's not healthy if they get the feeling that they're not good enough or they're not worthy.","It really comes down to being able to inspire others by being comfortable with yourself. You have to show girls that everyone is different; everyone has things they don't like, but they work it and walk the runway.","There is no ideal body. It's just taking what you have and working it."],"Olivia De Havilland":["I would prefer to live forever in perfect health, but if I must at some time leave this life, I would like to do so ensconced on a chaise longue, perfumed, wearing a velvet robe and pearl earrings, with a flute of champagne beside me and having just discovered the answer to the last problem in a British cryptic crossword.","How many women in this world are served breakfast in bed every morning by a gorgeous young man? I am. So how do I feel about older age? Crazy about it! Wouldn't trade it for anything!","I'm certainly relishing the idea of living a century. Can you imagine that? What an achievement.","Famous people feel that they must perpetually be on the crest of the wave, not realising that it is against all the rules of life. You can't be on top all the time, it isn't natural.","The TV business is soul crushing, talent destroying and human being destroying.","I read the Scriptures at the American Cathedral on Christmas and Easter; that's it. It's a task I love.","I feel like a survivor from an age that people no longer understand. I want to try to explain what the 1930s - the golden age of Hollywood - was truly like. People forget that America was such a different place then, not yet the dominant force in the world.","The one thing that you simply have to remember all the time that you are there, is that Hollywood is an oriental city. As long as you do that you might survive. If you try to equate it with anything else you'll perish.","We were like a stock company at Warners. We didn't know any of the stars from the other studios.","Playing good girls in the 30s was difficult, when the fad was to play bad girls. Actually I think playing bad girls is a bore; I have always had more luck with good girl roles because they require more from an actress.","There certainly is such a thing as screen chemistry, although I don't believe you find it frequently.","I don't need a fantasy life as once I did. That is the life of the imagination that I had a great need for. Films were the perfect means for satisfying that need.","I had a very big crush on Errol Flynn during 'Captain Blood.' I thought he was absolutely smashing for three solid years, but he never guessed. Then he had one on me but nothing came of it. I'm not going to regret that; it could have ruined my life.","I was just a mini-star when we did 'Gone With the Wind.'","I don't feel the cold. It's my British blood!","I was quite thin, and I didn't have to worry until I had my appendix out and a mysterious metabolic change occurred.","If I watch 'Gone With the Wind,' I always find it interesting. I think, 'What's going to happen next? What's that character going to do?' But you know, you never really need to watch the films you made again. They stay inside you, always with you.","I wanted to be what my high-school civics and history teacher thought of as a good American. That automatically involved taking an interest in government.","I'm all for typewriters, with instant carbon copies, and seeing films in cinemas.","I felt 'Gone with the Wind' would last five years, and it's lasted over 70 and into a new millennium. There is a special place in my heart for that film and Melanie. She was a remarkable character - a loving person - and because of that, she was a happy person. And Scarlett, of course, was not.","I am attracted by almost any French word - written or spoken. Before I knew its meaning, I thought 'saucisson' so exquisite that it seemed the perfect name to give a child - until I learned it meant 'sausage!'","I loved France, although I initially thought they were stubborn for always speaking French.","By 1951, television had already made such inroads on the income garnered by motion picture companies that the Golden Era which had prevailed until then was beginning to disintegrate. And by 1953, it had come to an end. Hollywood was a dismal, tragic place.","There are no words to describe my feelings for Errol Flynn.","I was naturalized right before Pearl Harbor. Nine days later, I would have been classified as an enemy alien. I might have been sent to a camp.","When I was five, I discovered a secret box that contained Mummy's stage makeup. It was like finding buried treasure. I tried the rouge, the eye shadow, the lipstick. But I couldn't get the rouge off. Mummy spanked me terribly.","I wouldn't wish overnight success on anyone. You have no real friends. Everyone works endless hours at different studios, so far apart. Even on your own lot, relationships were formal and often competitive.","I have, indeed, lived most of my life overseas, but I've returned repeatedly to work in film, special television productions, and the New York theater. There have also been tributes and similar occasions that have called me back to Hollywood. I've returned so often, I almost feel that I've never left.","What bothered me was playing one-dimensional parts in films which were really about, 'Boy Meets Girl,' 'Will Boy Get Girl?'","All of Hollywood was convinced that 'Gone with the Wind' would be a colossal disaster and rather hoped it would be.","I would watch anything with Meryl Streep in it.","I have the idea that anyone who has ever heard my name has the distinct impression that I was put under the sod years ago just before they buried Lillian Russell."],"Olivia DeJonge":["I have two tutors - a maths tutor and another tutor who does all the other subjects. It is part of the deal with myself; I really want to finish school. I like learning and education, and I think it is really important.","I can't even remember when I first went, 'I want to be an actress.' It's always been inside of me.","When I was younger, I did lots of plays, put on shows for Mum and Dad, made my brother dress up in ridiculous tutus and whatnot to perform in front of them. I think my pre-primary report was like, 'Has a flair for drama' - it was just a little side note.","With all the auditions you do, there is a lot of rejection you have to take as well. You get used to that.","I've done more than 70 auditions in about four years. Early on, it was hard for me because I'd become so attached to these characters, and then you'd be told, 'No.' I'd get very upset when I was younger. But now it comes with the territory.","Being flown to the U.S. to meet Sofia Coppola is really exciting. I was freaking out. I'm a little nervous, as I don't want to muck it up I want to do my best."],"Olivia Holt":["I am thankful for all the blessings and talents I have been given, but most of all I am thankful for my loving and supportive family.","I watched the Disney Channel all the time growing up. 'Lizzie McGuire' was my all-time favorite. I'm pretty sure I had every piece of merchandise that involved Lizzie. And I loved 'That's So Raven.'","I think people would be most surprised to know that I love scary movies.","I would love to work with Reese Witherspoon.","My style is very simple, but I love Reese Witherspoon, Kate Hudson and Kate Middleton.","The 'Kickin' It' set is so much fun, I find myself in a new adventure every week. I work with an amazing cast and crew.","I would love to learn how to dance. I can pick up choreography pretty well. But when you're dancing with your friends, I can't do that. I'm not a freestyler. It just doesn't come naturally to me. Clapping is my go-to dance.","Working with Disney is really and truly like working with a family. Everyone is so supportive and so wonderful. I've worked with Disney since I was twelve, and they've given me so many opportunities that I'll forever be grateful for.","What's great about working on a sitcom is that I spend so much time with people who are in other fields as well, such as writing, directing, and/or camera operating. Being on set is like being on a playground. I go from one thing to the next, and I've learned so much and hope to continue learning.","I have an obsession with Milk Duds. Eating them tastes like heaven.","I would definitely trade clothes with Lucy Hale. Her fashion sense is right on point, and I feel like she's never afraid to take risks with her clothes.","I'm a huge 'Call of Duty' fan, 'Minecraft' and all those kinds of video games. I'm constantly playing video games every day.","I feel like something I've wanted to do for a really long time, in a feature film or anything, is playing a rocker. Somewhere where I can be on a stage and have a guitar or a microphone and just kind of jam out.","My family loves to take me out, and we do regular things like go to the movies. My friends do that as well. At the same time, I love work and I want to be busy all the time!","Ever since I was really little, I loved performing and being up on stage, and being the entertainment.","I think that it's really incredible, growing up and being able to have all these people who really look up to the work that I do. It's really cool that I have such awesome fans, and I can't thank them enough. I get on my Twitter and Facebook every day, and I see such awesome things.","I'm all about scary movies! The 'Halloweentown' ones are my absolute favorites.","I want to be able to make people laugh and cry and feel happy or sad and feel all these different emotions through singing and acting. Hopefully throughout my career, I'll get to pursue them.","One year, I was a go-go girl for Halloween, and I got all this glitter eye shadow, my hair was poufy with braids, I was wearing all these different colors and fake eyelashes that went all the way up to my eyebrows. I totally enjoy the whole Halloween feel.","I was involved in a bunch of school activities - I was a cheerleader, I was on the chess team, I was vice president of my class."],"Olivia Hussey":["I've always believed in a higher power. You can call it God, you can call it Jesus, Krishna, Buddha, Allah, I don't care. I really believe we are all a part of God.","I am such a diehard romantic. I guess a part of me thinks I am Juliet.","When I was a little girl, I used to walk around with a towel on my head, pretending I was a nun. And then one day my mother said, 'Why don't you just become an actress, and then you can pretend you're a nun.'","I would love to spend more time in Britain one day. In my heart, I still feel that I'm English, and when I think of home, I think of England.","Performers are the neediest people in the world. Unless you've been in that goldfish bowl - nobody can judge unless they've worn those shoes.","I used to say that my own father was dead, because he might as well have been. He was in Argentina and didn't play a part in my life. He and my mother divorced when I was only two.","It's true that youth is wasted on the young and, if I had my life to live over again, I suppose I would pay more attention to my career. I would make better choices. But, in my defence, I would say that I have three wonderful children, and that's something I am very proud of.","I had played the Virgin Mary in 'Jesus of Nazareth,' and I had done 'Juliet' at the age of 15. People said, 'Where do you go from playing Juliet and the Virgin Mary?' And I said, 'Mother Teresa of Calcutta.'","In a perfect world, I only act when I really want to. I don't do most of the stuff that is out there, but it's a joy and a pleasure to do anything that promotes this higher power - this light, if you will. I just think there aren't enough projects in the world that do that.","I'm one of those actresses that really enjoys staying home with my children. To be told you've got to get to work, it is just unbelievable what it does to you."],"Olivia Munn":["I think women should start to embrace their age. What's the alternative to getting older? You die. I can't change the day I was born. But I can take care of my skin, my body, my mind, and try to live my life and be happy.","Everyone's so timid and afraid to insult anybody, but in the end, it's like we're all trying to please everyone. In the end, we please no one.","The word 'geek' today does not mean what it used to mean. A geek isn't the skinny kid with a pocket protector and acne. There can be computer geeks, video game geeks, car geeks, military geeks, and sports geeks. Being a geek just means that you're passionate about something.","I was a big fan of Super Troopers, so working with the Broken Lizard guys was so much fun.","I want you to like me, but I don't care if you don't.","Everyone is just nicer to prettier people.","I think it's always funny when somebody thinks you're going to do something super sexy and then you don't.","I'm easy to hate. I get it.","I never tried to use anything besides my own sweat and blood and talent to get somewhere.","I hate running. I know I'm curvier - I know I'm small, but I'm not ripped. But I make a choice to be that way. I realize my arms aren't as toned as Halle Berry's but I don't want them to be.","I'm a much more chill person now that I know who I am and know my own voice, so I don't really get nervous with live TV at all.","I was in a military family, so by the time I was 13 I'd lived in six different places.","I just broke up with my boyfriend, so I'm officially single. But one thing I find unbelievably annoying is all these guys in my life who want to save me.","For 'Iron Man' I had to improv with Robert Downey Jr., which is like going up against LeBron in basketball. At one point he stopped and said, 'Can we give a round of applause to Olivia, because she's rocking it right now.'","If you think something's funny, go with that. Most comedians pull jokes from a place of honesty.","I love my career right now, and I won't be with anybody until they make my life as satisfying and as happy as my work makes me.","I got to play with Nintendo's Wii, yes it's a funny name and not very revolutionary but it was fun whipping your arms around.","Basically, I'm living the life of an actress in L.A. And I've recently had some pretty good fortune.","I am the same on camera as I am off. I can't imagine being any other way.","I'm really sarcastic. Not Morgan Webb sarcastic. She's dry, 100%. I'm different from her.","I'm easy to hate.","A geek isn't the skinny kid with a pocket protector and acne. There can be computer geeks, video game geeks, car geeks, military geeks, and sports geeks. Being a geek just means that you're passionate about something.","I literally hate working out.","I realize my arms aren't as toned as Halle Berry's but I don't want them to be.","I love dressing up in superhero outfits and in fact, when I dress up as Wonder Woman, I actually think that I'm more powerful.","Probably the geekiest attribute that I have of them all is that I've always had a hard time meeting friends. Like no matter where I grew up and I moved around, I always had a hard time.","I grew up in a military family. I was moved around from school to school, so people aren't always the most welcoming to new girls in school.","If you stand up for women, then don't bash me.","Jon Stewart hires people that he thinks are funny. That's it. That's the only requirement.","I don't find myself to be the kind of person who is easily swayed.","I'm very open about the fact that it's nice when someone says you're pretty. Especially for someone like me.","It is possible in this world to be pretty and funny and successful all at the same time.","I have a dark sense of humor."],"Olivia Newton-John":["I don't know what my path is yet. I'm just walking on it.","My family and friends were definitely the key to my recovery. One thing that I do suggest is that anyone dealing with a life-threatening illness like cancer choose a point person for people to call to find out how you are doing - a sister, brother, mother, father, daughter, son, or close friend.","You never know what the future holds, so I am just enjoying being happy, healthy, and having my wonderful husband by my side.","I'm happy, and I think being happy keeps you looking young.","Being in love is the best thing in my life.","To me luxury is to be at home with my daughter, and the occasional massage doesn't hurt.","I love to design and remodel houses, from working with the contractors to picking the colours, materials, kitchen and bathroom accessories to finally what furniture goes where.","I live every day to its fullest extent and I don't sweat the small stuff.","I used homeopathy, acupuncture, yoga and meditation in conjunction with my chemotherapy to help me get stronger again after the cancer. I also chanted with Buddhist friends and prayed with Christian friends. I covered all my bases.","I love that quiet time when nobody's up and the animals are all happy to see me.","Most women don't do regular breast self examinations, mainly because they are either intimidated by what they might find, or they're confused as to how to do the self exam correctly. 'Liv Aid' eliminates all of these concerns because it makes breast self exams easy to perform.","I feel very passionately that we need to take care of the planet and everything on it. Whether it's saving the Amazon or just being kind to those around you, we need to take care of each other and Mother Earth.","I love life and nothing intimidates me anymore.","My memories are inside me - they're not things or a place - I can take them anywhere.","Nature is the most beautiful thing we have. It's better than art because it's from the creator.","My cancer scare changed my life. I'm grateful for every new, healthy day I have. It has helped me prioritize my life.","'Grease' changed my life in the most amazing way, and I've had such an amazing life. When things go wrong, you've got to believe you will get through them and focus on the positive things in your life.","The only weights I lift are my dogs.","Family, nature and health all go together.","When I was a young girl, I was so crazy about animals that I wanted to do something associated with them, and I thought of being a vet. But then again, I figured I had to go to medical school, and science wasn't a good subject for me, so I dropped the idea pretty soon and thought maybe I could be a vet's assistant.","I remember as a little girl I could tell you the name of the dog next door, but I couldn't tell you the names of the kids. The dog was my best friend. I love animals. They give so much to you and demand so little.","I simply have a marvellous life, a very lucky life.","We print 37 million copies, and we found out about the unfortunate news as we were putting the issue to bed.","I feel alive, fit and active. I have no plans for retirement. My only concession to getting a little older is that I like to have a cat-nap in the afternoon. After that, I can push on through anything.","Genetically, I'm like my mum, and she looked great right up until her death in 1989.","Nothing I have done professionally will top the feeling I got when singing with John Farnham at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney.","There's a rumor going around that I'm Miss Goody-two-shoes from Australia. Well, that's a laugh. I'm really Miss Goody-two-shoes from England!","There's a balance in my life. There's reality, and there's the part that looks really glamorous, but we're all just people in the end.","When I first arrived in America, the very first place I came was California, and I rented a house in Trance, which is about half an hour from Malibu.","My father was a headmaster in England and then the dean of a college in Australia. We moved there when I was about five, so my education was in Australia, and I always felt I was Australian even though my passport was British.","I am fortunate to have the ability to lend my name to build the Olivia Newton-John Cancer and Wellness Centre in my hometown of Melbourne. It will be a state-of-the-art facility to help heal the whole person - body, mind and spirit.","My father had the most amazing operatic voice, so I have a soft spot for that.","Men need to be aware of the health of their bodies, as well - prostate cancer and breast cancer are almost on the same level. It's fascinating to me that the correlation between the two is almost the same - people don't talk about it so much, but they are almost equal in numbers.","In June 1992, I discovered a lump in my breast. A subsequent mammogram, ultrasound and a needle biopsy proved negative. But my instinct said it still didn't feel right, so I had a lumpectomy. I then got the news that it was cancer.","I'm a very light sleeper. I get about six hours a night.","I've been through cancer, divorce, loss and bereavement, but they are things most humans go through.","I still can't believe I danced with Gene Kelly. How lucky am I that I've been in movies where I've danced with two of the greatest dancers of all time - with Gene Kelly and John Travolta.","It feels really good to give back. I'm opening the Olivia Newton-John Cancer Wellness Centre in Australia.","I'm so happy with 'Grease' and 'Xanadu,' particularly because of the music in both films.","Professionally, when I did the Olympic games and sang for my country in Australia. It was a big moment, Sydney in 2000. It was just a brilliant moment in my life.","I made an album of healing music called 'Grace and Gratitude' that came from my soul.","I always suggest that when you're going through cancer to find something in your day that makes you feel centered and that makes you feel good.","I've always been aware of my health - when you are having to go on stage and perform, you need to be feeling good - but when I was diagnosed with a life-threatening illness, I became really, really conscious of my health.","Eating disorders are usually nothing to do with food. Parents need to be with their child to see them through it. All the therapists in the world can't help if the parents aren't present, loving, and proactive.","The 'Great Walk to Beijing' was a fundraiser for my cancer center. It was a three-week trek with fellow cancer 'thrivers,' including celebrities ranging from Joan Rivers to Leeza Gibbons and Olympians."],"Olivia Thirlby":["I think we all suffer from acute blindness at times. Life is a constant journey of trying to open your eyes. I'm just beginning my journey, and my eyes aren't fully open yet.","I don't believe that if I came out as bisexual the world will change. But it's really important for people to be truthful about who they are and fight for equality. We need to help the world usher itself into the next phase.","My hobbies include maintaining my physical and mental health. It's a full-time job. Yoga definitely helps for both of them. I'm a big fan of relaxing and not having a schedule. That's my best way to keep from going crazy.","My hair had been dyed blonde for 'Dredd.' After 'Dredd,' I was really fried because of the blonde hair dye, and so I cut it into a bob with bangs and that's how it was during 'Being Flynn.'","I feel like it's always about embracing what it is that you think is wrong with you. It's often times your greatest 'flaw' which actually forays into what is also your greatest strength.","I'd always wanted to be an action heroine. That's a chick dream, getting to wear a leather bodysuit and be blonde and kick ass. But, what really attracted me to 'Dredd' was the script. It was fantastic! It was about people and characters, and not just about explosions and fighting.","I can't give more than I have. It doesn't matter if I am the most beautiful person in the room. There is inevitably going to be somebody way shinier and more tan than my pasty self.","I trained in Shakespeare, and that's all comedy, even when it's tragedy.","I go where the material is, and I feel like I'm looking for really strong directors. That's the key ingredient. There are some directors I would move the sun and earth for, or stop the rotation of the planets, just to work with them.","I can say I love working with women. Film is a man's world, and I really appreciate the opportunity to collaborate with women, especially young women.","I don't think I'm the world's most die-hard sci-fi fan, but I definitely grew up watching 'Star Trek' religiously - all of them: the original, 'Next Generation,' 'Deep Space Nine,' 'Voyager.' I think sci-fi has an important place in the cinema world. Fantasy is a big part of why films actually exist.","I had this totally impossible dream of being an actress. Trust me, just because I'm lucky enough to be doing this doesn't make any of this less of a pipe dream. And nothing gets my juices flowing like a really great performance. To see someone on stage, I get really excited.","I feel naked without jewelry. If I'm having a bad hair day, I pick something from my huge collection of hats.","'Red Knot' is a film that I shot in Antarctica almost three years ago on a boat. It was a film that was improvised and it had very interesting circumstances while making the film, obviously. We were on a small boat bobbing around in Antarctica. It was a really remarkable experience.","'The Movie' is something that I made with some friends of mine in L.A. My friend, Luke Eberl, is the filmmaker. He shot this movie and asked a bunch of his friends to be involved with it. I just saw him the other day and there is no money to finish the film. But, you know, I literally have a cameo in it.","I'm such a homebody. I don't party. I don't drink. That may be because I got it out all out of my system before I was 18.","There's very little you're not exposed to in New York City, in terms of ideas and physical things - sights, sounds, smells, different kinds of people. But one good thing about growing up fast is you get over it fast, too.","But I loved doing the physical stuff for 'Dredd.' I have to give a shout-out to the stunt team that I worked with.","But I would say maybe just from an actress's perspective, probably 'Woman Under the Influence' is the best movie of all time. The style of filmmaking and the performances... you don't feel like you're watching a film.","There's so much with my character in 'Dredd' that I identify with. She's my favorite character I think I've ever played. She's the most dynamic and fascinating woman that I could even imagine playing, so I love her. What I love about her is that her sensitivity is her greatest strength.","When I was starting out, I always wanted to be able to do everything - comedy and drama and action, and everything in between. Film is so diverse, and it's fun to be able to take advantage of all of it.","When we were filming 'The Darkest Hour,' we didn't even know what the aliens were going to look like, we didn't even have a graphic reference. So it was definitely a big challenge to sell those kind of extreme moments when you're just generating them from your own imagination.","To be honest, I wasn't a sci-fi geek at all. But I do love a good sci-fi film, especially one that can really take you away. And I read some reality-bending novels growing up, like stuff by Vonngeut, so I already had one part my brain open to the unnatural and unusual, and it's generally fun to venture into that world and film in it.","I still audition a lot and work really hard to get work. So I don't really walk around feeling like I've made it. My short term goals are really just to be creatively stimulated and to be excited about material I might be working on.","The older I get and the longer I live in New York City, the more I have the desire to go elsewhere and be surrounded by nature.","I love to cook. My dad's a really excellent cook and his style is: Look in the fridge and make whatever there is with whatever ingredients you have and I like cooking like that, too.","My boyfriend and I just got a projector, so we've been screening movies on the roof and projecting them against the wall next door. The last one we did, the theme was, 'The Russians are coming.' So we screened 'Red Dawn' and 'Top Gun.'","I do, I kick major butt in 'Dredd.' I get to kill people. I break a guy's neck by roundhouse kicking him in the face. It was me, I did it. I learned how to roundhouse kick. I also do it with my hands cuffed behind my back so it's pretty cool I have to say. Yeah, leather body suit, blonde hair, the whole thing.","Any filmmaking, any film is a collaborative process. There's always a lot of people working on things together.","I did 'Nobody Walks' right after 'Dredd.' Well, actually, I got off the plane from Capetown where we shot 'Dredd' and tested for 'Being Flynn' that same day. Then I came out to L.A. to make this film right after that so it was all very back to back.","Oh, I love making independent films, it's such a special, magical thing because you collaborate with a small group of people and everyone's pitching in. You'll see producers setting up the lunch table and the sound guy driving a van. We're all really there because we want to be.","I didn't have an incredibly active social life as a teenager. I always wished it was a little bit more exciting than it was.","I am always plagued with 'I'm not skinny enough, I'm not in shape.' I am not naturally this super-svelte kind of girl. I'm okay with that in my personal life. But it is kind of hard at times. I feel inadequate, I suppose?","I'm not an eye-candy kind of girl.","Acting is something that I always wanted, but I never paid attention to the notion that it might actually work out. You have all sorts of ideas about what you want to do - at one stage, I wanted to be a jockey - but this is the one that's a big deal."],"Olivia Wilde":["I have very high standards for every part of life - my work, my relationships, food, love. I can't just pretend.","It's so important to have that independence. You know it yourself: Everyone needs evenings of their own.","I think what ruins relationships and causes most fights is insecurity.","I used to experiment all the time with my hair color.","Documentaries are a powerful and effective way of bridging the gap between worlds, breaking through to new audiences that wouldn't otherwise be engaged - in essence, not preaching to the choir.","I think it's very healthy to spend time alone. You need to know how to be alone and not be defined by another person.","I think that women are more sensitive to emotional infidelity than men. I think men are more scared of physical infidelity.","But even if I'm left high and dry at the end of this wild journey, just taking it is a great feeling.","If you fall off a horse, you get back up. I am not a quitter.","Only the really young are fearless, have the optimism, the romanticism to take unimaginable risks.","I remember walking into drugstores when I was younger and seeing all the hair color boxes on the shelves and just being so in awe. Having the control to dye your hair and change your look is such a part of self-expression.","If I have to draw attention away from some hormone-induced acne on my chin, I put on a lot of mascara.","A lot of people assume that women of a certain age who are not unattractive have no excuse for not having a perfect life. But you can have emotional baggage that is dragging you down like cement blocks tied to your feet.","Once, in Australia, I ate 33 pancakes in 20 minutes, and I only did it because they said a girl could never enter the competition.","If I'm left high and dry at the end of this wild journey, just taking it is a great feeling.","Cleanses and products don't make you look more beautiful. They certainly help, but if you reach contentment, you're set. My makeup artist, Melanie Iglesias, couldn't figure out why my skin looks so good. I think it's because I'm happy!","I'm pretty low-key; you'll often find me in jeans, a T-shirt and sweatshirt.","I'm in no way suggesting that my opinion matters more than anyone else's, of course, but the only thing that bothers me is apathy. People that sit out of the process and complain about it, or pretend that politics isn't a part of their everyday lives.","I went to a very progressive elementary school where I was heavily educated in civil rights. I remember learning about Harvey Milk when I was in sixth or seventh grade and being so inspired.","The thing that's wonderful about social media is that we are able to give a voice to the voiceless and to help educate each other. I benefit from it as much as I provide those lessons.","I'm a natural blonde, but I feel like a brunette. I feel like people treat me now how I should be treated. People used to be shocked, when I was blond, that I wasn't stupid.","Oh God, to think that you only fall in love once in your entire life is such a depressing thought.","I feel like the luckiest child in the world because I got to grow up in Ireland. In summer is when you really grow up. During the year, I would go back to the States, and all year long really couldn't wait to get back to Ardmore.","At the end of your twenties, you realize you are inherently flawed, and that's great, and that's what makes you dynamic.","I went through a phase when I was 13 where I would only fall in love with people over the age of 19 or 20. I never had a real relationship with any of these people, but it was definitely the guy I wanted to hang out with and wanted to go on trips with. I would be like, 'But, Daddy, he's a musician!'.","My dad is Irish. I spent my childhood going back and forth between Ireland and America.","I am so saddened and grossed out by young women who look like creepy, old aliens because of their new Barbie noses and lips. Is that a smile or a grimace?","Obviously, local elections are where you can make the most difference, but it's great when everyone starts talking about what they believe in.","Early on, I knew I had ideas, but I wasn't sure when it was appropriate to bring them to the table, and I was so intimidated by these titans that I was working for. But it started around the time of 'Tron,' when I was really excited by the creative process and the prep that went into that. I spoke up often at those writing sessions.","I actually happened to be in Haiti right before the earthquake in 2010. I was there already with the organization I work with now, Artists for Peace and Justice, visiting the primary school that I had adopted, the Academy for Peace and Justice in Port-au-Prince. I came back, and within days, the earthquake happened.","It's interesting having a son. Someone told me that it's good when you have a son first because when you have a daughter first and then a son, you think your son's slow. A lot of parents freak out because they've seen a daughter progress so quickly, and they think their male child is, like, damaged. But boys are just naturally slow.","I fell in love with theater there, and after graduation I moved to Los Angeles to pursue acting.","I got an internship with the casting director of The Girl Next Door. I would hold the clipboard and help them in their casting sessions and get them lunch.","I was a handful growing up.","Now I'm doing a film festival for kids and writing a script about a kidnapped journalist in Afghanistan.","Once I took a bus from my home in Maryland to Philadelphia to live on the streets with some musicians for a few weeks, and then my parents sent me to boarding school at Andover to shape me up.","So many people have said that to me, that what they really like about Alex is what she brings out in Marissa, and what this situation brings out in her, a hint of happiness and another side to her character.","When you choose to be an actor, you are going against the odds.","The mark of a good marriage is partnership and continuing to feel inspired by your spouse. I had that with Tao. But the end is not necessarily the tragedy. Staying in a relationship that is no longer working is the tragedy. Living unhappily - that's the tragedy.","I'm opening up my heart to the idea of dating. It's funny - my friends would always come to me for romantic advice. I know nothing, and things have changed since I was dating in high school! I'm really trying hard to spend this time working on myself.","From a very early age, I made my decisions based on careers that I admire. The one thing that all the actresses I love have in common is that they have diversity in their careers.","I'm now convinced that I'm a doctor. I mean, if someone says they have a pain, I'm like, 'Well, that's your spleen.'","When you're a working actor and you're happy to be one, you can't focus all your energy on acting because you will go crazy. You have to focus as much energy as you can away from yourself.","I was a tomboy and I didn't have a bunch of brothers but I always wanted them and so I sort of adopted a few of my great friends to be my brother.","Inspiration is the key to everything.","I'm a natural blonde, but I feel like a brunette.","I grew up being told by my parents each time they went off to war that they may explode, so I needed to know how things like the gadgets in the kitchen worked.","My parents said marrying was an optimistic thing to do in pessimistic times.","All actors should experience public failure.","I used to play hooky from school so I could watch cooking shows.","It would be so depressing to be a model and not get to say a word. There's no personality involved.","I wanted to be on 'Saturday Night Live' since I was ten.","When I first did theatre, I was always doing comedies; it was always my first love. But it wasn't what I was picked for at first, for films and TV.","Weakness is something we don't like to admit we have. We hold it against people, until we experience it, and then we feel more compassion for it.","What happens so often as an actor is that you retain the information about the scenes that you yourself shot and you obsess over certain scenes that you found the most challenging or interesting. The rest of the film kind of falls away in your memory or it fades a little bit.","It's really kind of a luxury for an actor to have the opportunity to show such different types of characters. I actually left 'Cowboys & Aliens' and went straight into 'The Change-Up.' It was kind of a funny change of pace.","I shaved the back of my head once and did the asymmetrical hair.","I guess for my skin, I clean it and moisturize and try to drink water. How boring is this though? I'm convinced that it comes from within. If you're happy and healthy, it shows.","When I have really blonde hair, I usually go for a more natural look, wearing way less makeup.","I love eye makeup. I really like doing a cat eye, playing with liquid liners and different colors of liners, like emerald and deep blues, combining them with black.","I consider my education to be the first 10 years of my career.","In human years I am 29. In actress years I'm the ripe, promising age of 18 to 35. That's how it works here in Hollyweird.","People assume actresses are afraid to get older; the truth is the roles get a whole lot more compelling once you're too old to play dumb.","I love kids with a passion I usually reserve for hot cheese, miniature chairs, and Prince concerts, but I feel no stress to reproduce simply because of a fear of withering eggs.","In a relationship I'm a very loving person, emotional and sensitive.","In my work in Haiti, I've seen the hugely positive effects that happen when people come together to build something in the middle of the most desperate situations.","In 2012, I see the potential for people to come together, huge moments of political and social engagement where elections are part of the strategy for change, but not the end goal and not the only thing that matters.","People think that young people don't care about things, but I think they do care; they just aren't super interested in conforming to what older people think are the right way to do things.","I use the PhotoReady Foundation almost every day, and their lip glosses are fantastic.","Believe it or not, I'm a big fan of patchouli oil. I know it's not a universally liked fragrance. I usually combine it with other essential oils - I have many mixtures I like.","I do not tweeze my eyebrows. I've been letting them grow out for years. I try to fill them in wherever nature has abandoned me.","I love yoga and hiking - I think that's the perfect combo.","If I could play drums like Patrick Carney or Taylor Hawkins, I'd be a really happy person.","I'm still a student of fashion, but I like hooking up with the people that really know how to make cool clothes.","It was helpful to have the confidence of youth that came from a lack of desperation. I thought, 'If I don't succeed, I'll go back to school and study.'","I trust work, directors - I don't live in fear. All good experiences have come from trusting the universe. There is no other way to live or love. Otherwise, you create your own prison.","When I kiss a girl for a part, people think it's sexy. But if two guys kiss, suddenly there's a backlash. It's a double standard.","I don't own a scale, and Tao banned the word 'fat' from our house. If we eat too much, we say, 'I feel clogged up.'","As you get older, you start to really ask questions like, 'Is this the road I should be walking down?,' because every decision seems more final, as you get older.","A good litmus test is that you should be comfortable with your significant other being present when you hang out with your friend.","I have a great pack of female friends, but I also have a lot of guy friends. I believe that platonic relationship is entirely possible.","I am a big music nerd.","Seeing the energy of 'SNL' made me want to be a part of it. If that was a job, I thought, that was the job I wanted. That was my plan. Comedy.","I actually think the subject of young divorce is pretty funny; I'd like to write a movie about it.","You're going to change as you grow older, and that messes up a lot of relationships.","Not everything has to be a couples' event.","If a woman feels anchored to a man's plans, she may start to resent him for the fun she's worried she's missing.","When you a darker brunette and have pale skin like I do, it can wash you out a bit, so learning to contour is really helpful. I think you can be a bit more bold with eye makeup to define your eyes, and the same with lip colors - you can go for dark wine colors, which I love.","I tend to go with a daytime look, pretty natural, but I always fill in my eyebrows - I hate if I leave the gym and my eyebrows aren't done; I'm just very uncomfortable with myself.","At one point I thought changing my name might help with privacy, but that was before the Internet.","Power tends to get confused with repression.","You really just have to love the process. I can't tell you the amount of film sets I've been on where people are talking about Oscars in the middle of the production. It happens all the time.","I enjoy getting gussied up for an event or date night.","I feel like fashion should not happen in the morning.","I've always been a fan of science fiction. My family, we all used to watch 'Star Trek' together, which is kind of a nerdy family activity.","I feel like the luckiest person on the planet. 'Tron' was such a departure for me.","I've always been a fan of science fiction.","I've thought for a long time that my body type would have worked well in the '70s. The idea that you could be a broad-shouldered, small-breasted woman and still wear really great outfits.","Fear of carbs, of gluten, of everything - we've distanced ourselves from the beauty of food, the art of it. It makes me sad when people say, 'Oh, I don't eat gluten. I don't eat cheese. I don't eat this. So I eat cardboard.'","Many casting directors won't hire aspiring actors because you might be burning some chick's headshot under the table so she doesn't get the part.","People have nervous tics they don't know about, and I would advise asking around. Ask the casting director, 'Is there something I'm doing?' I would see people unconsciously rocking back and forth. I roll my lips. I bite my lips and roll them.","Mick Jagger has been an idol of mine since I was 10 years old. Through his music, he has taught me so much about rock n' roll, but also about the blues and about the experience of live music, going to several Rolling Stones shows, growing up.","Mick Jagger has produced some great films and brought us stories about the music industry that have changed the way we think about how music is made. I never thought I would actually call him my boss, let alone meet Mick Jagger or have any reason to say my name in the same sentence as his.","I think my confidence has developed over the years in terms of the speed at which I will reveal how collaborative I want to be.","When I was 28, I made this film called 'Drinking Buddies' that I starred in and produced, and we improvised the entire thing, and it was a complete exercise in freedom of expression in making something for only the purpose of making it, not for recognition or money or anything else, and it's still my favorite thing I've ever done.","I got a divorce, and I felt like I finally started my career. I started making movies and projects that I just really believed in.","I'm proud to have played characters who've inspired people to live out loud, and I'm lucky to have reached an audience that's been incredibly enthusiastic and supportive.","My parents were journalists and friends with writers, artists, and just a really interesting assortment of people, so I was exposed to all lifestyles from a young age.","It never occurred to me that some people were seen as wrong or even different.","It's not actually OK to just be apathetic about anything.","You realize when you're pregnant how lucky you are to have access to medical care.","I read so many things because a colleague or a friend will post something, and I'll be able to learn a tremendous amount only because they drew attention to it. So I try to do that for others, and that's the great thing about social media. It's not always a narcissistic cesspool or waste of time.","This business is based on numbers, and the numbers show that it's worth investing in female-driven and female-directed films.","There are so many young women in film school right now, and it's just about foreign sales companies, domestic sales companies agreeing to finance films directed by and starring women."],"Olivia Williams":["My skin may have wrinkles but it's because I'm smiling so much. That might sound like some terrible American greetings card, but I feel it's immoral for me to castigate my body for getting older, when it does everything I ask of it.","My parents' long and happy marriage was a great ideal to live up to, but a tough one.","When the Hollywood thing happened, I thought at some point I'd get to the front of the queue: 'Yes, hello, I'd like to play that role.' But you don't. You just join a different queue.","I don't feel under pressure to work because I love what I do and I wanted to do the projects that came my way.","How lucky am I?","My parents have always been cool. They even became surrogates to friends of mine who didn't have such supportive parents.","My parents taught me everything and set me up for life. I owe to them all the things I'm passionate about: music, art, the people I love, my career and family life, the fact that I have children and the way that I raise them.","My father was king of the guidebooks and our holidays were always planned, taking us from a great gallery to an ace cafe to a beautiful view. And as an actor, I loathe improvisation because there's no structure and no one knows what's going on.","The best Christmas present I got from my husband was a week to do whatever I wanted.","I couldn't get any of the ingenue roles when younger because at 5 feet 9 inches with a deep voice I was always too... genue. My career has completely happened since I was 29.","I have many debates now with friends on the changes, and the continuing confusion over bringing up your children, instilling values, letting them make the right choices.","I've been lucky enough to kiss three James Bonds on screen: Pierce Brosnan, George Lazenby and Daniel Craig.","My husband Rhashan reminds me of my father because he's got great strength of character.","I'm a mixture of Anglo-Saxon, a bit of Spanish and one-eighth American. I've often wondered if I have an Asiatic ancestor from the East as well because I have deep-set eyes. Make-up artists are constantly trying to shade my eyelids, and I have to point out that I don't have any!","I wanted to play a TV detective because it's a rite of passage; I wanted to experience every area of acting. I haven't done comedy or as much Shakespeare as I had intended.","From a very young age, I wanted to get up on stage whenever I went to the theatre - the actors just seemed to be having so much fun. One of my worries about theatre, in fact, is that the actors are quite often having more fun than the audience.","Family holidays and weekends are really brightly colored memories, full of my mother and father, rather than our nannies and au pairs.","There's this absurd situation on a movie set where your trailer's here and the set is here and the lunch tent is here, and you're not allowed to get yourself from these three places.","The way I miss my daughter Esme is to worry about her. It is not a pleasurable longing. It contorts my body and scrambles my brain, makes me stop breathing, clench my jaw and my fists, it makes me frown, and makes me blind and deaf, in fact entirely without sensory perception.","I didn't know box office was a thing you could possess but I don't have it. I go up for lovely roles and people with this nebulous thing called box office get them so there isn't much I can do about that unless you know where I can get some box-office myself!"],"Olivia d'Abo":["With thrillers, there's such a fine line between what's good and what's cheesy and corny.","Doing Broadway was always a dream of mine since I was a little girl.","I've always wanted to play 'Lady Macbeth' and Strindberg's 'Miss Julie'.","I've been writing and composing songs since I was 5 years old.","I think one's history and past is important at a certain time in your life, especially as an artist, just to try to hone in on that.","You want to find out what it is about you or what it is about your past and your lineage that's in you now, and whether you carry those traits and maybe what one's mission is to take it to the next level.","I like roles of people who can overcome things because there's strength in that and an arc - and roles where they start in one place, and toward the end of the script they end up in a completely different place, so you've seen this growth and some humanity in the role.","Music has always been a huge passion in my life. I've just had such success with my acting that it's really been right alongside of it, and I've always been writing and playing and singing."],"Olivier Dahan":["I started to think of Grace of Monaco as a metaphor for women in general.","Cannes is a sort of gladiators' arena, and that's the fun part of it. When you accept to come here to open the festival, you know you are going to be criticised. I have no problem with the fact that I expose myself and the movie, and it's normal that I can disagree with the way some people feel.","I don't like the actors to work together beforehand. I trust my intuition, and I like when the actors are the same.","I don't read the critics.","The difficulty with telling stories about real people is you have to find a way of mixing yourself into the matter."],"Olivier Martinez":["And what's more I've got no need for anyone to tell me how to do it. I am not interested. You act how you want to and leave me alone to do my own thing.","Before, I was so stupid. But, you know, when you have friends who died on the street, you say, okay, let's calm down. It's not the kind of energy I want to have in life. I want to go slower, and longer.","I quit after a bad car accident. The thing about boxing is that you can be a star for five or six years, but when you go back to the old life, it's tough.","I'm not a movie star like other actors in the way that I need to walk with a bodyguard.","My father was champion of North Africa and he beat the European champ. He was very good, a professional for 12 years. We're from a big family of boxers. My father has seven brothers.","If you compare me to an actor, I'm probably one of the best boxers in the profession. But if you compare me as a boxer, I'm probably one of the best actors.","Also, I have found that I really like to work in English. It's very strange because it's exactly the opposite of what I thought it would be like.","I don't feel restricted by the language: I feel more free.","I was born and raised in a suburb of Paris by a working-class family.","I wanted to become a champ - I was surrounded by champs in my family and in my neighborhood - and because of this stupid accident, I lost my opportunity.","It's like all the signs were telling me that I shouldn't be a boxer, so I quit.","I played a scene at the end of my first year, and that's how I was discovered.","The first time Adrian saw me was on tape. But you should know that this never works - never in the history of movies has someone been cast from a video.","But when you work with the director and the real person who is playing opposite you, it changes everything. You are almost in a working session. I was very comfortable, and that's maybe what helped me to get the part.","But what I really like are old Hollywood movies. Very often I watch AMC.","I really believe great actors, even with disease and age, can be great.","And I think it is the genius of actors to be able to escape whatever people are expecting of them. Otherwise you become like a factory worker.","People sometimes recognize me here, but they are very nice.","Otherwise, to be a movie star, it's a lot of compromise and also a lot of headaches. You can't do what you want. You become a prisoner of your fame. This happened to me in France and I don't want it.","I see my friends, my family, my cousins work all day long for very little money, and if I have this problem of not being able to wall on the streets, it's not a big deal.","I always say I was born too late in the world, too old.","Love is based on imagination.","I'll always be a foreigner.","It's nice to have some distance with your family. As long as you're closer to them by love.","Who knows what happens tomorrow? We'll find it tomorrow.","Imagination creates some big monsters.","I like Brad Pitt; I just have nothing to do with him.","If you want to be happy, live discreetly. Does that make sense in English?","I never analyze why I was with one woman instead of another.","It's not only imagination, it's the distortion of the vision. You suddenly think, This person is idealistic, this person is strong, this person has dreams, when you know better most of the time. You put what you want to see on people.","I don't want to dig in the truth all of the time. Let me dream.","I don't have goals in life.","I want just to be happy and peaceful. And that's not always the case when you're married.","The big difference with Juliette and the others in that film is that she goes beyond acting.","Every morning, I can lose myself just by looking at my son.","Sometimes you have to laugh about what gets published; sometimes it's annoying, but in general I don't care.","Just being famous feels cheap to me.","In Hollywood, you can live alongside very famous but still incredibly boring people. I've never wanted to be immortal. Even if nobody remembers me after my death, it's still okay with me.","The longer you stand with people, the better it becomes.","There are two smells that I can recognize right away. The smell of the boxing ring and the smell of a garage. That's where I grew up. I can recognize these places with my eyes closed.","My son will be an American, but I remain French.","I'm French - it's less important. Meaning, I remain a Frenchman in America, but I adapt to American culture. I feel good there - but I'm still a foreigner."],"Olivier Megaton":["The most difficult thing to do is drama.","Action movies today are going to so fast, you can't say you're going to do everything faster and faster.","I'm not a fan of action movies.","I'm a painter. I was a graffiti artist, and I painted all over the world.","I never wanted to be a director. I came into this industry by the little door, so I never learned anything; I never went to school. Actors will tell you I'm very precise. I just have the intuition of doing things.","People who watch 'Transporter' are maybe asking a little less about reality, being serious, and so on.","I like thrillers. My style of movies are closer to thrillers.","I like David Lynch; I like Stanley Kubrick. I'm a big fan of Kubrick.","To be on the set with the actors, with the location, every day changes; every day something can go wrong.","When you make a movie, you really have to be clever and smart, find something new for the worldwide audience because you aren't making a movie for just France or Germany; it's for everyone in the world.","Especially on 'Taken,' 'Taken' was not a big success the day of its release. It was released in France first, and it didn't do bad, but not as good as it did in the U.S.","I like to discover new things.","When you write a script, you always think about what your heart is asking.","'Taken' is a really difficult project because it was a big surprise for everybody."],"Olivier Messiaen":["I give bird songs to those who dwell in cities and have never heard them, make rhythms for those who know only military marches or jazz, and paint colors for those who see none.","The human being is flesh and consciousness, body and soul; his heart is an abyss which can only be filled by that which is godly.","No one should be allowed to make music as if he were made of wood. One must reproduce the musical text exactly, but not play like a stone.","My faith is the grand drama of my life. I'm a believer, so I sing words of God to those who have no faith."],"Olivier Sarkozy":["Solving a problem created by debt... by creating more debt is a fool's errand."],"Olivier Theyskens":["Our eyes reflect light. Better that the lips are more like a rose petal.","I like to be lazy. I do like to be busy and really active, but when that's done, you can be sure I will be a lazy boy. I like to take time and relax and enjoy life.","We always see the point of an iceberg. So I've always accepted the idea that people - they don't necessarily know everything I am.","What is sure is that the satellite view of our world and its evolution is now a common reality.","A black dress is beautiful! It's a good choice. It could be the wrong choice at certain events or situations, but it's very rare that you see a girl who looks bad in a black dress.","People who don't know me sometimes call me 'Mademoiselle.'","Today there are more things you can wear for the same occasions. I still like this idea of the perfect suit, and I always love tailoring, but today you can have more things for this type of situation, clothes that have class and that are mixable, and that are super well cut.","I think the relationship is very tenuous between fashion and art. Many designers have built relationships with artists, which is not something I personally did. But it's true, sometimes you see artists working for a designer or a brand on some specific project or taking care of their environment and making an amazing store.","When other boys dreamt of going to the moon or becoming doctors, I wanted to be a designer.","I feel super lucky to be living in New York. I love the city, I love the energy. I always loved it. I had pictures of New York in my bedroom when I was young.","Personally, I am not so affected by my environment. What I build in the creative process is not necessarily connected to what I am physically in contact with. I am always observing everything, but it will not necessarily have a direct impact on what I do.","The only shoes that look futuristic are Crocs, but they would be terrible to use in a futuristic movie.","I'm kind of obsessed with cool girls.","In fashion, we don't often know the prices. We don't have time to go into the stores.","I didn't understand the advantages of staying active until I was about 27.","I've admired historical clothes like Victorian gowns since I was a child, and it's what motivated me to go into fashion.","Personally, I have had sometimes moments where I thought my idea behind the idea of a collection - the concept maybe - something that we don't see at the end on the catwalk, I think the way it was, the genesis in my mind, was probably artistic, an artistic approach.","Art is the way people see things, and I think it's great when individuals can find in fashion something they truly believe is artistic.","For a long time I have been thinking about affordable fashion - you can be disappointed when not so many people can wear your stuff.","With couture, you feel obligated to design something modern each season, but with Theyskens Theory, I don't question anything. I'm thinking of what I'd like to wear.","My sense of designing is a mix of intuition and intellectual control.","I am interested in the idea of 'taste.' And by 'taste,' I mean opinion, inspiration and the craft of creating a personality through fabric and design.","When I was very young, I wanted to be a girl. I was jealous that girls got to be princesses and wear skirts. It tormented me. When I was 6, I even heard that you could change your sex, and I was very intrigued until the moment I realized that if I changed into a girl, I would be an ugly girl, and this is the last thing I wanted to be.","My first collection was made from sheets that my grandmother, who lived in Normandy, had been collecting for a long time. There are a lot of flea markets in that part of France, and she knew what I liked.","I rarely stay at home when I'm in New York. I'm always doing things. It brings you so much energy.","I always like to preserve my freedom. I've never really been attached to any place; that's probably why I kept moving. I like to evolve.","If you are a girl dressing up in the morning thinking about the whole world having a point of view on what you are wearing, it takes the pleasure out of getting dressed.","I could live naked... I love it.","When I was young, watching historical movies made me feel absolutely sublime. But the first few times I visited costume museums, I was really disappointed because it was not at the level I saw in movies. It was not the level of the image I'd imagined.","Historical costumes from the 18th and 19th centuries look so complicated, but when you see the patterns, it's very systematic. I've always been impressed by how the patterns economize the fabric.","The aim of being a good designer is to have an influence. If you design furniture or lifestyle, you should influence the way people evolve globally. It's good to have an influence.","What is funny is when you do a futuristic movie, you immediately get to be fashionable because you're creating something that doesn't exist.","It's interesting for me because in my work, a lot of times, I like to scrutinize the clothes and think what's going to make them look dated, and I do the same with vintage. In vintage, you want something unique and different, but at the same time, something that doesn't make you look like you dress like a grandpa.","I am not a designer that buys vintage to be inspired.","As a designer, I'm not a guy that can be put in a niche.","Even during the golden age of fashion, you had haute couture houses where the designers didn't have money.","I don't think couture will die. But it should have no pretension that it will conquer the world. It's not something that will disappear because all you need is a thread and a needle to start making something couture.","I see the city as an organism, shaped through time by the little humans having habits and doing millions of stuff in and out of it.","When Princess Diana got married, I was a very little kid, I think. I remember her dress, and I found the dress amazing when I was a kid.","I haven't made many wedding dresses. It's a dress very, very important for the girl; it's important to know the person, I believe, but at the same time it should be a shock to the person - the person should be shocked to be suddenly revealed. That's the work of a designer sometimes, to propose an ID of look.","Personality is so important - when you dress somebody for a big party, it is good to feel that the person has an ease and naturalness with what she is wearing.","When I started at Ricci, I did street wear for very cool, young girls, but the price point was for the fourth floor of Bergdorf Goodman next to Carolina Herrera. My cool girls cannot afford it.","My mother loved fashion and always had a great aesthetic. But she also considered the cost of it, with the kids, that it wasn't something to allow herself.","I really hated school. I had the feeling I was losing a lot of time."],"Olly Murs":["I love single life! Why would it be boring? I mean, I get to travel around and have loads of girls screaming at me, so it's definitely not boring. However, it can get lonely on the road, but I'm sorted I've got good people around me.","You've always got to have the right blend of colour. You'd be silly to match a yellow t-shirt with a light green pair of trousers, you know? You can wear different colours at the same time, and as long as they blend with each other then it works. That's what I like.","I know I'm really lucky to do what I do, but sometimes with the hours and the travelling, I don't get to see my family and friends as much as I'd like. It can be lonely on the road. Sometimes I come offstage after a massive adrenaline rush, and then when I go to an empty hotel room on my own, it can be an anti-climax.","You should only have so many accessories. You have to make sure you have the right ones at the right time.","I said if I have a No. 1, I'll do a naked photo shoot! I'm not sure a lot of people would like to see that, but it was more to the fans, really. Every gig I do, they try to get me to take my clothes off, so it's a promise to them - if I get a No. 1, I'll happily do a naked shoot.","Whenever you write music, you want it to touch people on a certain level. I mean, I've been reading tweets about 'Troublemaker' and people saying 'OMG, I can so relate to this - this is a guy that I fancy, or a girl that I fancy; it's exactly like this person.'","I lost 'The X Factor,' and I lost 'Deal or No Deal' twice. I'm good at losing game shows.","When I was 23, I went backpacking around Australia for three months. I saved up a few grand, quit my job and flew to Sydney, then went to Melbourne and up the East Coast, which was an incredible experience. I remember running out of money and getting my mum to send me a few hundred quid, which helped me get by.","I take my mobile phone and iPad wherever I go. I like to switch off when I'm on holiday, but I always check emails in case someone at home is trying to get hold of me.","I think we all attract troublemakers; I don't think it's particularly about anyone. I had it actually as an album title, and I thought it would be really cool to write a song about a girl that's a bit of troublemaker.","I'm a straight guy and I date women, but I get on really well with gay guys. I'm very comfortable with my sexuality. The weirdest thing for me is when straight guys get really freaked out by gay guys. It's almost like they're insecure in their own sexuality. For me, I can be in a room full of gay men and have fun.","Whenever you're in a relationship, you have that favorite song that reminds you of when you first got together or when you first kissed, and then every time you hear that song, it reminds you of that person.","I'm really into personalities. There have been certain girls that I've been attracted to, but when we got to chatting, it was such a let-down. So for me, a great personality is key.","I like girls who want to get up and dance and don't mind singing in front of my family - you know, silly stuff. Some girls won't eat in front of boys or won't go bowling. They just want to go out and look pretty. I don't really get that. I want someone who is up for having a good time.","The first bit of vinyl I bought was Michael Jackson's 'Bad.'","I suppose I've got a natural rhythm. When I was little, I used to just dance a lot and have some fun. I'd never been taught to dance. I've never been to dance school. I do my own little dance moves.","I was living at home until about 27 and decided it was time to move out and move somewhere else, so that's what I did. I wanted it to be the right thing to do. I didn't want to buy something out of my price range; I didn't want to be stupid with my money, so I decided to stay at home. Luckily, my mum and dad were amazing.","I'm a big soccer fan, so any soccer player that I meet, I always get star struck. I've met a lot of big stars - Justin Timberlake, Michael Buble - and I don't ever get starstruck, but when I met famous ex-football players, I just got completely starstruck.","To be the most successful male from 'The X Factor' is a big achievement, and I'm chuffed with that.","I always wanted to be in a boy band since I was a kid.","It has been hard for me in a sense because from an industry point of view - I don't care if I'm from the 'X Factor;' I embrace the fact that I'm from the 'X Factor,' but other people don't embrace that.","I know that there are going to be people that don't like my music, but I think in the industry itself it is always that, 'Oh. you're from the 'X Factor.' There have been certain radio stations that will not play your song because you are from the 'X Factor,' yet they'll play another song from an artist from another TV show.","You look at what One Direction has done and just say, 'That is just lucky;' it is not. It is happening because they are talented boys, good looking lads; and yes, their songs might not be the typical songs that lots of radios want to play, but they are great songs, pop records, that are massive across the world selling in huge numbers.","I'm involved in music and fashion a lot more than I used to be, so my style has definitely changed - for the better, of course. It's given me greater insight into what colours work, what looks good on camera, and what I feel comfortable in.","Since becoming a pop star, I've experimented a lot more. I've gotten more creative with what I wear. My stylist is a bit more adventurous than I would normally be, but it's really worked, and the colours really work together. I think everyone should be a bit more confident: if it's a summer's day, wear some bright colours.","I don't think Flo Rida gets on just any song. If you look at the songs he has done - even The Saturdays one - was a hit. If it's not good enough, then he won't do it.","It's such a hard thing to write a song for your fans without sounding naff and thanking them for spending money on you.","New Year's Eve was always a big occasion at home with the family. Every year we would get the karaoke machine out and I'd entertain everyone, even as a young kid.","I wouldn't like my fans going through my rubbish.","I've always felt that my life's been at the right place at the right time; I feel like there's been some really dull moments, really high moments, really low moments, but it's always felt like everything's moved in the right direction; it always feels great, and everything feels right.","Like every artist that comes out, you want to make a mark; you want to be a household name and you want to be someone that people are going to look back in ten years/fifteen years' time and go, 'I love this guy Olly Murs. He was brilliant back in the day; he was someone I really, really liked.'","Epic were adamant that I should carry on being me. They liked the way I look, my clothes, hats... nothing's changed really.","Trevor Horn has worked with some of the biggest stars there is. And he was happy to do a record with me. He's worked with some amazing people, and then there's little old me walking in.","I find it frustrating when people wear belts with braces. That's an interesting one.","I don't really do sad, depressing songs.","I'd love to meet the right girl and have a family. I'm very broody.","I'm a bit of a perfectionist. I'll watch myself back on 'Xtra Factor' and want to do it again because of a few hiccups.","I want to be in a stable relationship and have kids by the time I'm 30.","I'm a huge fan of 'Heart On My Sleeve' - I think it has a 'Take That' feel to it! John Shanks and James Morrison wrote the track, and we spoke to Sony and asked if we could reference a 'Greatest Day'/'Rule The World' sound to make that epic ballad. I think it does the job.","If people are paying money to see me, then I want them to walk away from the show knowing they had a really great time. I want it to be very energetic and to have fun, sad, emotional and uplifting moments. I want it to have everything!","I'm just an instant flirt with most people. I'm very cheeky.","I think when you're a TV presenter, you have to have a reason for doing it, and a lot of them have been around a long time and grafted for that. The reason why it works with me on 'The Xtra Factor' is because I was a contestant on it, and I have a relationship with the viewers at home.","I'm trying to bring back 'Top of the Pops.' I don't know why us artists haven't just stood there and said, 'Let's back a campaign and bring it back,' because it would be the most amazing thing ever. 'X Factor' has got the Sunday show, and except for 'Later with Jools Holland,' which is a massive success, there isn't one music show.","When you come off 'The X Factor,' you're more likely to be a failure than a success because people almost want you to fail. There's this kind of feeling that you're separate from everyone else. You get it from artists, people in the industry, people at record labels.","My granddad was a hard worker, and my dad is, too. It was instilled in me as a kid. I never got pocket money; I had to earn it. I had two paper rounds before school, not just one. Wherever I worked, whether it was at football, in the pub, I'd do whatever was asked of me - and more.","My original aim after 'The X Factor' was to earn enough money in a year to make the whole experience worth it - you know, buy a car, a flat.","I didn't even know I could sing or write songs. I didn't have that education. But people shouldn't think they can look down on someone like me, because I've had the same success as others, sold the same amount of records, if not more. They shouldn't think that because I'm just from 'The X Factor,' I'm not credible or respected as much.","I think I've done everything on 'The X Factor' apart from the cleaning.","I'm a big fan of Justin Timberlake and Bruno Mars - that's my next level. You've got to dream. People have always tried to shoot me down for wanting to be a big worldwide star. But why not? You have to broaden your horizons and put yourself out there.","I'm not going to do a song that's really sad and thoughtful. Although I've done ballads like 'Dear Darlin',' I want to make them dance and be happy.","Whenever I've been in Scotland I've had such amazing support, and the love from Scottish fans has always been great.","It would have been easy for me to bring out a real cheesy pop song, but 'Please Don't Let Me Go' isn't your typical 'X Factor' single, and it's a grower, not a shower.","Like a lot of young lads who dreamt about being a singer, I was a massive fan of Robbie Williams and couldn't believe my luck when, not only did I get to meet my idol, but sing with him, too.","I've only really had one period when I lost myself and felt like I was going to lose my career, and that was when I first began presenting 'X-Factor' spin-off 'The Xtra Factor' two years ago. I was worried if I did a rubbish job live on Saturday night TV that my music career was going to get affected and I would lose everything.","There's always going to be someone out there who doesn't like what you do, doesn't like your style, your face. That's part of life. But I feed off that. I don't think I'd be where I am today if it wasn't for that. It puts a little fire in the belly, keeps me going so I can prove so many people wrong.","In the U.K., I came from a talent show. I was watched by millions of people, so instantly when I came out from the show, people knew who I was.","It felt when I was growing up that sport was, like, the only thing you should do... if you do music, you're really different and a bit weird.","After 'Heart Skips A Beat' hit No.1, I barely had a chance to celebrate 'cos it was straight over to the judges' houses for the 'Xtra Factor,' filming in Greece, L.A. and Spain.","I'm a keen runner, so I try to fit in a half hour every other day.","Being a typical Briton, I love my home comforts and always try and find an English pub where I can tuck into some traditional English food, accompanied by a nice pint. Fortunately, I haven't been ill with food poisoning or anything like that, which is quite surprising considering how many different types of food I eat when I'm travelling.","I am fortunate to stay at lots of lovely hotels when I'm on tour, but my favourite hotel group in Britain is Malmaison. I recently stayed at the Malmaison in Manchester, which was pretty amazing. It had a fabulous bar and restaurants, as well as fantastic rooms with mood lighting.","My sleep is very important, and I have to have at least eight hours every night in order to function properly the next day. Unfortunately, flying through several time zones makes me disorientated, and it takes several days to readjust.","People relate to me, and I try to make songs that make people smile.","I'm not really one for reading books. I have a very poor attention span. I'd rather listen to music, play games or watch films on my iPad.","I've established myself as a proper artist. And it's ridiculous when anyone questions my credibility - I've had four number one singles and I've also sold over two and a half million albums. I shouldn't have to convince people that I'm credible, but I'm glad people are now taking me more seriously."],"Olof Palme":["For us democracy is a question of human dignity. And human dignity is political freedom.","The rights of democracy are not reserved for a select group within society, they are the rights of all the people."],"Olusegun Obasanjo":["We regard America and Europe as old friends. We keep old friends, but we make new friends in Japan, India, and China.","Let me make a solemn pledge before all of you, before the whole world and before God, that I will devote all my energy and all I possess in my power to serve the people of Nigeria and humanity.","Corruption, the greatest single bane of our society today.","My gut feelings and my faith tell me that until God shuts a door, no human can shut it.","Unfortunately, the true force which propels our endless political disputes, our constant struggles for political advantage, is often not our burning concern for democracy, it is often of our dedication to the principle of the rule of law.","I am a black man inside and outside and you are white men on the outside, but inside, you are Africans like me.","I believe God knew what he was doing when he put oil under our ground. It should be a means to an end.","Nigeria has no business with poverty. With our human and material resources, we shall strive to eradicate poverty from our country.","I want to take this opportunity to acknowledge that our foreign friends are welcome to join in our endeavor to develop the resources of our country.","I will not say the fact that there are no European Union observers at an election means that it will not be fair and free.","My joy knows no bounds... I will devote all my energy and all the powers available to me to the service of Nigeria and humanity.","Pope John Paul II not only visited Nigeria twice but stood by the country in its fight against dictatorship and injustice.","We will as soon as possible reexamine our laws and policies and eliminate all obstacles to genuine investment.","We will work to bring an element of stability to the price of oil.","What the oil producer gets paid is about 16 percent. The majority of it is tax, which in fairness to the government of this country they have accepted and admitted.","If I am not above the law, nobody in this country can then claim to be above the law.","There is no part of the world where corruption is absolutely eliminated.","Fighting corruption is not a one-night affair.","The givers of most of the corruption in Africa are from outside Africa.","When I left office in 1979, I was about the only one who had really left public office on my own."],"Olympia Brown":["The grandest thing has been the lifting up of the gates and the opening of the doors to the women of America, giving liberty to twenty-seven million women, thus opening to them a new and larger life and a higher ideal.","Fortuitous circumstances constitute the moulds that shape the majority of human lives, and the hasty impress of an accident is too often regarded as the relentless decree of all ordaining fate.","The more we learn of science, the more we see that its wonderful mysteries are all explained by a few simple laws so connected together and so dependent upon each other, that we see the same mind animating them all.","How natural that the errors of the ancient should be handed down and, mixing with the principles and system which Christ taught, give to us an adulterated Christianity.","He who never sacrificed a present to a future good or a personal to a general one can speak of happiness only as the blind do of colors."],"Olympia Dukakis":["I think it's because most of us talk one way and live another. There are a few people who truly, truly walk the talk.","When I was a kid, I'd kneel down at the side of my bed every night before I went to sleep, and my mother and I would say a Greek prayer to the Virgin Mary.","So I constantly play women who are damaged and out of touch, who are seeking without knowing, or knowing without the skills to transform their lives. But then, that's really the fate of many women today.","You don't stay married for thirty-nine years because of sex or even because of love, but because your partner is a real friend to you, because they respect and regard you.","Winning is everything in Hollywood.","When my children were born, I didn't have them baptized because I felt baptism was about erasing Original Sin - something the Church said children got from their mother - and I absolutely refused to believe women carry Original Sin.","The rest of us are still trying to find ways to live in the world with spirit-ual values. Myself included. We've learned certain skills, we've learned to prevail somewhat, but we've not made it over the mountain.","Thankfully, it became clear to me that when I compete, I lose my connection to the passion I have for my work.","Stories about the ongoing dramas in our lives as we age are not being told because women find it difficult to be honest about what's going on - about, for example, our heightened sexuality as we age or about living in a society that only values youth.","Sometimes I feel as if four thousand years of silencing women, of the fear of women who were burned in oil or eviscerated in front of their daughters, is imprinted deep within me and has altered my DNA.","My husband is a fall-away Catholic, but with a vengeance. He's actually more of a feminist than I am.","Most of us are not real eager to grow, myself included. We try to be happy by staying in the status quo. But if we're not willing to be honest with ourselves about what we feel, we don't evolve.","I think we're socialized out of being women, and then we have to find our way back to it. That's hard to do.","I think we have to be careful about what we label as a prerequisite for spirituality. I don't think you have to know a lot to have a spiritual life, but knowing gives life richness.","I talk to women's groups all over the country and see women struggling with this. The fear of not being accepted, of being different, of not having a man, all make it hard for a woman to do what she really believes is right for her.","I sometimes truly despair at ever being meaningfully altered and affected by the things I claim are so important to me.","I feel it most in my work, because there aren't roles about women who are spiritually evolving. That anyone would even write something like that, something that's worth doing, would be a miracle!","God is not something I think about but something I experience as an energy, a Presence. I do find it easier to pray to a female Presence or an androgynous Presence."],"Olympia Snowe":["I understand why so many Americans are fed up with government. The 112th Congress was almost universally derided as the worst ever. It was the most polarized body since the end of Reconstruction, according to one study, and I grew embarrassed by its partisan bickering, inactivity, and refusal to address the vital challenges facing America.","What motivated me to dedicate myself to public service for nearly two-thirds of my life was the chance to produce results for those people who entrusted me to be their voice and their champion.","Unfortunately, money in politics is an insidious thing - and a loophole in our campaign finance system was taken advantage of with money going to existing or new 527 groups with the sole purpose of influencing the election.","You can never solve a problem without talking to people with whom you disagree. The United States Senate is predicated and based on consensus building. That was certainly the vision of the founding fathers.","What is the purpose of public service? It's to solve problems for the people you represent and certainly in the United States Senate, thinking about your state and thinking about your country as well.","I've never backed down from a fight and I relish a good debate.","We recognized in 1996 that, with progress in the field of genetics accelerating at a breathtaking pace, we need to ensure that advances in treatment and prevention of disease do not constitute a new basis for discrimination.","One difficulty in making the Senate work the way it was intended is that America's electorate is increasingly divided into red and blue states, with lawmakers representing just one color or the other.","In a politically diverse nation, only by finding that common ground can we achieve results for the common good.","At an unprecedented time with the worst attack ever on our soil, our President displayed extraordinary determination, leadership and resolve when history was thrust upon him and the United States.","In today's world, it is no longer unimaginable to think that business can operate - and even thrive - in an environmentally-friendly manner.","Most breast cancer-related deaths can be prevented through simple and painless preventive measures. A late diagnosis can result in more serious, long-term consequences.","It is time that we provide clarity for our seniors, informing them of the services available that will lower the costs of their prescription drugs and strengthen the overall integrity of the Medicare entitlement.","Indeed, we must foster cost-saving competition. And that means joining the marketplace of other industrialized countries - not just for the manufacturers who sell drugs, but for consumers as well.","Hopefully, 21 years later, Judge Roberts possesses an openness with respect to issues of gender-based wage discrimination.","When my first husband died, what I tried to do is to sort of, you know, try to bring some rationale to the circumstance and think about worse circumstances, and also open the door to what other women experienced when all of a sudden they were left alone. And particularly if they had children.","The United States Senate wasn't designed to be a majority-rule institution. It was designed to include and accommodate the rights of the minority in small states as well as large states.","What happens is that, you know, on Mondays, at least in the Senate, you know, Monday night we'd have what you'd call a bed-check vote. Just to get, you know, the machinery of the Senate up and running so they can start the committee process; on Tuesday morning, things go. By Thursday, you know, jet fumes, the smell of jet fumes.","My concept of government's role in people's lives is that it is limited but legitimate, and essential when people have nowhere else to turn.","Two truths are all too often overshadowed in today's political discourse: Public service is a most honorable pursuit, and so is bipartisanship.","I have been immeasurably honored to serve the people of Maine for nearly 40 years in public office and for the past 17 years in the United States Senate. It was incredibly difficult to decide that I would not seek a fourth term in the Senate.","I represent what I think is a traditional Republican... a limited government, fiscal responsibility, strong national defense, individual freedom and liberty.","Joining the Bipartisan Policy Center is a natural extension of my efforts to achieve results throughout my tenure in Congress, and it provides an ideal means for developing strategies that can garner the broad support necessary to achieve real solutions to the challenges confronting our nation.","I have worked for three decades as a staunch advocate of building a 'big tent' party that includes both pro-choice and pro-life Republicans."],"Om Malik":["I like the muted sounds, the shroud of grey, and the silence that comes with fog.","Finding your soul begins by discovering our ability to listen! Alternatively, by sharing a smile, a laugh and just by being human to everyone - from friends, colleagues, family, and especially strangers, including those who are not from the same station in life as you.","There are days when I look at my news feed, and it seems like a social fabric of fun - a video of the first steps of my friends' baby! My nephew's prom date! On other days, it feels like a NASCAR vehicle, plastered with news stories, promoted posts, lame Live videos, and random content.","For me, stories are like Lego blocks. If I don't put one down, I can't put the next one down.","Fog is my weakness, and every time there is low fog, I am out and about with my camera.","Snapchat works because using a selfie is way easier than texting or tweeting. Stories should adapt to the medium and do so without cheapening the story.","Augmented reality is the 'boy who cried wolf' of the post-Internet world - it's long been promised but has rarely been delivered in a satisfying way.","QR codes have always been a kind of half-measure, a useful but inelegant transitional technology; the ultimate goal is augmented reality.","We are splintering what was the 'camera' and its functionality - lens, sensors, and processing - into distinct parts, but, instead of lenses and shutters, software and algorithms are becoming the driving force.","When it comes to the mobile web, the technology industry seems to be split between two camps - native apps and HTML5 web-based apps.","Cameras can look down from on high and predict crop yields, traffic in Walmart parking lots, and travel patterns on Labor Day weekend. On the ground, they form the foundation of autonomous-driving systems.","It is becoming harder for us to stay on top of the onslaught - e-mails, messages, appointments, alerts. Augmented intelligence offers the possibility of winnowing an increasing number of inputs and options in a way that humans can't manage without a helping hand.","Facebook has gone from a nice-and-boring social network to becoming an identity layer of the web. It is where nearly a billion people are depositing the artifacts of civilization in the 21st century - photos, videos, and birthday wishes.","Photography has always been about capturing light.","Porsche's and Apple's design philosophies are similar. Much like the 356, the original iPhone was about defining a foundation for the future.","Sure, we all like listening to music on vinyl, but that doesn't mean streaming music on Spotify is bad.","Apps have become a preferred way of accessing information on mobile devices.","A lot of what people are calling 'artificial intelligence' is really data analytics - in other words, business as usual. If the hype leaves you asking 'What is A.I., really?,' don't worry, you're not alone.","A platform is essentially a business model that thrives because of the participation and value added from third parties with only incremental effort from the owner of the platform.","Everybody's trying to repeat the past with the new network, with new devices and new tools. Why not make something brand-new?","The lightbulb, the most humble and illuminating of all technologies, when combined with a network connection, transforms itself from being a bulb into a wake-up alarm, a mood alteration mechanism, and in some cases, a cupid's assistant.","Unlike Facebook or Instagram, Twitter's core experience isn't about photos. It's a world of text, with occasional embedded photos, animated gifs, and short video clips.","Twitter is short-form, real-time, and text-based. It's built for instant alerts and rapid consumption. It is an ideal system for delivering sips of information from an abundant stream.","Sure, Google's and Apple's ecosystems look a little different, but they are meant to do pretty much the same thing. For the two companies, innovation on mobile essentially means catching up to the other's growing list of features.","Mindfulness is natural when you do not need to think about minor daily problems like making a living!","Why don't we face up to the fact that many of us in Silicon Valley are living lives that involve telling ourselves a lot of lies.","If you look at something like Spotify, many record labels are investors in the company. So from that standpoint, the money is all going back into the labels.","Social sharing of photos - landscapes, selfies, latte-foam art - can spark conversations and deeper engagements.","I don't think I had a role model. I just was very inspired by an article which I read in Forbes magazine around the information superhighway and the Arpanet and stuff like that. To me, that intuitively made sense, and when I decided to come to the U.S., I knew exactly what I wanted to go and write about.","The possibilities that come with thinking about the camera as a portal into the realm of information and services are attractive not only to Snap but also to every other big player in the tech world. Facebook, for instance, has slowly been enhancing the visual capabilities of its Messenger.","The early entrants into the world of A.R., as with its cousin virtual reality, were disappointing: the phones were too weak, the networks were too slow, and the applications were too nerdy. But now the technological pieces are in place, and a whole generation - much of which is on Snapchat - has come to consider the camera almost a third arm.","Just as two people can have similar personalities, two companies can have a remarkably similar approach to business.","Our ubiquitous mobile access has made time and location important data points in how businesses can now be built and managed.","Uber, like Google, is taking a highly disorganized business - in its case, private transportation such as taxicabs and private limousines - and ordering it neatly.","Google came of age when search was inefficient and cluttered, and made it simple and easy to find what you wanted online.","The lens through which I view the media world is pretty simple: If you are in the business of sucking up attention, then you are in the media business.","Its definition can be a bit murky, but to me, native advertising is a sales pitch that fits right into the flow of the information being shown. It doesn't interrupt - native ads don't pop up or dance across the screen - and its content is actually valuable to the person viewing it.","People pay little attention to banner ads - in fact, everyone dislikes them - and that leads to infinitesimally small click-through rates that make marketers unhappy.","In the simplest terms, a fast-growing company can't keep growing at the same fast rate forever. It eventually has to slow down.","Our economy, for a long while, has been transitioning from one reliant on industrial strength to one based on digital information. The next step in this transition is a digital economy shaped by connectivity.","Facebook, Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft are building their own versions of the future. And they get bigger and bigger.","Facebook needs to maintain its vise-like grip on our attention to become a conduit of not only advertising but also commerce, so that it can take a cut of everything.","Ideally, Facebook would take all our clicks and information and would magically give us everything we want, without us even knowing we want it.","I know I am not alone in struggling with Facebook and how we experience it through its news feed.","Computers in general, and software in particular, are much more difficult than other kinds of technology for most people to grok, and they overwhelm us with a sense of mystery.","Before we had the Internet, we would either call or write to our friends, one at a time, and keep up with their lives. It was a slow process and took a lot of effort and time to learn about each other.","For the longest time, computers have been associated with work. Mainframes were for the Army, government agencies, and then large companies. Workstations were for engineers and software programmers. PCs were initially for other white-collar jobs.","Now every person edits the story they tell about themselves, carefully ensuring what the world looks at - whether it's over Instagram, Twitter or Facebook.","Our entire society is rooted around the idea of more, and longer has become the measure of success.","I want fewer interruptions in my day. I have eliminated a lot of things from my life. I'm on a declining scale of wanting things.","I love my paper and ink, but I see the benefits of the iPad and Apple Pencil.","From analog film cameras to digital cameras to iPhone cameras, it has become progressively easier to take and store photographs. Today, we don't even think twice about snapping a shot.","I worry about Google's data ethics and about the idea of handing over the corpus of my life, but I can't deny that it is exceptional at making sense of my ever-growing photo library.","Pokemon Go, which involves trying to 'catch' Pikachu or Squirtle or other creatures with your smartphone, is an inherently social experience. You need to be walking around - on the streets, in public places - to catch the Pokemon.","Business, much like life, is not a movie, and not everyone gets to have a storybook ending.","Apple has always been, and always will be, a hardware-first company. It produces beautiful devices with elegant designs and humane operating-system software.","By now, we all know that our every move online can be tracked and traced, and that, ideally, services learn from and adapt to customers based on an artful deployment of that data.","Because Apple's corporate DNA is that of a hardware company, its activities are meant to support hardware sales.","Compared to Apple, Internet companies like Google and Facebook don't have strong perspectives on the way they want the world to work.","Echoes of the iPhone are everywhere. Xiaomi's phones and Google's new Pixel are designed to fool you into thinking that they just might be an iPhone.","In 1947, Porsche began work on its 356. In many ways, it was like the original iPhone. It wasn't perfect. It was underpowered. But it was streamlined and aerodynamic.","Camera companies, like traditional phone manufacturers, dismissed the iPhone as a toy when it launched in 2007. Nokia thought that the iPhone used inferior technology; the camera makers thought that it took lousy pictures. Neither thought that they had anything to worry about.","In a way, digital cameras were like very early personal computers such as the Commodore 64 - clunky and able to do only a few things.","If you're texting a friend about dinner, Google will give you restaurant reviews and directions automatically.","Apple continues to make ever-thinner devices with a superlative build and a luxurious feel. What the company has achieved beneath the surface is worth even more praise.","The battle between Google and Apple has shifted from devices, operating systems, and apps to a new, amorphous idea called 'contextual computing.' We have become data-spewing factories, and the only way to make sense of it all is through context.","Most competition in Silicon Valley now heads toward there being one monopolistic winner.","Looking back, Google's success came from the fortuitous timing of being born at the cusp of the broadband age. But it also came about because of the new reality of the Internet: a lot of services were going to be algorithmic, and owning your own infrastructure would be a key advantage.","While in the early days of networks, growth was limited by slowness and cost at numerous points - expensive telephone connections, computers that crashed, browsers that didn't work - the rise of the smartphone has essentially changed all that.","The funny thing is that I used to be a blogger, but it wasn't known as 'blogging' at that time. This was in the '99/2000 time frame.","As an online journalist, newswire journalist, newspaper writer, I wrote every day. My whole thing was, 'I have to write and report and write every day.' That was my thing.","Most of the stress we feel here in Silicon Valley is self-inflicted.","Living a 24-hour news life has come at a personal cost. I still wake in middle of the night to check the stream to see if something is breaking, worrying whether I missed some news.","When I look at Kickstarter, I see small businesses that have been funded by their customers. I see the acceleration of this shift away from the industrial manufacturing ideology to more of a maker economy. And I also see an idea so powerful that the company name has become a verb.","When I see Kickstarter, I don't see a company. Instead, I see a social movement. I see people doing things for people.","For a while, I have had this theory that we, as a society, are coming to the end of the mass production, industrial phase of the human race.","I think the emotional appeal of a platform is what works. I think the old-media entities still have not figured out that part of the game plan.","In the touch-based mobile device era, folks need to think of ways to have a single technology stack married to the ability to create unique experiences for different devices.","Having followed the wireless industry long enough, I can tell you that building and supporting an application for different platforms is as tough as climbing a straight wall of rock.","In cities like New York, it is common to find taxicabs with wireless-enabled card readers.","The marriage of computing and connectivity without the shackles of being tethered to a location is one of the biggest disruptive forces of modern times.","Everybody has a different interpretation of immigration problems, and it's a highly personal experience. If anyone tells you there is a uniform solution to it, there isn't. As far as I'm concerned, it worked for me. And I don't know how to fix the problem.","There's only one way to succeed: Show up, work hard, and do everything right. Regardless of who you might be or what kind of job you may have.","On my end, I am still surprised that many media organizations are unable to adapt to new media formats and, more importantly, new network behaviors.","My definition of media? 'Anything which owns attention.' This could be a game or, perhaps, a platform. Ironically, the media tends to associate media with publishing - digital or otherwise - which, in turn, is too narrow a way to consider not only the media but also the reality of the competitive landscape and media-focused innovation.","Whether it is through stock-market trading or the sale of hotel rooms, the Internet has a way of bringing deflationary forces to all businesses that were hitherto inefficient and involved many middlemen.","Some media companies that rely on advertising revenue are tying journalist compensation to the traffic their story generates. It doesn't work because it de-prioritizes writing.","Writing works when publications are writing and serving the best interest of their users; numbers are good yardstick but not a way to compensate a person.","There is better than a good chance that while relaxing on a beach somewhere or sipping a martini in your favorite lounge, you have heard music that makes raise your eyebrow and ask, 'What kind of music is that?'","Internet, for all its faults, exposed me to a lot more music.","We live in crazy times - that is true - and things have gotten crazier, but it still doesn't feel like the turn of the century.","Technology is now part of the social fabric; it is what is causing dislocation. It is the cause of fear amongst all of us.","The digitization of our society is a challenge that is both legislative and philosophical.","Avoid the spectacle of technology and instead focus on technology and science solving real problems.","Many companies that become verbs actually end up modifying our behaviors, and companies that modify behaviors end up becoming behemoths.","In the digital realm, companies are free from the friction of producing physical goods, and as a result, we see companies like Google go from zero dollars in revenues to billions at a much faster rate.","As someone who has been wrong often, I can tell you one thing for sure: hindsight reminds you of your follies every day.","Instead of standing in the way, technology is increasingly an enabler of emotion. A message at the wrong time at dinner can turn a gourmet dish into something insipid because of the interruption."],"Om Puri":["I don't spend on expensive brands. I don't need foreign holidays.","I was very sensitive to the environment around, and this disparity in people, seeing beggars and laborers not paid well, used to disturb me. So these emotions in these roles came very naturally to me.","In theatre, you've got to make the connect with your audience in the first three minutes. If you haven't, you know you've almost lost them.","It is my first preference to do films with social significance. Art cinema has given me credibility and status as an actor, but commercial cinema has given me a comfortable living.","I prefer working in good cinema, wherever it is. I like subjects that have a universal appeal.","What Bollywood lacks is scripts. A lot of the films are copies of western films.","When I was at school, I wanted to join the army. At college, I started acting in college plays, and it became a kind of addiction. I was very shy when I was at school, but the plays seemed to give voice to my feelings.","I had hoped when my life was chronicled, it would be an inspirational story.","When Nandita expressed a desire to write about me, I couldn't stop her because she's my wife, but she has forgotten who she is.","Parallel cinema has not made an effort to communicate in a language the other person understands.","Actors are just soldiers who follow commands.","I have been in the film industry for 35 years, and everyone, including the spot-boys, will vouch for my character.","In western countries, there are roles written for older actors. Films are made on them, including love stories.","I don't expect anything from anybody. When you grow old... Your days are gone; it is part of life.","We have filmmakers who make films with some kind of responsibility and take cinema seriously like Shyam Benegal, Govind Nihalani, Prakash Jha. But now these people also take stars... Without stars they cannot work.","Fat noses have no place in the Hindi film industry. But it is not so in the West - otherwise, Anthony Quinn would have never been an actor.","As a young man, I was very introverted and quiet, but with a lot of intensity and feelings.","Meeting Helen Mirren was a fabulous experience. I had played it out in my mind, how I should greet her when we would be introduced. But the way we met was funny because I just didn't recognise her!","I feel even old people can do a nice love story, but here we don't make that kind of films. In the West, such films are being made and they make a nice romance, which is more like compassion.","Every person wants to stretch himself and widen his audience. Since Hollywood has got more exposure and is shown all over the world, it's obvious that every actor would want to do an English film and explore himself.","I have no regrets at all. I have done quite well for myself. I didn't have a conventional face, but I have done well, and I am proud of it.","I personally enjoy theatre, but preferably I do films so that I can reach up to maximum audience. If you want to give a serious message, it will reach out to maximum people through films. But through theatre, you can hardly reach out to about 3,000 audience at a time.","I am grateful to theatre for making me what I am today. But it's not like theatre is my first love. I am equally attached to cinema, which is, actually, a child of theatre, since it borrows heavily from it.","Theatre is live content, and you can tell if you have worked your audience.","The fact is I like Mumbai less and less. My son says, 'Baba, let's go for a drive', and I tell him, 'Where's the fun of a drive in this place?' You get caught in a million traffic jams, and you spend time cooped in your car with all that mad cacophony around you."],"Omar Ahmad":["We live in a digital world, but we're fairly analog creatures.","One of the things that defines a TEDster is you've taken your passion, and you've turned it into stewardship. You actually put action to the issues you care about.","When you start to think about politicians, you've got to realize these are strange creatures. Other than the fact that they can't tell directions, and they have very strange breeding habits, how do you actually work with these things?","Letters actually work. Even the top dog himself takes time every day to read 10 letters that are picked out by staff. I can tell you that every official that I've ever worked with will tell you about the letters they get and what they mean."],"Omar Bongo":["The free market economy is supposed to be the only path leading to the happiness of humanity by promoting wealth and prosperity, power and influence of nations.","The shock caused by the September 11 events has also lead to a thorough reflection on the existing disparity between rich and poor countries, on the misery of populations of the South.","Instead of ideological objectives of a political nature, today we are faced with ideological objectives of economic nature.","But since independence, Gabon is one of the few countries in Central Africa that enjoys peace and stability.","Therefore, every country has to understand that fighting against international terrorism is not for the sake of the United States, but for the sake of themselves, and, to a larger extent, in the name of stability of international relations.","My actions to promote peace, the mediation missions which I carried out during many conflicts, which very often occurred between brothers of the same country, are not driven by any ulterior motives or any calculations based on personal ambitions.","The world is now aware that the most unavoidable and most dangerous weapon that exists is the blind decisiveness of a man ready to sacrifice his life for an obscure cause.","It is not right to associate the fight against international terrorist networks with an imaginary crusade against Islam.","Do not forget that the Arab countries, starting with Algeria and Egypt, are the ones that have paid the heaviest toll because of Islamic terror.","It is important to stress: Africa is also a victim of the September 11 attacks.","Because the world is in economic recession, which worsened since this drama happened, and our country will bear the burden of all of these consequences.","From the time of independences until the end of the Cold War, in spite of the participation of a considerable number of African states in the non-aligned movement, everyone in fact chose to align with one or another of the two major blocks.","If the Soviet Union and the United States have not experienced direct military confrontations, on the other hand, they supported, armed and trained Africans, to fight other Africans.","Globalization, far from putting an end to power diplomacy between States, has, on the contrary, intensified it.","In spite of our poverty and our economic dependence, we do not have to give in, neither because we are sometimes abandoned nor because of the wish of some nations to impose their economic or political models.","Certainly, Africa accounts for only l % of world trade, and we cannot assure our development on our own.","The birth of the African Union should encourage us to reexamine relations between African States.","It is up to African leaders to show their will and political courage in order to assure that this new pan-African institution becomes an efficient instrument and not a place for endless discussions.","The African Union has to act in order to put an end to armed conflicts that undermine the continent, to fight against the devastation caused by AIDS and other contagious diseases, to promote sustainable development of its member states.","I'm not aiming for the Nobel Peace Prize!","In short, we have, among African countries, a duty of solidarity.","There is an idea of democracy produced by one-sided thinking.","In brief, Western democracy, as other political models, is not exportable to all regions of the world.","The introduction of political pluralism often quickly led to bad results.","For about ten years now, the struggle for democracy and the respect of human rights has been in the focus point - if not a commodity - of political groups aiming to rise to power.","I am in favor of complete freedom of information and of free access to the new communication tools, in particular the Internet.","Information on the Internet must be as free as in the newspapers.","The resources of our continent attract, more than ever, the interests of rich countries.","But the Western countries that link their partnership with the poorest countries with respect for democracy also have to consider that they have obligations towards these countries.","When they favor the access of other people to education and health care, the countries of the North not only demonstrate generosity or solidarity, but also implement the principles of respecting and promoting human rights.","The principle of responsibility and collective sanctions is incompatible with the Western concept of justice.","But it is important to observe that when Europe or the United Nations impose sanctions that are supposed to be aimed against a certain regime, usually generally millions of people end up being directly punished.","Economic sanctions rarely achieve the desired results."],"Omar Dorsey":["I work with a group of actors, and whenever one of us has an audition, we all get together, and we all work together on it. I think it takes us back to our film school days, our drama school days, us just working together and figuring it out because somebody else is going to see something in the material that you won't see.","My kids are in school and in all these clubs - chess club, fashion club, you name it. When my dad came home from work, it was late, and when he left, it was early in the morning. On my days off, I'm still taking my kids to school and picking them up. I do what I have to do to keep that relationship.","Because I'm a big guy, I was always playing the bad guy or whatever, but after I did 'The Blind Side,' where I played a father who's a really loving, likeable sort of person, a lot of those barriers were broken down. People saw me as something softer, not so much as a heavy anymore.","Sometimes a time dictates what a film will be. Sometimes a film dictates what the time will be.","Ava DuVernay is my personal Phil Jackson. She's a perfect coach.","I worked with James Orange and Hosea Williams as a teenager, and he's portrayed in the movie by Wendell Pierce. So, for me to be able to come in, 20 years after working with them as a teenager, and to portray Reverend James Orange in 'Selma' is mind-blowing.","Dontel Benjamin on 'Eastbound' is a loud-mouth, braggadocios, crazy man, while Roy on 'Rake' is a very deliberate, thoughtful man, and he doesn't scream a lot.","It takes a while for audiences on film to see you as something different if they've seen you for so long as a specific character. It's up to the actor to be like, 'Look man, let's try something else,' even if it's an ultra-low-budget independent. People who rep you will keep going with whatever they can send you on.","When I was a kid, I used to make up all these characters. I love comedy a lot, and I don't get to do it often. Somewhere in the middle, I shifted into doing drama.","At the end of the day, I want to be a teacher at a university, teaching film or acting."],"Omar Epps":["People are realizing that color has no bearing on what's known as brotherhood.","If someone saves your life, you develop a brotherhood, no matter what your race.","Boxing, for me, it's the beginning of all sports. I'm willing to bet that the first sport was a man against another man in a fight, so I think that's something innate in all of us.","We were all Romans once, I guess.","I like boxing movies. One of the hardest things for me to watch as far as boxing films, is the boxing. The actual boxing usually sucks.","The world is as it should be.","I've never taken myself too seriously.","Writing is the beast unto itself.","Whatever art form you're working in, it's crucial to see it clearly, to feel it clearly, and not to worry about the results, or how someone else will see it.","People don't want to pay 8 or 9 dollars to go see a problem that they have in their life, on screen. They pay to get away from that. That's why they watch soap operas.","I believe success is preparation, because opportunity is going to knock on your door sooner or later but are you prepared to answer that?","There's show and there's business. Business is a whole other beat.","The only way to ensure a film is going to sell is put Will Smith in it and you open it in 3,000 theaters and make sure we have all the top promotional spots in each venue.","You want to live your own life, but when you have fame, there are certain things you can't get away with.","That word, fan, has always kind of bothered me.","It's natural for any actor that segues into directing to be an actor's director. You know how to relate to the actors.","I spend 90 percent of my time saying no, and my accountant yells at me for it, but when I started in this business, I wanted my career to have legs.","A lot of directors are overbearing and tend to make you doubt your instincts."],"Omar Khayyam":["Be happy for this moment. This moment is your life.","The Flower that once has blown forever dies.","A loaf of bread, a jug of wine, and thou.","The thoughtful soul to solitude retires.","A hair divides what is false and true.","The moving finger writes, and having written moves on. Nor all thy piety nor all thy wit, can cancel half a line of it.","Myself when young did eagerly frequent doctor and saint, and heard great argument about it and about: but evermore came out by the same door as in I went.","When I want to understand what is happening today or try to decide what will happen tomorrow, I look back.","There was a door to which I found no key: There was the veil through which I might not see.","Drink! for you know not whence you came nor why: drink! for you know not why you go, nor where.","Living Life Tomorrow's fate, though thou be wise, Thou canst not tell nor yet surmise; Pass, therefore, not today in vain, For it will never come again.","You know, my friends, with what a brave carouse I made a Second Marriage in my house; favored old barren reason from my bed, and took the daughter of the vine to spouse.","The Worldly Hope men set their Hearts upon Turns Ashes - or it prospers; and anon, Like Snow upon the Desert's dusty Face, Lighting a little hour or two - is gone."],"Omar N. Bradley":["Set your course by the stars, not by the lights of every passing ship.","Bravery is the capacity to perform properly even when scared half to death.","This is as true in everyday life as it is in battle: we are given one life and the decision is ours whether to wait for circumstances to make up our mind, or whether to act, and in acting, to live.","We have grasped the mystery of the atom and rejected the sermon on the mount.","If we continue to develop our technology without wisdom or prudence, our servant may prove to be our executioner.","Wars can be prevented just as surely as they can be provoked, and we who fail to prevent them, must share the guilt for the dead.","Ours is a world of nuclear giants and ethical infants. We know more about war that we know about peace, more about killing that we know about living.","The way to win an atomic war is to make certain it never starts.","Leadership is intangible, and therefore no weapon ever designed can replace it.","With the monstrous weapons man already has, humanity is in danger of being trapped in this world by its moral adolescents.","We know more about war than we know about peace, more about killing than we know about living.","In a completely integrated unit where you'd have white soldiers, particularly from southern states, serving under black noncommissioned officers or officers... I think you would have a problem definitely.","I am convinced that the best service a retired general can perform is to turn in his tongue along with his suit and to mothball his opinions."],"Omar Sharif":["My philosophy is that when I go out of my room, I'm prepared to love everybody I meet, unless they're bad.","I don't know what sex appeal is. I don't think you can have sex appeal knowingly. The people who seduce me personally are the people who seem not to know they're seductive, and not to know they have sex appeal.","Working gets in the way of living.","I don't think any actor feels comfortable watching themselves in movies. You must be very narcissistic. The problem with your own opinion of yourself is that contrary to the normal spectators, when you watch a film you are in, you only watch yourself.","I want to live every moment totally and intensely. Even when I'm giving an interview or talking to people, that's all that I'm thinking about.","I didn't want to be a slave to any passion anymore. I gave up card playing altogether, even bridge and gambling - more or less. It took me a few years to get out of it.","I'd rather be playing bridge than making a bad movie.","Women know when they've got the menopause but men don't quite know. They know it afterwards.","I was a fat little boy when I was 10 years old! My mother, who didn't speak any English at all, said, 'I know the only thing is to put him in an English boarding school. The food will be so horrible that he'll lose his weight.'","I don't know what women are attracted to. I can't tell, but certainly I have no notion of having sex appeal or being seductive in any way.","They didn't accept me theory - not a theory, but just a thought I had about this character. I noticed that this man only exists when the boy comes into the grocery.","This character in the film, these things that he says which sound like advice and wise things, they are very common for Orientals. It's all the tradition.","I see only defects because I'm not following the scene as it were. I'm not following the other person. It's like the best thing to clarify this is the theater.","He read his mind. He's a strange sort of man, isn't he? It's not just the advice and the wisdom that he has.","I tried on a moustache, and it was decided I would grow one. I've shaved it off for a couple of films, but otherwise, I've had it ever since.","I love to be with my son and my grandchildren, like normal people. I have no particular idea of what I represent to other people. It's very mysterious to me. I don't understand it.","There are lots of wonderful old Italian actors. You don't need to take an Egyptian to play an Italian actor.","I'm very wary about giving advice. I think it's very dangerous to give advice to people, except if you know them very well.","I had too many big passions in life and it gets in the way of work. You can't concentrate properly on the one thing.","I can't say I gave up totally my passion for women but almost.","The reason it has relevance is because I, as a popular Arab personality - the Arab people like me and respect me - thought it was time for me to make an ever so tiny statement about what I thought about this whole thing.","This is one of the factors that also made me very much want to make this film, apart from the fact that I loved it. If the boy hadn't been Jewish and the man hadn't been Muslim, it wouldn't have made any difference to the film. I don't think it's relevant, really.","See these hands? They are old. But they are soft. Only good for caressing.","My mother used to play cards with King Farouk. He believed she brought good luck to him - she was his mascot.","From the age of 31, I have lived in hotels.","I like football very much. That's what I like. I play it quite well.","I made French films and other films and a lot of Arabic films, but what I like is English for myself.","Peter O'Toole - I really loved that man. They sent me into the desert, and I lived there with him for 100 days. And there were no women! Can you believe it?","Children are wonderful!","I don't think I could live without a deck of cards in my hands."],"Omar Sy":["When I was young, a lot of things were closed off to me. I was always told, 'Don't do this, you can't do that' - instead of stopping me, it made me think, 'I can do that, I must do that.'","I understood from a very young age that school was important and that my parents were making great sacrifices for me. Every morning I saw my father get up and go to a job that he didn't really like. They came to France for the same reasons all immigrants move to another country - so their kids could have a better way of life.","When I was a boy, my older brothers listened to Earth, Wind & Fire and Kool and the Gang. When I would try to get into their room, they would close the door and say, 'You can't hear that. It's not for a child!' Now, I can listen to it and enjoy it.","I really like to kid around, and it's my own way of concentrating. In order for me to be able to feel better and concentrate, I need everybody else around me to be relaxed.","I'm definitely more at ease with comedy - that's where I started out - and so it's my first love, so to speak, and I have more of a sensibility for it and more familiar with it. Having said that, I also want to be open to everything else.","Nothing in my younger life could have told me I would have needed to know how to speak English.","People only look at you and say, 'You are black and you are from the banlieue,' and all the doors are closed. I had the desire to be something else. If I see a door that is a little open, I will find a way to get through.","I began in radio in 1997 on a radio show hosted by a now very famous comic, Jamel Debbouze. I would fake call listeners.","I never predicted that I'd be a comedian, but it was something that came so naturally to me. I just felt good doing it."],"Omar Torrijos Herrera":["Regarding the Panama Canal Treaty negotiations, they will find us standing up or dead, but never on our knees; NEVER!","I don't like Communism because it hands out wealth through rationing books.","He who gives love, receives love.","If I fall, pick up the flag, kiss it, and keep on going."],"Omari Hardwick":["Shoes make an outfit; they're like rims for a car.","I would honestly say I'm in the turtle's race. My journey is a marathon.","Some of the most amazing people I've met in life are cops.","Life as a poet and actor truly became full circle as I stood on stage as host of 'Verses & Flow' and lived in both of these outfits. It was one of the best experiences of my professional life.","Know that the tattoos are all significant. They're all extremely insignificant. I can't break each one down, but it's 20 years. The first one was 21 years of age from a football teammate.","Sometimes my schedule doesn't allow time to go to the hotel after I get off the plane, so I bring my Freebird boots or my old school Adidas shell-toes to throw on after I land.","It's an interesting thing to play the heroes of our society, like cops and firefighters. They're the basic heroes that, as little boys and little girls, you look up to as the first heroes of your small, specific community.","If reality shows are so popular, that means their viewers are screaming for more realness.","I know that Donald Trump is a smart man.","I was trying to pay the bills with poems, and it was easy to memorize my poems, because I'd be riding my bike in California trying to memorize them before going on stage at a poetry lounge.","You don't go to church and tell the choir how to sing if you're a visitor.","I grew up in a two-parent household. We all played sports, all sports, which cost a lot of money. My pops was an attorney; he went to College of the Holy Cross with Clarence Thomas. My mom worked a bit, then gradually came home and took care of us full time.","You know, I think anybody who has been in relationships has access to heartbreak - I don't think we have to go far to find it, whether we inflicted the heartbreak or whether we were the recipient of it.","The way the recession has affected Hollywood, a lot of actors that had robust opportunities before in film no longer have such plum options, so cable has done a good job of becoming a happy medium for artists deemed film actors.","For me, I'm always looking for the opportunity for a character that challenges me and lets me play two for the price of one.","What we have as artists is the immortalization opportunity that others don't have, because our work is lasting; it's there forever to view.","As an African-American male born with a couple of strikes against you because of your skin color, I think it's very, very important to have some positive role models around, especially male influences.","When you start out on a project as an actor, you know, you approach the character from the standpoint of maybe writing a list - even if it's a mental list that you make - of the adjectives that the character has or that character possesses.","I think, by nature you know, I'm very attracted and I gravitate toward the very strong girl who can watch a ballgame, but who's also extremely feminine.","I've been described as a smart actor because I've attended college. Or I've been called an artsy jock. And I am thinking, 'So, are actors supposed to be dumb?'","Actors are intelligent. Yet, many of them do not communicate well. That's what makes it so hard to have a relationship with one.","When it's all said and done, I am secure enough with my manhood to say to the world, 'I am a male actor, and its okay for me to play a gay man.'","Poetry has, in a way, been my bridge to my acting career.","As a poet, I would always hear emcees come up to me and say, 'Yo, you should rap,' and I was like, 'No.' You know, the label was tough for me. I'm a poet. I was proud of that distinction between the two, not wanting to be the other.","For a long time, I had been very secretive about a lot of the things I'd been through personally, and a lot of that is purposeful. My fan base, for the large part, is the younger generation. They're like, 'I want to know everything! I want to know it all!'","I was at UGA playing with Champ Bailey and Hines Ward - both guys who will probably touch the Hall of Fame one day.","I use Aveeno cleansers and moisturizers.","I think Gil Scott-Heron is a king. He's a brilliant, broken king.","I don't think you really have chemistry in the way that you want between two actors unless frustration is there as well.","I'd done 'Peter Pan' in a little pre-K class or whatever.","I found poetry at 12 and 13 and, lo and behold, learned that my attorney father had a background in poetry - as he wore dashikis and Afros in the '70s and named his kids Arabic names. He was a poet and a lot like The Last Poets and Gil Scott-Heron and all of these folks. He definitely was an artist.","I think the universe just brings people around others they find to be interesting.","When I think about the person who's been most in my ear, it's Joe Dumars.","I always had an interest in telling stories.","To make your own family is just the most empowering thing ever. It's the greatest thing you can ever pull off.","Real to Reel is a rare opportunity for new filmmakers to screen their work for industry insiders.","I'm such a carnivorous researcher as an actor - I chew it up like it's meat, and I really don't know how to do that without the people that are producing or creating or writing that which they want me to chew up.","I'm safe where I'm at just being the guy where people go, 'That's a really good actor. What's his name again?' I liked being at that place.","The reality is our story and the way we love and our taste in clothing and everything else. And what we ambitiously feel we can be.","I was going from Furman to the University of Georgia. I transferred to play football.","I have very much been a guy who's acknowledged how many women have directed me, have produced... it's been unbelievable.","Women are so necessary for us in terms of support.","Deciding to not attach ourselves to something that doesn't appropriately represent us is extremely powerful.","You can't look at the dollar and say, 'I'm not what I dreamed of being unless I do this type of movie and it's a blockbuster that gives me this amount of dollars.' That's not good.","If you remain open to great directors who look like you, who know what they're doing and are making impactful films that are destroying these 'blockbuster films,' you can do okay, and everybody can get more of a piece of the pie. But you've got to be open and brave.","Women are amazing lovers.","A powerful person is equally cool with their flaws and things that aren't powerful about them at all.","I come from the stage, so I started in New York, lived there for eleven years.","I did 'Fences' off-broadway at the Beacon Theater, so it's amazing that Denzel Washington and Viola Davis brought it to Broadway.","I worked on the workshop of 'Topdog/Underdog' before it went to Broadway. My minor in school was theater, so I'm based in that, and then I moved to Los Angeles.","I'm not shutting myself off from kids; I'm remaining open to kids and the energy that they bring.","We are a total of our sum parts, right? I came from a family of very strong women - black women. And if I go back as far as my great grandmothers, there was always that love and the ability to be nurturing. Then I grew up in a household where my father was the one who was more affectionate with me.","I was definitely a Daddy's boy.","I'd say my artistic bent definitely came from my father, who was a trial lawyer. And if you're smart, you know that a trial lawyer isn't that different from an actor. He was a poet as well.","I was raised looking at women who were strong, and they weren't really into playing race cards or playing gender cards. I didn't grow up around women who were like, 'Well, let the boys do that, and let the girls do that.' I didn't really see that in my house.","So many athletes who have been close to me have been everything to me.","That's the thing with me being a former athlete: in the way I attack characters and attack poetry is from the base of being an athlete.","I got in trouble for saying I would move my family to Europe, but I said it.","I'm addicted to the hotel life. It's humbling and fly at the same time.","I always have a backpack. I was a poet, so it reminds me of being a backpack poet.","I think 'Dark Blue' came to me while I was doing a project in London. I read it, and the character immediately popped out at me.","It's really rare to come across a character, a show, or a movie that allows you to completely play four or five different characters within a season, let alone a week.","Playing a cop goes a long way. I have a lot of friends who are working as actors, and as soon as I started playing military characters or cops, and not the actual criminal that we're chasing on this show, they all said, 'You actually can have a career now.'","I'm always like, 'Well, let's not rest on a critical acclaim or on a incredible review or on a great reception.'","I tend to want to put my fingers over my ears and not hear all of that, not hear that there are so many fans.","'Dark Blue' was a really solid show, and it stopped at season two.","As an actor, I come to set, and I have already broken the character down by writing a poem about the character. I try to write in his voice, the way he would write it.","I've approached every character I've ever played with a poem, first and foremost.","I think I'm an athlete who's trained as an actor, and when you smash it all together, you get whatever Omari is doing as a performer right now.","I think actors make for very good directors, and I would like to do that one day.","If I could remake any Eighties project, it would be less an action flick than a character-driven drama with a rich story to tell.","Like anybody who grew up in the Eighties, I cringe at the thought of these movies being remade, because of the corniness and cheesiness of the originals.","If I can just be thought of as Omari Hardwick who had a really, really solid career, and whose work is appreciated in its own right, I think that would be a great legacy to leave behind.","It's rare for artists to really stare deeply at themselves in the mirror, literally, because there's constantly a mirror on you.","I don't think there's a fan out there who hasn't had a family member or known someone personally who's been in the midst of divorce - perhaps not necessarily gotten the divorce or executed it, or perhaps they have - and still, in many cases, they found themselves back with the person that they were married to.","I grew up in Decatur, Georgia. We had three boys in the household; actually, it felt like four of us. My pops sort of raised my uncle, too. So, it was four boys and, later, a younger sister.","I don't make a big deal out of playing football at UGA to people who have interviewed me.","Unlike many Californians or New Yorkers, college football is a religion down south.","'Power' is a funny thing. Maybe it's a show that draws people in because they are watching people do things they secretly wish they could do or know they could get away with.","On 'Being Mary Jane,' I learned to embrace sex symbol.","I realized, 'Oh, it's easier to get what I want if I embrace the sex symbol thing.' Microphones are more in my face, and I can say things about the kids that I mentor and open more access to more doors.","I've definitely had my moments in relationships where I've been able to say yes, I have been heartbroken, my heart has been broken.","I think what's most important is family.","You know how you can be romantic? You can be romantic by going to a beautiful setting, sitting on a park bench, and getting good ole-fashioned golden arches, a.k.a. McDonald's. That's probably the best I can do romantically.","That point of life when I learned I could cook, that always made me understand what cooks felt like feeding other people. It's okay to receive, but it's really cool to give, so food is to me sexy because it's the fact that someone is giving it to someone else.","I've been writing for years, you know, and when I get to a particular place, city, or different locale, I find myself first of all being challenged by those that love me to write more.","'Power' is really such a good show that I forget I'm in it sometimes.","I always go into a character thinking, 'If it scares me, I can do it.'","I didn't want to just do a show where my character stood out and other characters were flat or one-to-two-dimensional. I wanted everybody to have meat.","I'm a black Catholic raised in Decatur, Georgia, which was very gang-infested. Then, I went to an all-white private high school and excelled in sports and wrote poetry, then played football at the University of Georgia, minoring in drama.","I was a 200-pound defensive back on Saturday, but after the season, I was performing 'Lysistrata' or 'Fences.'","If your character is just out there acting a fool, viewers are gonna say, 'Why am I watching this?' But if he's whispering, 'I don't really want to die,' there's a level of vulnerability cemented in these bad characters.","Poetry is almost like my foundation for everything. I almost feel I am a better actor and writer because of it.","Spike Lee gave me the greatest reaction to the fact that I was this athlete-meets-artist, because I think he saw that I was different. I learned that oftentimes, Spike directs in a sense that he might just stare at you and look at you in a telepathic way of communicating.","I would say that the woman's ability to multi-task and to be maternal in instinct, it fosters a different approach to the character that makes sense as an actor.","I kept on hearing the voice of God saying if you are going to be the minister that your mom mentioned... then you have to act. My pulpit is acting.","I would say, as loving as I am... I am definitely an extremely temperamental man who has a very large temper.","Acting is the art of being and existing, and not being fake.","My dad was really complex, and I was raised by that. My mom is really bright - very book bright - and so those things collide... I learned that I could put all of that stuff together in the world of acting, and I could make a dollar at it.","There were uncles in my life that definitely knew the street life.","I'm really nerdy, and I read a lot.","I was at a ballpark as much as I was in school. I was on a basketball court or football field as much as I was in school, so I definitely was receiving mentorship when it came to coaches, my father, my grandfather, and my uncles.","Craft is everything.","People are fond of that 'crabs in a barrel' mentality, and I'm like, 'No, there needs to be more so we can create more barrels; there doesn't need to be one barrel.'","For me, music was a cathartic way to free me from the nut of Ghost. After working on set for 'Power' for 14 hours, it allowed me to pour my sanity and insanity into the music.","I really had a problem with being 'the man.' I'm past it now, but that was my insecurity. I ran from that. I was cool with being No. 3 on the call sheet or No. 2.","For me, I went from showering at the YMCA in L.A., eating chicken sandwiches and ramen noodles if lucky, and going from couch to couch. I'm a real story. I know the struggle."],"Omri Katz":["I always look for my mistakes so I can correct them in the future.","I'm having more fun working on 'Eerie, Indiana' because I have the leading role, and this is more of a lighter type of show.","I would love to work with the great movie actors of our time.","I think 'Eerie, Indiana' is a show for young people."],"Oona Chaplin":["As I don't know what life would be like without my Chaplin connections, I work with them. I'm just really happy it's a family I can be proud of; it's not as if I'm related to some Z-list celebrity.","Watching yourself on screen is always a little weird, but I didn't cringe when I saw myself on 'The Hour.' It actually exceeded my expectations; every shot looks like a vintage postcard and even my most brutally honest friends have said they think it's good.","When people say 'Charlie Chaplin' I still think now of the guy in the moustache and bowler hat and funny walk - I don't think of an old man who was my grandfather.","I don't buy things now, I buy plane tickets. The only thing I want is to make enough money to be able to travel with my children.","My mother doesn't have much of a social life with other A-list people. Which in a way I'm very grateful for, because if I do make something of my career I will be able to say it wasn't because I was a Chaplin.","My grandmother died in 1991 and I was born in '86. We only met once, but I didn't speak English and she didn't speak Spanish - so we had a communication problem.","My flat in Ladbroke Grove, west London, is in the best building in the world. It's like a commune - everyone gets on - and on Friday evenings I often cook us all dinner.","I loved being on stage, but I told myself that if I didn't get into RADA, I wouldn't pursue an acting career. I did get in, though, and that was that.","I'm a big fan of David Attenborough, who I think is the most adventurous of the nature program presenters.","I'm part Cuban, so anything with a good beat like Rumberos de Cuba gets me going.","I love boxing. I box in a local boxing gym in London. I usually spar. But I've done two fights and I lost both of them admirably. I didn't realize how much it would hurt for them to actually hit me.","I have to go through auditions, and my surname has got me into rooms, but I'll never know if it gets me any jobs. There's a lot of sexism and objectification, and a lot of people put you down.","People think that I can just walk into a room and get a job, but of the 200 interviews and auditions I go through a year, I may get three yeses. I just have to use my sense of humour to get me through."],"Ophelia Lovibond":["The '60s look wasn't something I consciously chose, but in my late teens, I found myself styling my hair in a retro way and liking clothes - the shapes and silhouettes - that were from that era. They just reflected who I was.","I realized I have an appetite for stunts. I learned how to do them myself.","I've never read a self help book... the most self-help I've read is on a beer mat.","I don't have any irrational fears. Obviously, if I was walking through the outback, and I saw a snake, I wouldn't go up and stroke it, but I wouldn't run screaming from it, either.","I've done a lot of comedy recently, so I would really like to explore something else. I am hankering after a really meaty, dramatic role... like Natalie Portman's part in Black Swan.'","When I started acting professionally, it really felt like an extension of just playing around - it was all very organic.","I don't believe in having safety nets - you'll end up using them!","The first thing I look at with a project isn't who's directing, whether it's a big film; it's the character and whether I want to tell her story.","I don't quite have the luxury of cherry-picking - I have to see what comes my way. But I have always been picky.","I love the '60s - that's my comfort zone as far as dressing goes.","Growing up, I was surrounded by music by the Stones, Carole King, and the Beach Boys. I didn't know who Michael Jackson was till I was about 13.","If you asked me to sing a modern song, I wouldn't be able to - I can't easily slip into that groove. But if it were a song by Nico or The Velvet Underground, fine.","My golf swing is probably the most horrendous you've ever seen. I look like I'm trying to attack the ball.","You're sent scripts, and for some, as soon as you start reading them, you feel an instant connection to the character. You know who they are, you know how to play them, and there is instant enthusiasm. Then, at the audition, you don't have nerves because of that natural affinity.","The most romantic thing someone did was surprise me at the airport, after being away for 3 months in Los Angeles. You always see people with signs, and you're like, 'Isn't that lovely?' and then you see your own name on one - that isn't a taxi driver's! I was very impressed.","Oh my God, I would love to go on stage so much. I'm undignified with how badly I want it.","All the other characters are so well-rounded, and it's just frustrating because female characters aren't. It's not that they're badly written, they're just underwritten. They have no internal monologues; they could be absolutely anyone.","I'm quite nosy. Somebody will be reading a book on a train, and I'll go: 'How is it? Is it any good?' and they'll be like, 'Yeah, now let me read it.'","I love going to cities and getting lost. I love doing that rather than following a guidebook.","Everyone talks about the big three-oh with dread - but it's exciting. It feels like life is much more put together. Everyone's like, 'Wouldn't you like to be 20 again?' But no way.","I get scripts and think, 'There's not enough here to get my teeth stuck into.' That's a result of studying English, where you luxuriate in these big, lush novels.","I used to sing in jazz clubs with a friend until she went another way.","If I read something and respond to the role, that's what happens, and if those happen to be a few comedies in a row, or not, so be it."],"Oprah Winfrey":["The biggest adventure you can take is to live the life of your dreams.","Think like a queen. A queen is not afraid to fail. Failure is another steppingstone to greatness.","The more you praise and celebrate your life, the more there is in life to celebrate.","Passion is energy. Feel the power that comes from focusing on what excites you.","You can either see yourself as a wave in the ocean or you can see yourself as the ocean.","Real integrity is doing the right thing, knowing that nobody's going to know whether you did it or not.","Surround yourself with only people who are going to lift you higher.","Where there is no struggle, there is no strength.","Be thankful for what you have; you'll end up having more. If you concentrate on what you don't have, you will never, ever have enough.","I still have my feet on the ground, I just wear better shoes.","Do the one thing you think you cannot do. Fail at it. Try again. Do better the second time. The only people who never tumble are those who never mount the high wire. This is your moment. Own it.","The struggle of my life created empathy - I could relate to pain, being abandoned, having people not love me.","Lots of people want to ride with you in the limo, but what you want is someone who will take the bus with you when the limo breaks down.","Breathe. Let go. And remind yourself that this very moment is the only one you know you have for sure.","Being human means you will make mistakes. And you will make mistakes, because failure is God's way of moving you in another direction.","The challenge of life, I have found, is to build a resume that doesn't simply tell a story about what you want to be, but it's a story about who you want to be.","The greatest discovery of all time is that a person can change his future by merely changing his attitude.","Doing the best at this moment puts you in the best place for the next moment.","I am a woman in process. I'm just trying like everybody else. I try to take every conflict, every experience, and learn from it. Life is never dull.","When I look into the future, it's so bright it burns my eyes.","Follow your instincts. That's where true wisdom manifests itself.","I believe that every single event in life happens in an opportunity to choose love over fear.","Every stumble is not a fall, and every fall does not mean failure.","You become what you believe, not what you think or what you want.","With age comes the understanding and appreciation of your most important asset, your health.","I always knew I was destined for greatness.","Cheers to a new year and another chance for us to get it right.","Excellence is the best deterrent to racism or sexism.","If you want to feel good, you have to go out and do some good.","So go ahead. Fall down. The world looks different from the ground.","My idea of heaven is a great big baked potato and someone to share it with.","You CAN have it all. You just can't have it all at once.","Turn your wounds into wisdom.","What God intended for you goes far beyond anything you can imagine.","You are responsible for the energy that you create for yourself, and you're responsible for the energy that you bring to others.","No matter who we are or what we look like or what we may believe, it is both possible and, more importantly, it becomes powerful to come together in common purpose and common effort.","The whole point of being alive is to evolve into the complete person you were intended to be.","I don't think of myself as a poor deprived ghetto girl who made good. I think of myself as somebody who from an early age knew I was responsible for myself, and I had to make good.","I was raised to believe that excellence is the best deterrent to racism or sexism. And that's how I operate my life.","Don't let people talk you into what they think is you.","Your job is not just to do what your parents say, what your teachers say, what society says, but to figure out what your heart calling is and to be led by that.","You know you are on the road to success if you would do your job, and not be paid for it.","If you want to accomplish the goals of your life, you have to begin with the spirit.","The thing you fear most has no power. Your fear of it is what has the power. Facing the truth really will set you free.","For everyone of us that succeeds, it's because there's somebody there to show you the way out.","Books were my pass to personal freedom. I learned to read at age three, and soon discovered there was a whole world to conquer that went beyond our farm in Mississippi.","You're either humble or you're not. If you were a jerk before the fame, you just become a jerk with a bigger spotlight. Whoever you are really comes through.","Biology is the least of what makes someone a mother.","When you think about growing and being empowered yourself, it is what you've been able to do for other people that leaves you the fullest.","What material success does is provide you with the ability to concentrate on other things that really matter. And that is being able to make a difference, not only in your own life, but in other people's lives.","I think people who have good parents come into the world with a strength, yes, and an advantage.","I'm not even kind of a lesbian.","Over the years, I've interviewed thousands of people, most of them women, and I would say that the root of every dysfunction I've ever encountered, every problem, has been some sense of a lacking of self-value or of self-worth.","The goal of my shows, my interviews, my business, my philanthropy, all of it, whatever ventures I might pursue, would be to make clear that what unites us is ultimately far more redeeming and compelling than anything that separates me.","My first day in Chicago, September 4, 1983. I set foot in this city, and just walking down the street, it was like roots, like the motherland. I knew I belonged here.","Every day, you're only as good as your last show.","My therapy has come from paying attention to my life.","Whatever has happened to you in your past has no power over this present moment, because life is now.","My whole reason for creating a network is literally to bring little pieces of light. It's to continue to spread little pieces of light in the world, to illuminate the possibility of the human spirit.","Understand that the right to choose your own path is a sacred privilege. Use it. Dwell in possibility.","My philosophy is that not only are you responsible for your life, but doing the best at this moment puts you I the best place for the next moment.","If you come to fame not understanding who you are, it will define who you are.","Even if you flippin' fries at McDonald's, if you are excellent, everybody wants to be in your line.","I feel that luck is preparation meeting opportunity.","I'm black, I don't feel burdened by it and I don't think it's a huge responsibility. It's part of who I am. It does not define me.","As you become more clear about who you really are, you'll be better able to decide what is best for you - the first time around.","I don't believe in failure. It is not failure if you enjoyed the process.","I have a lot of things to prove to myself. One is that I can live my life fearlessly.","I'm sick of people sittin' in chairs stating their problems. Then we roll the videotape... then we have our experts on the topic... I'm in the 'What's next?' phase of my career.","I don't think you ever stop giving. I really don't. I think it's an on-going process. And it's not just about being able to write a check. It's being able to touch somebody's life.","Money is worth nothing if it can't buy you the opportunity to love more.","I had no idea that being your authentic self could make me as rich as I've become. If I had, I'd have done it a lot earlier.","When you forgive somebody, it doesn't necessarily mean you want to invite them to your table.","When you're the most successful person in your family, in your neighborhood, and in your town, everybody thinks you're the First National Bank, and you have to figure out for yourself where those boundaries are.","What I know is, is that if you do work that you love, and the work fulfills you, the rest will come.","I always feel that until you take your last breath, you're always growing.","It does not matter how you came into the world, what matters is that you are here.","Acting is about going into the space, and there are just some places that I'm not willing to go.","Look at how hard it was to get to where I am. It doesn't make sense to give it up.","It isn't until you come to a spiritual understanding of who you are - not necessarily a religious feeling, but deep down, the spirit within - that you can begin to take control.","Unless you choose to do great things with it, it makes no difference how much you are rewarded, or how much power you have.","I know that inner wisdom is more precious than wealth. The more you spend it, the more you gain.","That's the gift that a mother can give, to make everyone feel like they are the special one.","If you're constantly pushing yourself higher, higher, the law of averages - not to mention the myth of Icarus - predicts that you will at some point fall. And when you do, I want you to know this, remember this: There is no such thing as failure.","You are who you are at this moment because of everything that's ever happened to you, everything that you carried forward for yourself.","It's much easier for me to make major life, multi-million dollar decisions, than it is to decide on a carpet for my front porch. That's the truth.","You alone are enough.","Love somebody. Just one person. And then spread that to two. And as many as you can. You'll see the difference it makes.","I remember a specific moment, watching my grandmother hang the clothes on the line, and her saying to me, 'you are going to have to learn to do this,' and me being in that space of awareness and knowing that my life would not be the same as my grandmother's life.","I had become so accustomed to succeeding that I no longer even remembered what it was like to fail.","I consider the world, this Earth, to be like a school, and our life the classrooms.","I try to basically keep my opinions to myself when it comes to people who are charged with crimes that I don't know anything about.","Even people who believe they deserve to be happy and have nice things often don't feel worthy once they have them.","To me, the money is - it's certainly a wonderful thing. But it is in direct proportion to how you're able to bless yourself and bless others with it.","Most people honestly want to do as well as they can in their lives."],"Oral Roberts":["I am charismatic with roots of the Pentecostal.","Well, I can't figure out God.","God wants you well. God wants you prosperous. God wants you a whole person."],"Oren Peli":["The thing I find really scary about ghosts and demons is that you don't really know what they are or where they are. They're not very well understood. You don't know what they want from you. So it's the kind of thing you don't even know how to defend yourself against. Anything that's unknown and mysterious is very scary.","There is so much misinformation out there. If you give people even a little bit, it gets blown out of proportion then you have to go put out fires. So it's much easier to say, 'No comment.'","I've always had better luck learning things on my own. And I really love the challenge of doing it yourself and kind of being alone against the system.","It's always about finding the right balance between answering some questions and raising new ones to keep your story going.","Our lives are pretty calm. Merging on the freeway in the closest you get to risking your life. So what's missing now is that primal emotion of being scared to death, and I think that's why people crave thrills like roller coasters or scary movies. They give you the chance to feel this very primal emotion in a very controlled environment.","I do not buy CDs any more; I usually stream Internet radio. For movies, I hardly every buy any DVDS. I have a DVR, so just record things off HBO, Showtime and so on.","The less people know about 'Paranormal Activity,' the more they enjoy it.","I've been having a lot of fun exploring different aspects of filmmaking, like writing and producing. There isn't a specific plan and I usually don't know what's going to be the next thing I do.","Even when I was making the first 'Paranormal Activity,' I didn't tell anyone I was making it, not my friends or neighbors or co-workers. I just kind of found that there was nothing to gain by announcing to the world that you're doing something.","By trade, I am a software programmer, so I never really had any experience with movies before. I started out with 'Paranormal Activity.'","Gory stuff can be shocking but it doesn't really scare me. I'd say the kind of stuff that gets under my skin is the unknown. You hear a knock behind a wall and you don't know what it is. Is there something there or not?","I think that horror, in general, is fairly popular. It's definitely popular in film. There's just not a lot of good horror on TV, so whenever there is good horror on TV, people rush to it.","I don't know if I would say that I'm specifically a history buff. I do find a lot of things fascinating, especially anything that's bizarre or mysterious and unknown and we don't have all the answers for.","Even if you look at the 'Paranormal Activity' movies, at the end of the movie things get really crazy and nutty, but they all start in a very mundane situation that people can relate to, and that's also to some degree what we tried to do in 'Chernobyl Diaries.'","For a found-footage-style movie, there's a definite advantage in using unknowns, because it helps sell the illusion that it's real. A known actor would get in the way of the suspension of disbelief.","I'm just considering myself extremely lucky. All I wanted is to have 'Paranormal Activity' be released and become successful. And everything that's happened since then is just an enormous bonus.","I believe that whenever I want to learn something I can learn it much better and faster by myself if I'm motivated to learn it as opposed to kind of doing it in more a standard, institutionalized way.","I pay a lot of attention to box office because I understand it. TV ratings? I don't know how to interpret them, since I'm new to TV, so I'm just going to wait for somebody to tell me.","I think the tricky balance, the most important thing more than the horror is to have a compelling story, compelling drama, a show about great characters that you care about and you want to come back every week to see what they're up to.","Not knowing the thing that's chasing you is a lot scarier than seeing it right in front of you.","On 'Paranormal Activity,' it worked to my advantage not to have much of a crew, but on a bigger movie, where you have to work with a larger group of people who basically become your second family for a few months, it can be a great experience. Even though all of my projects are small scale compared to most Hollywood productions.","'Paranormal Activity' was a unique project in that I made it basically on my own, with a little help, and I had no exposure to the filmmaking world when I made it.","The thing that scares me is a place like the Amazon - which is the size of the continental U.S. and mostly unexplored and has a different ecosystem, there are so many things in there that can kill you.","One of the advantages of this found footage format is that you can have deliberately badly composed frames. Here we can put a camera in the weirdest angle and it kind of throws you off. You never know what you are supposed to be paying attention to. It's deliberate chaos.","The most pressure I felt was for the first 'Paranormal Activity,' because when it was released, whether it was going to be a hit or not, I knew it was going to be a life-altering event for me.","I feel like when you do things with such a small budget, it actually makes you be more creative... and allows you to concentrate more on the story and the characters. I think that there is something about dirty, gritty and raw filmmaking that makes it feel a little more natural and makes it easier to connect with the action.","Almost any movie, no matter how original, is borrowing from some other movies.","Don't know if I'm a nerd - I'm more of a geek.","I've never owned an Apple product. I like the fact that PCs are open architecture and not locked down like Apple products. I feel that Macs are also unjustifiably overpriced.","I'm pretty content with what I have, but the one thing that I don't have is something like the iPod - but PC-based. I think that would be cool.","In many cases your imagination is much more effective than what can be shown. It primes you to know something is about to happen - the anticipation and anxiety is worse than what ends up happening.","I think the traditional explanation is that demons just find someone, they pick on them and try to break down their spirit so they can... take control of their bodies. Why exactly? I don't know.","After I watched 'The Exorcist' I refused to watch any other movie that had anything to do with ghosts or demons. I didn't even watch 'Ghostbusters' until I was much older."],"Orhan Pamuk":["Life is short, and we should respect every moment of it.","A museum should not just be a place for fancy paintings but should be a place where we can communicate our lives through our everyday objects.","Museums are western inventions where the rich and the powerful or the government and the state tend to exhibit the signs and symbol and images of their culture.","Culture is mix. Culture means a mix of things from other sources. And my town, Istanbul, was this kind of mix. Istanbul, in fact, and my work, is a testimony to the fact that East and West combine cultural gracefully, or sometimes in an anarchic way, came together, and that is what we should search for.","Modernity means overabundance. We are living in the age of mass-produced objects, things that come without announcing themselves and end up on our tables, on our walls. We use them - most of us don't even notice them - and then they vanish without fanfare.","From a very young age, I suspected there was more to my world than I could see: somewhere in the streets of Istanbul, in a house resembling ours, there lived another Orhan so much like me he could pass for my twin, even my double.","For me, Westernization is not about consuming fanciful goods; it's about a system of free speech, democracy, egalitarianism and respect for the people's rights and dignity.","My hero wants to belong too, but he doesn't want to give up all the things he came to value in the west.","I always enjoy impersonating my characters in the first-person singular.","I wanted to tell a romantic and dark side of Ottoman history that was also slightly political, saying to the previous generation of writers, 'Look, I'm interested in Ottoman things, and I'm not afraid of it, and I'm doing something creative.'","I see Turkey's future as being in Europe, as one of many prosperous, tolerant, democratic countries.","One side of me is very busy paying attention to the details of life, the humanity of people, catching the street voices, the middle-class, upper-middle-class secret lives of Turks. The other side is interested in history and class and gender, trying to get all of society in a very realistic way.","'Snow' is my most popular book in the United States. But in Turkey, it was not as popular as 'My Name is Red,' or even 'The Museum of Innocence,' because the secular leaders didn't want this bourgeois Orhan trying to understand these head-scarf girls.","I came across humanity in Istanbul, and all I know about life comes from Istanbul, and definitely, I am writing about Istanbul. I also love the city because I live there, it has formed me, and it's me. Of course it is natural. If somebody lived all his life in Delhi, he will write about Delhi.","I don't look at emails, Internet or newspapers before 1 P.M. I wake at 7 A.M., eat fruit, drink tea or coffee, and read what I've achieved, or not achieved, the previous day. Then I take a shower and work on my next sentence until 1 P.M. After I've done emails and so on, I write again from 3 P.M. until 8 P.M.; then I socialise.","Idealism, unrealistic idealism, is always contrasted with the reality of the people, of the man in the street. The details of daily life are always more convincing than the political fantasies of the earlier generations.","Being a fiction writer makes you someone who works with irresponsibility.","Istanbul is a vast place. There are very conservative neighbourhoods, there are places that are upper class, Westernised, consuming Western culture.","The secularists in Turkey haven't underestimated religion, they just made the mistake of believing they could control it with the power of the army alone.","I consider myself Istanbul's storyteller. My subject matter is my town. I consider it my job to explore the hidden patterns of my city's clandestine corners, its shady, mysterious places, the things I love.","Generally, I get bad reviews in Turkey.","We fall in love more deeply when we're unhappy.","When people read a novel 600 pages long, six months pass, and all they will remember are five pages. They don't remember the text - instead, they remember the sensations the text gives them.","I write a world where everyone is partly right.","We should not judge Islam by terrorists. All civilizations and cultures produce terrorists. Every time there is a flag-burning, killing, or provocative films, I'm worried, not because something radical will happen, and this time, some people are killed. We're very sorry for that.","The writer's secret is not inspiration - for it is never clear where it comes from - it is his stubbornness, his patience.","I want to describe the psychological state of the people in a certain city.","Nothing can be as astounding as life. Except for writing. Yes, of course, except for writing, the sole consolation.","I really don't want to portray the Islamists as simply evil, the way it's often done in the west.","The hero of the book does long to experience God. But his conception of God is very western.","Well, on the one hand the Turks have the legitimate need to defend their national dignity - and this includes being recognized as a part of the west and Europe.","At first my publisher had reservations about publishing it in the form you are familiar with.","Good fiction is about asserting the beauties of the world, inventing a new, positive thing. Where am I going to get that? And it should be original; it should not be cliched. So the way I looked at history was not to accuse it of failure.","I have been attacked in Turkey more for my interviews than for my books. Political polemicists and columnists do not read novels there.","The habit of collecting, of attachment to things, is an essential human trait. But Western civilization put collecting on a pedestal by inventing museums. Museums are about representing power. It could be the king's power or, later, people's power.","When the whole world reads your books, is there any other happiness for a writer? I am happy that my books are read in 57 languages. But I am focused on Istanbul not because of Istanbul but because of humanity. Everyone is the same in the end.","These political movements flourish on the margins of Turkish society because of poverty and because of the people's feeling that they are not being represented.","First, I would find an object which I would think is suitable for my characters and stories, then write about it, and in the end, I ended up with a house full of thousands of objects.","The challenge is to lend conviction even to the voices which advocate views I find personally abhorrent, whether they are political Islamists or officers justifying a coup.","There's been quite a clear upswing in nationalist sentiments. Everyone is talking about it, in Turkey as well.","The opponents of this process have always tried to vilify westernization as a poor imitation.","I sometimes feel nervous because I give stupid answers to certain pointless questions. It happens in Turkish as much as in English. I speak bad Turkish and utter stupid sentences.","When I was publishing my first books, the previous generation of authors was fading away, so I was welcomed because I was a new author.","I have always thought that the place where you sleep or the place you share with your partner should be separate from the place where you write. The domestic rituals and details somehow kill the imagination. They kill the demon in me.","I don't judge my characters.","I think novelists should be disciplined and self-imposed working hours. I work a lot, but I don't feel that I'm working. I always feel that there is a child in me, healthy, and I'm playing.","When I write, I feel that I'm writing with my intellect. When I paint, I think it's some other force making me paint. I - as I wrote in my novel 'My Name is Red' - watch with amazement what my hand is doing on the paper, what kind of line, what kind of strange, beautiful thing it's doing in spite of my will, so to speak.","I believe in a world where there are no heroes, and I've read and know humanity a lot. There are moments that I admire in a person courage, intellect, hard work. These are the qualities I admire in an intellectual, in a writer, and there are so many people who have these things.","The truly great books are always novels: 'Anna Karenina,' 'The Brothers Karamazov,' 'The Magic Mountain.' Just as with 'Shahnameh,' I browse these books from time to time to remember how a great book works on us or to teach my students at Columbia University.","Just as good books give me the joys of being alive, bad novels depress me, and as I notice this sentiment coming from the pages, I stop. I also do not hesitate to walk out of a movie house if the film is bad.","Oscar Wilde always makes me smile - with respect and admiration. His short stories prove that it is possible to be both sarcastic, even cynical, but deeply compassionate. Just seeing the cover of one of Wilde's books in a bookshop makes me smile.","To appropriate an invention, be it artistic or technical, you have to have at least a part of your spirit embracing it so radically that you somehow change.","Self-hatred is OK. I have self-hatred, too. It's OK. What's bad is if you don't know how to get out of it, don't know how to manage it. Self-hatred is, in fact, a good thing if you can clearly see the mechanism of it, because it helps you to understand others.","People look at me as sort of a diplomat for Turkey, which by nature, I'm not; I don't want to be. It's again about that playfulness. Being Turkey's voice or representative is not playful, it's not childlike; it makes me self-conscious, kills the child in me.","I write because I have an innate need to. I write because I can't do normal work. I write because I want to read books like the ones I write. I write because I am angry at everyone. I write because I love sitting in a room all day writing. I write because I can partake of real life only by changing it.","At the age of 60, I am less experimental and more mature. I want most of all to convey my understanding of life.","I don't much care whether rural Anatolians or Istanbul secularists take power. I'm not close to any of them. What I care about is respect for the individual.","'The Museum of Innocence' is not about politics; it's a love story, but I think it's political in the sense that it wants to capture how a man suppresses a woman.","I don't like to make strong statements. I want to write strong novels... I keep my deep, radical things for my novels.","I wrote 'My Name is Red' just to remember painting, where the hand does it before the intellect. When I'm captive to it, I'm a happier person. Kierkegaard tells us that a happy person is someone who lives in the present; the unhappy person, someone who lives either in the past or the future.","When I paint, I definitely live in the present, like someone in a shower whistling or singing.","Authoritarianism, an unrealistic occidental imagination - these issues will never be settled. Turkey will continue to take Europe as a model; it will continue to pursue its search for democracy.","Novels are political because in them, we try to identify with people who are not like us. And, in that sense, I like the first-person singular because I have to imitate accurately the voice of someone who is not like me. The third-person singular gives me an authority over a character.","I strongly believe that the art of the novel works best when the writer identifies with whoever he or she is writing about. Novels in the end are based on the human capacity, compassion, and I can show more compassion to my characters if I write in a first person singular.","The fictive structure, my work, my imagination, my books are about the details, the huge construction about culture, Islamic culture or modern Turkey. They're all intertwined.","I think less than people think I do about politics. I care about writing.","The fueling of anti-Turkish sentiment in Europe is resulting in an anti-European, indiscriminate nationalism in Turkey.","Let us say in the pocket of one of my old coats I find a movie ticket from many years ago. Once I see the ticket, not only do I remember that I saw this movie, but also scenes from this movie, which I think I have entirely forgotten, come back to me. Objects have this power, and I like it.","I had the feeling that focusing on objects and telling a story through them would make my protagonists different from those in Western novels - more real, more quintessentially of Istanbul.","I get used to my fountain pens and my clothes, and I can never throw them away. I replace them only when I see that they are broken or embarrassing to wear.","Language is me, in a way. Really, I feel it.","I would be pleased if someone would invent a pill to remove my impatience, moodiness, and occasional bursts of anger. But if they did, I wouldn't be able to write my novels or paint.","My home is attached to a study - in fact, my home is my study, and I have a little room to sleep in. I need to write looking onto the street or a landscape. Looking at reality from some distance gives me romantic visions.","I have the legacy of my father and his nocturnal automatic waking up. But I like those periods. I immediately have a different vision of humanity and my life.","If a writer is to tell his own story - tell it slowly, and as if it were a story about other people - if he is to feel the power of the story rise up inside him, if he is to sit down at a table and patiently give himself over to this art - this craft - he must first have been given some hope.","If I think back on the books to which I have devoted my entire life, I am most surprised by those moments when I have felt as if the sentences, dreams, and pages that have made me so ecstatically happy have not come from my own imagination - that another power has found them and generously presented them to me."],"Ori Gersht":["Violence can be very grotesque and also intensely attractive. What interests me is how the two - beauty and violence - live side by side, and how moments can be created and erased almost simultaneously. Destruction is painful, but at times it can be very cathartic.","I had a dream of music and art and the big city in which I would get lost, where no one would know me and I wouldn't know anyone, where I would work at some ordinary job, and if one day I got up in the morning and decided I wasn't going to go to work anymore, no one would ask questions.","I look at life as a one-time opportunity, and you have to take pleasure in each moment, even if it is very problematic.","My work is not so much a direct commentary as it is an open-ended observation of the absurdities around us.","Consider the bloody history of Europe: there was a great aspiration for high culture, yet this very same culture was shaped by brutality and barbarism.","I'm constantly working on these edges of photography, either to employ so much information or reduce information to the point of collapse.","I have lived all my life as part of an ethnic conflict.","'Pomegranate,' started with my imagining a bullet going through the fruit and causing it to bleed. My initial associations were with pomegranates in old masters painting and their Judeo-Christian symbolism.","I worked a little as a messenger on a bicycle and then decided to study photography and film.","For a short time I was an assistant to a professional photographer, and I felt that my soul was not there. That is the stage when I decided to stay in London and do a graduate degree."],"Oriana Fallaci":["We must take positions. Our weakness in the West is born of the fact of so-called 'objectivity.' Objectivity does not exist - it cannot exist!... The word is a hypocrisy which is sustained by the lie that the truth stays in the middle. No, sir: Sometimes truth stays on one side only.","I am known for a life spent in the struggle for freedom, and freedom includes the freedom of religion.","It must be terribly lonely to be a king instead of a man.","I am an atheist, and if an atheist and a pope think the same things, there must be something true. It's that simple!","The moment you give up your principles, and your values, you are dead, your culture is dead, your civilization is dead. Period.","Europe is no longer Europe, it is Eurabia, a colony of Islam, where the Islamic invasion does not proceed only in a physical sense, but also in a mental and cultural sense.","What are the symbols of American strength, wealth, power and modernity? Certainly not jazz and rock and roll, not chewing-gum or hamburgers, Broadway or Hollywood. It's their skyscrapers. Their Pentagon. Their science. Their technology.","Without Khomeini, we would not be where we are. What a pity that, when pregnant with him, his mother did not choose to have an abortion.","Is it right to shoot the poor prostitute or a woman who is unfaithful to her husband, or a man who loves another man?","Alas, nothing reveals man the way war does. Nothing so accentuates in him the beauty and ugliness, the intelligence and foolishness, the brutishness and humanity, the courage and cowardice, the enigma.","I find it shameful that in nearly all the universities of Europe, Palestinian students sponsor and nurture anti-Semitism.","I am disgusted by the anti-Semitism of many Italians, of many Europeans.","I have reached the conclusion that those who have physical courage also have moral courage. Physical courage is a great test.","I don't hide. I never have. I stay at home because I like to stay at home, and at home I work.","Wojtyla was a warrior, who did more to end the Soviet Union than even America.","I have always looked on disobedience toward the oppressive as the only way to use the miracle of having been born.","War is something Arafat sends others to do for him. That is, the poor souls who believe in him. This pompous incompetent caused the failure of the Camp David negotiations, Clinton's mediation.","I didn't want to kill a man. I'm not capable of killing a man. I wanted to kill a tyrant.","I am a danger to myself if I get angry.","When you have been born in a war like me, living in a war as a child, when you have been in wars as a war correspondent all your life - trust me! You develop a form of fatalism; you are always ready to die.","Laura Bush has the face of my mother when my mother was young. The face, the body, the voice. The first time I saw on TV Laura Bush, I got frozen because it was as if my mother was not dead. 'Oh, Mama,' I said, 'Mama.'","America's vulnerability comes precisely from its strength, its wealth, its power and its modernity. It's the usual story of the dog chasing its own tail.","I love soldiers. They are my kids, they are my children.","I've always disliked kamikazes, that is, people who commit suicide in order to kill others. Starting with the Japanese ones from World War II. I never considered them Pietro Miccas who torch the powder and go up with the citadel in order to block the arrival of the enemy troops at Torino. I never considered them soldiers.","My soldier weapon is the weapon of truth.","The Muslims refuse our culture and try to impose their culture on us. I reject them, and this is not only my duty toward my culture-it is toward my values, my principles, my civilization.","Have you ever thought that war is a madhouse and that everyone in the war is a patient?","You cannot survive if you do not know the past.","You cannot govern, you cannot administrate, with an ignoramus.","Why do the people humiliate themselves by voting? I didn't vote because I have dignity. If I had closed my nose and voted for one of them, I would spit on my own face.","Whether it comes from a despotic sovereign or an elected president, from a murderous general or a beloved leader, I see power as an inhuman and hateful phenomenon.","When my father was arrested, we didn't know where they had him. My mother found him at the house of torture. It was called Villa Triste.","We are an age without leaders. We stopped having leaders at the end of the 20th century.","This Islam business kidnapped me.","The increased presence of Muslims in Italy and in Europe is directly proportional to our loss of freedom.","Khomeini was not a puppet like Arafat or Qaddafi or the many other dictators I met in the Islamic world. He was a sort of Pope, a sort of king - a real leader.","I was a little girl fighting as a partisan against Nazi-Fascism.","I feel less alone when I read the books of Ratzinger.","I don't want to hear about my death.","I defend Israel's right to exist, to defend themselves, to not let themselves be exterminated a second time.","I cry, sometimes, because I'm not 20 years younger, and I'm not healthy. But if I were, I would even sacrifice my writing to enter politics.","How do you dare to ask me for a solution? It's like asking Seneca for a solution. You remember what he did? He committed suicide!","Heroes can be sweet.","Glory is a heavy burden, a murdering poison, and to bear it is an art. And to have that art is rare.","Arafat contradicts himself every five minutes. He always plays the double-cross, lies even if you ask him what time it is.","I no longer have the energy to get really angry, like I used to.","I have expressed my opinion through the written word through my books, that is all.","You cannot work and be at home with your child. But you want both.","To speak of oneself means to lay bare one's own soul, expose it like a body to the sun. To lay bare one's own soul is not at all like taking off one's brassiere on a crowded beach!","I have never met a man more shy than Clark Gable. He was so shy, you couldn't make him talk.","The more democratic and open a society is, the more it's exposed to terrorism. The more a country is free, not governed by a police regime, the more it risks hijackings or massacres like the ones that took place for many years in Italy and Germany and other parts of Europe.","I know I am a writer; it is the only thing I am sure of.","The most humiliating thing a woman can be is a coquette.","I must admit that I am not generous with weak people. It's not in my nature or in my personality. My parents were not generous with weak people, see?","It is the mainspring of life, courage. And courage has many faces.","The larger truth, the universal truth that you can give in a novel, is far greater than what you can give through journalism.","A civilization, a culture, cannot survive without passion, cannot be saved without passion."],"Origen":["The power of choosing good and evil is within the reach of all.","Now the true soldiers of Christ must always be prepared to do battle for the truth, and must never, so far as lies with them, allow false convictions to creep in.","This opinion, however, is held by most, that the devil was an angel, and that, having become an apostate, he induced as many of the angels as possible to fall away with himself, and these up to the present time are called his angels.","When Jesus then is with the multitudes, He is not in His house, for the multitudes are outside of the house, and it is an act which springs from His love of men to leave the house and to go away to those who are not able to come to Him.","When a house is being built which is to be made as strong as possible, the building takes place in fine weather and in calm, so that nothing may hinder the structure from acquiring the needed solidity.","But Paul, in his preaching of the Gospel, is a debtor to deliver the word not to Barbarians only, but also to Greeks, and not only to the unwise, who would easily agree with him, but also to the wise.","For if the mystery concealed of old is made manifest to the Apostles through the prophetic writings, and if the prophets, being wise men, understood what proceeded from their own mouths, then the prophets knew what was made manifest to the Apostles.","Now our whole activity is devoted to God, and our whole life, since we are bent on progress in divine things.","This also is a part of the Church's teaching, that the world was made and took its beginning at a certain time, and is to be destroyed on account of its wickedness.","This also is a part of the teaching of the Church, that there are certain angels of God, and certain good influences, which are His servants in accomplishing the salvation of men.","Having refuted, then, as well as we could, every notion which might suggest that we were to think of God as in any degree corporeal, we go on to say that, according to strict truth, God is incomprehensible, and incapable of being measured.","For whatever be the knowledge which we are able to obtain of God, either by perception or reflection, we must of necessity believe that He is by many degrees far better than what we perceive Him to be.","But God, who is the beginning of all things, is not to be regarded as a composite being, lest perchance there should be found to exist elements prior to the beginning itself, out of which everything is composed, whatever that be which is called composite.","But the Wisdom of God, which is His only-begotten Son, being in all respects incapable of change or alteration, and every good quality in Him being essential, and such as cannot be changed and converted, His glory is therefore declared to be pure and sincere.","Then, in the next place, we must know that every being which is endowed with reason, and transgresses its statutes and limitations, is undoubtedly involved in sin by swerving from rectitude and justice.","We are obliged, therefore, to say that whoever speaks that which is foreign to religion is using many words, while he who speaks the words of truth, even should he go over the whole field and omit nothing, is always speaking the one word.","We must believe what is good and true about the prophets, that they were sages, that they did understand what proceeded from their mouths, and that they bore prudence on their lips.","If all things were made through Him, clearly so must the splendid revelations have been which were made to the fathers and prophets, and became to them the symbols of the sacred mysteries of religion.","The physical voice we use in prayer need not be great nor startling; even should we not lift up any great cry or shout, God will yet hear us.","To him who, though by no means near the end, is yet advancing, He is the way; to him who has put off all that is dead He is the life."],"Orison Swett Marden":["There can be no failure to a man who has not lost his courage, his character, his self respect, or his self-confidence.

Weak men wait for opportunities; strong men make them.","We make the world we live in and shape our own environment.","Do not waste time dreaming of great faraway opportunities; do the best you can where you are. Open your petals of power and beauty and fling out the fragrance of your life in the place that has been assigned to you.","It is the hopeful, buoyant, cheerful attitude of mind that wins. Optimism is a success builder; pessimism an achievement killer.","Success is not measured by what you accomplish, but by the opposition you have encountered, and the courage with which you have maintained the struggle against overwhelming odds.","A will finds a way.","The golden rule for every business man is this: 'Put yourself in your customer's place.'","Forests, lakes, and rivers, clouds and winds, stars and flowers, stupendous glaciers and crystal snowflakes - every form of animate or inanimate existence, leaves its impress upon the soul of man.","Nothing else so destroys the power to stand alone as the habit of leaning upon others. If you lean, you will never be strong or original. Stand alone or bury your ambition to be somebody in the world.","We must give more in order to get more. It is the generous giving of ourselves that produces the generous harvest.","The man who practises unselfishness, who is genuinely interested in the welfare of others, who feels it a privilege to have the power to do a fellow-creature a kindness - even though polished manners and a gracious presence may be absent - will be an elevating influence wherever he goes.","There is inestimable blessing in a cheerful spirit. When the soul throws its windows wide open, letting in the sunshine, and presenting to all who see it the evidence of its gladness, it is not only happy, but it has an unspeakable power of doing good.","Those who have accomplished great things in the world have been, as a rule, bold, aggressive, and self-confident. They dared to step out from the crowd and act in an original way. They were not afraid to be generals.","Sweeter than the perfume of roses is a reputation for a kind, charitable, unselfish nature; a ready disposition to do to others any good turn in your power.","Our thoughts and imagination are the only real limits to our possibilities.","There is no medicine like hope, no incentive so great, and no tonic so powerful as expectation of something tomorrow.","One of the greatest boons that can ever come to a human being is to be born on a farm and reared in the country. Self-reliance and grit are oftenest country-bred.","A strong, successful man is not the victim of his environment. He creates favorable conditions. His own inherent force and energy compel things to turn out as he desires.","Live in the very soul of expectation of better things, in the conviction that something large, grand, and beautiful will await you if your efforts are intelligent, if your mind is kept in a creative condition and you struggle upward to your goal.","Your outlook upon life, your estimate of yourself, your estimate of your value are largely colored by your environment. Your whole career will be modified, shaped, molded by your surroundings, by the character of the people with whom you come in contact every day.","One can make no better investment than the cultivation of a taste for the beautiful, for it will bring rainbow hues and enduring joys to the whole life. It will not only greatly increase one's capacity for happiness, but also one's efficiency.","Every young man or woman should weigh the matter well before concluding that a college education is out of the question.","All men who have achieved great things have been great dreamers.","Joyfulness keeps the heart and face young. A good laugh makes us better friends with ourselves and everybody around us.","Discouragement, fear, doubt, lack of self-confidence, are the germs which have killed the prosperity and happiness of tens of thousands of people.","Whatever you do, don't discourage your dreaming propensity. Your heart's desires are not empty vaporings. They foreshadow possible realities. Man was made to aspire, to look upward.","Our trials, our sorrows, and our grieves develop us.","There is an infinite difference between a little wrong and just right, between fairly good and the best, between mediocrity and superiority.","Circumstances have rarely favored great men. A lowly beginning is no bar to a great career. The boy who works his way through college may have a hard time of it, but he will learn how to work his way in life, and will usually take higher rank in school and in after life than his classmate who is the son of a millionaire.","No one can make the most of himself until he looks upon his life as a magnificent possibility, the materials for a great masterpiece, to mar or spoil which would be a great tragedy.","He who improves an opportunity sows a seed which will yield fruit in opportunity for himself and others.","With five chances on each hand and one unwavering aim, no boy, however poor, need despair. There is bread and success for every youth under the American flag who has energy and ability to seize his opportunity.","It is psychological law that whatever we desire to accomplish we must impress upon the subjective or subconscious mind.","If our dreams are sincere desires to achieve, not mere pipe-dreams, there is something deep within ourselves which comes out to meet them and helps to make them realities.","Success is the child of drudgery and perseverance. It cannot be coaxed or bribed; pay the price and it is yours.","Obstacles are like wild animals. They are cowards but they will bluff you if they can. If they see you are afraid of them... they are liable to spring upon you; but if you look them squarely in the eye, they will slink out of sight.","The great thing in life is efficiency. If you amount to anything in the world, your time is valuable, your energy precious. They are your success capital, and you cannot afford to heedlessly throw them away or trifle with them.","When we are sure that we are on the right road there is no need to plan our journey too far ahead. No need to burden ourselves with doubts and fears as to the obstacles that may bar our progress. We cannot take more than one step at a time.","One of the secrets of a successful life is to be able to hold all of our energies upon one point, to focus all of the scattered rays of the mind upon one place or thing.","It is like the seed put in the soil - the more one sows, the greater the harvest.","Wanted: a man who will not lose his individuality in a crowd, a man who has the courage of his convictions, who is not afraid to say 'No,' though all the world say 'Yes.'","Do not give up your dream because it is apparently not being realized, because you cannot see it coming true. Cling to your vision with all the tenacity you can muster. Keep it bright; do not let the bread-and-butter side of life cloud your ideal or dim it.","Regard every suggestion that your life may be a failure, that you are not made like those who succeed, and that success is not for you, as a traitor, and expel it from your mind as you would a thief from your house.","It is the idle man, not the great worker, who is always complaining that he has no time or opportunity.","No employer today is independent of those about him. He cannot succeed alone, no matter how great his ability or capital. Business today is more than ever a question of cooperation.","Put the uncommon effort into the common task... make it large by doing it in a great way.","Achievement is not always success, while reputed failure often is. It is honest endeavor, persistent effort to do the best possible under any and all circumstances.","Open eyes will discover opportunities everywhere; open ears will never fail to detect the cries of those who are perishing for assistance; open hearts will never want for worthy objects upon which to bestow their gifts; open hands will never lack for noble work to do.","The influential man is the successful man, whether he be rich or poor.","The quality of your work, in the long run, is the deciding factor on how much your services are valued by the world.","When we begin to desire a thing, to yearn for it with all our hearts, we begin to establish relationship with it in proportion to the strength and persistency of our longing and intelligent effort to realize it.","Every man must play the part of his ambition. If you are trying to be a successful man, you must play the part.","There is no investment you can make which will pay you so well as the effort to scatter sunshine and good cheer through your establishment.","All who have accomplished great things have had a great aim, have fixed their gaze on a goal which was high, one which sometimes seemed impossible.","No one is mocked with the yearning for that which he has no ability to attain. If he holds the right mental attitude and struggles earnestly, honestly toward his goal, he will reach it, or at least approximate to it.","Our visions are the plans of the possible life structure, but they will end in plans if we do not follow them up with a vigorous effort to make them real, just as the architect's plans will end in his drawings if they are not followed up and made real by the builder.","Character is the indelible mark that determines the only true value of all people and all their work.","The golden opportunity you are seeking is in yourself. It is not in your environment; it is not in luck or chance, or the help of others; it is in yourself alone.","Analyzing what you haven't got as well as what you have is a necessary ingredient of a career.","No man can be ideally successful until he has found his place. Like a locomotive he is strong on the track, but weak anywhere else.","No matter where your lot may be cast, no power on earth can keep you from making a man of yourself, a superb character, a masterpiece.","Just try the effect of putting beauty into your life, a little every day. You will find it magical. It will broaden and light up your outlook upon the world as the acquisition of money or fame never can.","Every youth owes it to himself and to the world to make the most possible out of the stuff that is in him.","The size of your accomplishments, the quality of your achievement, will depend very largely on how big a man you see in yourself, what sort of image you get of your possible self, yourself at your best.","Scatter your flowers as you go; you will never go this way again.","Our destiny changes with our thought; we shall become what we wish to become, do what we wish to do, when our habitual thought corresponds with our desire.","If you do not feel yourself growing in your work and your life broadening and deepening, if your task is not a perpetual tonic to you, you have not found your place.","What is enthusiasm but a passionate belief in what seems to be a high and holy aim - an unselfish devotion to some noble cause - a consecration of heart and mind and soul to the attainment of a great object?","Our dreaming capacity gives us a peep into the glorious realities that await us further on. It is the evidence of things possible to us.","The forthputting of willpower is a means of strengthening willpower. The will becomes strong by exercise. To stick to a thing till you are master is a test of intellectual discipline and power.","No man can stand still; the moment progress is not made, retrogression begins. If the blade is not kept sharp and bright, the law of rust will assert its claim.","Nearly all the great improvements, discoveries, inventions, and achievements which have elevated and blessed humanity have been the triumphs of enthusiasm.","Most of our obstacles would melt away if, instead of cowering before them, we should make up our minds to walk boldly through them.","There is only one thing for us to do, and that is to do our level best right where we are every day of our lives; To use our best judgment, and then to trust the rest to that Power which holds the forces of the universe in his hands.","True economy means the wisest expenditure of what we have, everything considered, looking at it from the broadest standpoint. It is not a good thing to save a nickel at the expenditure of twenty-five cents' worth of time.","No man fails who does his best.","Be larger than your task.","There is no stimulus like that which comes from the consciousness of knowing that others believe in us.","The Creator has not given you a longing to do that which you have no ability to do.","Many a man has finally succeeded only because he has failed after repeated efforts. If he had never met defeat he would never have known any great victory.","What power can poverty have over a home where loving hearts are beating with a consciousness of untold riches of the head and heart?","A constant struggle, a ceaseless battle to bring success from inhospitable surroundings, is the price of all great achievements.","The hand cannot reach higher than does the heart.","I wish I could fill every young man who reads these pages with an utter dread and horror of poverty. I wish I could make you so feel its shame, its constraint, its bitterness that you would make vows against it.","Without this tremendous passion for power, influence, and advantage which money gives, how could nature develop the highest type of man? Without this infinite longing, whence would come the discipline which industry, perseverance, tact, sagacity, and frugality give?","The most fascinating person is always the one of the most winning manners; not the one of greatest physical beauty.","Every man ultimately falls into the company with which he affiliates. And he is the strongest who draws men to himself, who creates the company; and this is through having a positive quality - courage and physical prowess.","When God calls a man to be upright and pure and generous, he also calls him to be intelligent and skillful, and strong and brave.","It is just as important to set apart time for the development of our aesthetic faculties as for cultivating the money-getting instinct. A man cannot live by bread alone. His higher life demands an impalpable food.","If you would make the most of yourself, never picture yourself as anything different from what you would actually be, the man or woman you long to become.","If you would make the most of yourself, cut away all of your vitality sappers; get rid of everything which hampers you and holds you back, everything which wastes your energy, cuts down your working capital. Get freedom at any cost.","Work faithfully, and you will put yourself in possession of a glorious and enlarging happiness.","The achievements of willpower are almost beyond computation. Scarcely anything seems impossible to the man who can will strongly enough and long enough.","The world takes us at our own valuation. It believes in the man who believes in himself, but it has little use for the timid man: the one who is never certain of himself, who cannot rely on his own judgment, who craves advice from others, and is afraid to go ahead on his own account.","The true doctrine is that labor - systematic, effective, congenial labor - is not only a necessity, but is the source of the highest enjoyment.","There are powers inside of you which, if you could discover and use, would make of you everything you ever dreamed or imagined you could become.","A good system shortens the road to the goal.","The great aim of your life should be to keep your powers up to the highest possible standard, to so conserve your energies, guard your health, that you can make every occasion a great occasion.","One should live between extravagance and meanness. Don't save money by starving your mind. It is false economy never to take a holiday, or never to spend money for an evening's amusement or for a useful book.","The man who would forge to the front in this competitive age must be a man of prompt and determined decision.","Never allow yourself to dwell upon your weaknesses, deficiencies, or failures. Holding firmly the ideal and struggling vigorously to attain it will help you to realize it.","The greatest thing a man can do in this world is to make the most possible out of the stuff that has been given him. This is success, and there is no other.","We fail to see that we can control our destiny; make ourselves do whatever is possible; make ourselves become whatever we long to be.","You cannot measure a man by his failures. You must know what use he makes of them. What did they mean to him. What did he get out of them.","The Universe is one great kindergarten for man. Everything that exists has brought with it its own peculiar lesson.","To many a man, and sometimes to a youth, there comes the opportunity to choose between honorable competence and tainted wealth. The young man who starts out to be poor and honorable, holds in his hand one of the strongest elements of success.","It is what we do easily and what we like to do that we do well.","The man who has no money is poor, but one who has nothing but money is poorer. He only is rich who can enjoy without owning; he is poor who though he has millions is covetous.","You have not found your place until all your faculties are roused, and your whole nature consents and approves of the work you are doing.","You will never succeed while smarting under the drudgery of your occupation, if you are constantly haunted with the idea that you could succeed better in something else.","There can be no great courage where there is no confidence or assurance, and half the battle is in the conviction that we can do what we undertake.","We advance on our journey only when we face our goal, when we are confident and believe we are going to win out.","Your expectations opens or closes the doors of your supply, If you expect grand things, and work honestly for them, they will come to you, your supply will correspond with your expectation.","The best thing about giving of ourselves is that what we get is always better than what we give. The reaction is greater than the action.","Deep within man dwell those slumbering powers; powers that would astonish him, that he never dreamed of possessing; forces that would revolutionize his life if aroused and put into action.","Power gravitates to the man who knows how.","Unless you have prepared yourself to profit by your chance, the opportunity will only make you ridiculous. A great occasion is valuable to you just in proportion as you have educated yourself to make use of it.","No one has a corner on success. It is his who pays the price.","Wisdom is knowledge which has become a part of one's being.","The waste of life occasioned by trying to do too many things at once is appalling.","The most irresistible charm of youth is its bubbling enthusiasm. Youth sees no darkness ahead - no defile that has no outlet - it forgets that there is such a thing as failure in the world and believes that mankind has been waiting all these centuries for him to come and be the liberator of truth and energy and beauty.","If a thing seems to you worth working for at all, if it appears to you of moment enough to challenge any effort, then put into what you do all the enthusiasm of which you are capable, regardless of criticism.","Enthusiasm will steady the heart and strengthen the will; it will give force to the thought and nerve to the hand until what was only a possibility becomes a reality.","Everybody is struggling for the good things of the world, and all the arguments to prove that they are not desirable are worse than wasted.","More men are ruined by underestimating the value of money than by overestimating it. Let us, then, abandon the affectation of despising money, and frankly own its value.","History furnishes thousands of examples of men who have seized occasions to accomplish results deemed impossible by those less resolute. Prompt decision and whole-souled action sweep the world before them.","Existence is the privilege of effort, and when that privilege is met like a man, opportunities to succeed along the line of your aptitude will come faster than you can use them.","Golden opportunities are nothing to laziness, but industry makes the commonest chances golden.","Wanted: a man who is larger than his calling, who considers it a low estimate of his occupation to value it merely as a means of getting a living.","The sort of man you will make of yourself, how you will be regarded by the world, whether people will admire and respect or despise you, whether you win the approval or the condemnation of your Maker - all this is in your own hands.","Life is a great university for the unfolding of the mind, for developing character. In choosing our life work, when we are free to choose, we should remember this, and choose that which will call the biggest man or woman out of us and not that from which we can coin the most dollars.","What we do for a living does not matter so much as how we do it. It is the spirit in which we do our work that counts, and that counts through all eternity.","Nothing that the mind of man can conceive is impossible.","The great opportunity belongs to him who can see it, to him who can grasp it. The better part of your chance is right inside of you.","Many a man owes his advancement very largely to his ability to converse well. The ability to interest people in your conversation, to hold them, is a great power.","If you are ambitious to talk well, you must be as much as possible in the society of well-bred, cultured people. If you seclude yourself, though you are a college graduate, you will be a poor converser.","Put variety into your mental bill of fare as well as into your physical. It will pay you rich returns.","He has missed the finest lesson of culture and experience who has not learned how to enjoy without owning.","Charm of personality is a divine gift that sways the strongest characters and sometimes even controls the destinies of nations.","It pays to cultivate popularity. It doubles success possibilities, develops manhood, and builds up character.","The ability to cultivate friends is a powerful aid to success. It is capital which will stand by one when panics come, when banks fail, when business concerns go to the wall.","Necessity has been a priceless spur which has helped men to perform miracles against incredible odds.","There is not a single indication in man's wonderful mechanism that he was created for a life of poverty. There is something larger and grander for him in the divine plan than perpetual slavery to the bread-winning problem.","The mere fact that so many continue to rise, year after year, out of just such conditions as you may think are fatal to your advancement, ought to convince you that you also can conquer your environment.","Poverty itself is not so bad as the poverty thought. It is the conviction that we are poor and must remain so that is fatal.","If you would attract good fortune, you must get rid of doubt. As long as that stands between you and your ambition, it will be a bar that will cut you off. You must have faith. No man can make a fortune while he is convinced that he can't.","There is nothing in this world which men desire and struggle for, and that is good for them, of which there is not enough for everybody.","If we hold the poverty thought, the penury thought, the thought of lack, we cannot demonstrate abundance. We must hold the plenty thought if we would reach plenty.","Unless generosity of spirit prevails among men, there can never be upon earth an ideal life.","By constant contemplation of excellence, we clear our selfhood of all dross and impurities.","When the sacredness of one's word is matched in the attributes of his character throughout, all that constitutes a man, then we find that there is something in a man's life greater than his occupation or his achievements; grander than acquisition or wealth; higher than genius; more enduring than fame.","He is the richest man who enriches his country most; in whom the people feel richest and proudest; who gives himself with his money; who opens the doors of opportunity widest to those about him; who is ears to the deaf, eyes to the blind, and feet to the lame.","Whoever uplifts civilization is rich though he die penniless, and future generations will erect his monument.","In order to keep himself at the top of his condition, to obtain complete mastery of all his powers and possibilities, a man must be good to himself mentally; he must think well of himself.","It is every one's sacred duty to keep himself in a condition to do the biggest thing possible to him.","Most of us are at war with ourselves, are our own worst enemies. We expect a great deal of ourselves, yet we do not put ourselves in a condition to achieve great things. We are either too indulgent to our bodies, or we are not indulgent enough.","Economize in other things if you must, wear threadbare clothes if necessary, but never cheat your body or brain by the quality and quantity of your food. Poor, cheap food which produces low vitality and inferior brain force is the worst kind of economy.","A day of worry is more exhausting than a week of work. Worry upsets our whole system; work keeps it in health and order.","Form the habit early in life of leaving your business at the store or wherever you may be employed. Never carry it home to mar the peace of your family; if you do, you will soon drive out the sunshine.","Should you be so unfortunate as to suppose you are a genius, and that 'things will come to you,' it would be well to undeceive yourself as soon as possible. Make up your mind that industry must be the price of all you obtain, and at once begin to pay down.","The secret of success lies in that old word, 'Drudgery,' in doing one thing long after it ceases to be amusing; and it is 'this one thing I do' that gathers me together from my chaos, that concentrates me from possibilities to powers, and turns powers into achievements.","There is no surer token of a little mind than to imagine that anything in the way of physical labor is dishonoring.","What is needed by him who would succeed in the highest degree possible is careful planning. He is to accumulate reserved power, that he may be equal to all emergencies.","You are never to allow a shadow of doubt to enter your mind that the Creator intended you to win in life's battle.","Strength of will is the test of a young man's possibilities. Can he will strong enough and hold whatever he undertakes with an iron grip?","When the mind has once formed the habit of holding cheerful, happy, prosperous pictures, it will not be easy to form the opposite habit.","Believe with all your heart that you will do what you were made to do. Never for an instant harbor a doubt of it.","We are all the products of our own thoughts. Whatever we concentrate upon, that we are."],"Orla Brady":["Mum asks why I am so often cast in adulterous roles. I think it must be because I am fairly flirty.","Everyone knew I was anti-marriage. I'd spent my life saying it was something I neither wanted nor needed.","Girls pour their insecurities into their looks.","If I saw my 15-year-old self now, I'd think I wasn't that bad, but back then I perceived myself as awful.","I went to Paris for a year in 1986 to study theatre; there was a lot of clowning around, buffoonery and fencing. It was then that my own style kind of blossomed.","I was a bit overweight as a teenager, which may be why I'm more comfortable playing with clothes than showing my body.","Clothes are interesting and they're there to be played with. I like the idea of costume rather than fashion.","Why not just have fun with clothes? We should be more light-hearted about how we dress, how we look. If you experiment, you can go wrong, clearly; but you can have a wonderful time doing it!"],"Orlando Aloysius Battista":["An error doesn't become a mistake until you refuse to correct it.","The best inheritance a parent can give his children is a few minutes of his time each day.","The greatest weakness of most humans is their hesitancy to tell others how much they love them while they're alive.","The fellow who says he'll meet you halfway usually thinks he's standing on the dividing line.","One of the most lasting pleasures you can experience is the feeling that comes over you when you genuinely forgive an enemy - whether he knows it or not.","Temptations, unlike opportunities, will always give you many second chances."],"Orlando Bloom":["I just want to have a nice, happy life.","The best way to look stylish on a budget is to try second-hand, bargain hunting, and vintage.","People think getting a new partner is like getting a new car.","Being a gentleman is a worthy goal.","Life is about balance, and we all have to make the effort in areas that we can to enable us to make a difference.","As a child, I was always drawn to heroic characters. I decided I wanted to act when I realised that Superman and all those gangsters and Indians were just real people in costume.","I am a hopeless romantic and I love to spoil my girlfriends.","It takes obstacles to learn, grow, be better.","I wondered how they would top the Pirates and skeletons and moonlight, because that's a pretty cool concept.","When you start to live your dream, it's not quite what you thought it was because there is a lot of overwhelming stuff that comes on top of it, and you have to figure it all out.","Elves have this superhuman strength, yet they're so graceful. Tolkien created them to be angelic spirits, but I also saw Legolas as something out of the Seven Samurai.","My first priority is trying to protect my family.","As an actor, you can't think about the end result or the fame; you just have to focus on the day you're in. You have no control over the finished product, what people will think of it, so all you have is the experience of making it, and you have to stay focused on that.","Having people jumping in front of you taking a photo can be unnerving.","There's a difference between a failure and a fiasco... a fiasco is a disaster of mythic proportions.","Being referred to as a hunk or a heartthrob makes me nervous, but it's flattering. But I'm more interested in being an actor than a heartthrob.","If life isn't about human beings and living in harmony, then I don't know what it's about.","I came back out here from England and I was there for a while and it was beautiful and it is just great to see London going from Spring to Summer and Autumn.","Legolas in 'Lord Of The Rings' was sent as a bridge from his people into the world of dwarves and humans and wizards and everything else.","I'm looking at doing things that challenge me.","My cousin once told me, 'You're tall, you're handsome - and you're gonna have to apologize for it the rest of your life.' He imparted that information to me.","Elves live in harmony with the world, and I try to do that.","Elves are like trees, grounded and focused from the trunk down but graceful and agile on top.","I generally travel with my laptop, a couple of great books, and my iPod.","Watch how you communicate with a woman. Because you're always communicating, even when you're not talking - with your body language, your facial expressions, your eyes.","I have flown with British Airways since I was a very little child, so it feels quite special to have gone from family holidays flying around Europe to become a gold card holder and be spoiled enough to travel more than not in first class.","Every stylish man should have a copy of 'The Fountainhead' by Ayn Rand on his bookshelf.","Wear comfortable clothes when you fly; my preference is T-shirt and jeans.","When I finished the trilogy of 'Pirates of the Caribbean' movies, I had a gear shift and thought, 'I need to take a moment to smell the roses.'","I don't want to be a pretty boy.","Elves are cool, man.","I missed my home - like the physicality of my home, I missed my friends and my family mostly and just hanging out and being in your home country - culturally it feels right and that is what I miss.","I'm trying to mix the cool, independent stuff with the big stuff, but it's been difficult finding the right roles. It's been an interesting ride as far as my career pendulum is concerned.","Someone tried to save my soul in a gas station.","People come into your life and people leave it... you just have to trust that life has a road mapped out for you.","When you start falling for somebody and you can't stop thinking about when you're going to see them again, I love that. Women are beautiful. They deserve to be cherished and respected.","I'm quite sensitive to women. I saw how my sister got treated by boyfriends. I read this thing that said when you are in a relationship with a woman, imagine how you would feel if you were her father. That's been my approach, for the most part.","The role of an actor is to make every character believable.","Be comfortable. I think if you're comfortable, you exude confidence, and that leads to good style.","When I was prepping for my Broadway debut as Romeo, it really hit me that I had never done that. I had trained at drama school for three years in my late teens to early 20s, and I'd studied Shakespeare, of course, but I hadn't actually performed it. So to do something like Romeo for my first Broadway role was a challenge.","When you're young and you're in love and it doesn't work out - it hurts.","Success can allow you to try for greatness, can give you an opportunity to take a chance on something. I'm very blessed to have the success that I've had, and that's given me so many opportunities to work on being great.","I have a personal little routine that I do in my dressing room just to kind of get myself mentally prepared to go on stage, and part of that is a poem that I read to myself.","Take time to enjoy the flight - read a good book, watch a film, catch up on emails and sleep.","Think about finding out when you're 13 that your dad is not your dad. It's like, okay, take it on the chin and keep going. No choice, really.","I have played a boxer, a cowboy, a knight, a prince, an elf and a pirate. I am so glad to have done all of that already.","There's a whole element of human interaction and character interaction that I really enjoy doing.","I don't buy art to put away somewhere. I buy art to appreciate, enjoy, and live with. It's supposed to add to your life.","I love traditions. I mean, cultural ones.","I got to dress up in funny clothes and run around New Zealand with a bow and arrow for 18 months, how bad could that be?","A big part of what I wanted to do with this character was go from when I was a boy and try and develop into a man, really try and play him as a man who is on this search, on a journey of personal, spiritual, political, social discovery.","I crave working on those small independent movies because I love going to see those myself.","I don't do a film unless it has a sword in it. And if it doesn't have a sword in it, I insist that they have one in the same room to keep me comfortable.","I got to work with one of my heroes, Johnny Depp, and to see how he goes about business, which was really inspiring for me at this stage in my career.","I had studied theater for three years in London when someone suggested me for the role.","I had the training at drama school where I studied Shakespeare and Brecht and Chekov and all these period historical playwrights and I think that I responded to the material.","I think a film set is a quite controlled environment and you feel like you can trust them and it is going to be a safe place to work, but I really don't think about it.","I think it's sort of a rite of passage for a British actor to try and get the American accent and have a good crack at doing that.","I try to take the time to appreciate and I certainly do appreciate and I do feel proud but that is probably one of the things I need to work on, building a bit of time for myself.","I'm so happy to have been a part of that process and I would go straight back into the desert in a ton of chain mail for Ridley any day of the week. He's an amazing director and I can't wait to see the long version.","Lord of the Rings was my first experience making movies and at the time, I had no ideas how movies were done. I thought that's the way they're done, so in a way, I had nothing to compare it to.","My whole career has been fulfilling my childhood fantasies, playing characters that are larger than life, getting to play a knight, an elf, a prince, and a soldier.","Obviously I always wanted to do a contemporary piece.","The truth is - I found myself doing these huge action-adventure movies, and um, and which are cool man. And I really love doing them. And thankfully I haven't had too much dialogue, because if I had I would have really made a mess of it. You know what I mean?","When everyone around you is doing all this incredible pirate acting and you're having to sort of play the straight guy and move the story forward, you kind of want to be doing some of that pirate ripping it up stuff, but in truth, to be a part of that project is what I love.","When I saw the first I couldn't believe I was in another great movie that would be made into a trilogy. This movie is quite visible and I think it will stand the test of time. I think kids and parents will love this movie for a long time.","Yeah, I mean the material, directors, the other cast, and if you think you can do something with the character then you do it and go from there. I am looking forward to doing some smaller movies.","You don't improvise with a Cameron Crowe script.","How can you be in hell while you are in my heart?","Whatever happens in life is fine - just trust in that.","I did send a girl a plane ticket asking her for a visit, I guess that's quite romantic.","Failure is simply the non-presence of success. But a fiasco is a disaster of mythic proportions.","I'm still at the beginning of my career. It's all a little new, and I'm still learning as I go.","A friend told me that teenage girls are always looking for someone to pin their dreams on. That doesn't make it any less weird though.","When I was nine, I had this girlfriend and we used to have running races in the park. I wanted to be like Superman and fly in and rescue her.","Although it is a fantasy film, it's as real as it can be. You have to imagine that an audience will buy their ticket to a cinema and get on a first-class flight and journey to Middle Earth.","Vig used to call me 'Elf boy', and I'd call him 'filthy human'. As an Elf, I never got a scratch on me, never got dirty. And Vig would come out with blood and sweat all over him. And he'd say to me, 'Oh, go manicure your nails.'","I'm always amazed at anyone's interest in what I have to say."],"Orlando Brown":["There are many things I love in this world. Music, acting, and animals are at the top of that list."],"Orlando Cepeda":["Trust me, you have to fight. When people are wrong, you've got to let them know it.","When people are wrong, you've got to let them know it."],"Orlando Gibbons":["The silver swan, who, living had no note, When death approached unlocked her silent throat.","It is proportion that beautifies everything, the whole universe consists of it, and music is measured by it."],"Orlando Jones":["I walked in thinking, 'I have ten movies under my belt and now they want me to go back to making commercials?' I said, if I do that, I want it to be funny.","You give the guy an Image Award three years in a row and then turn on him like that? If that's the role they want to fulfill, they need to send a clearer message.","Most of my friends between 21 and 31 are at different stages of figuring out what the hell they are going to do with their lives. It's a big part of our generation. What is the next step?","That was one of the things that interested me about the character. He doesn't want to be a hero, and has no real desire to save the earth or discover aliens. He's sniffing around looking to see what will fall in his lap.","Belly was not a bad movie. It was visually very interesting.","Someone I met years ago explained to me the difference between a personality and an actor, a personality being Eddie Murphy or Roseanne Barr, and an actor being Morgan Freeman and Alfre Woodard or Marlon Brando.","I want to see as many black professionals as possible."],"Ornella Muti":["I've made a dozen films in the English language. But then, for love, for my family and friends, I returned to Europe... I annoyingly - looking back - turned down films like 007, 'For Your Eyes Only,' written specially for me.","I love the early films of Al Pacino - 'Scarface,' 'Serpico' - and I love many science-fiction films.","I take care of myself and take antioxidating supplements suggested by my best friend and first fan - he takes care of my Internet presence - Doctor Mario Rosario Porzio. I eat well - in fact, very well."],"Ornette Coleman":["Jazz is the only music in which the same note can be played night after night but differently each time.","That's what I was trying to say when we were talking about sound. I think that every person, whether they play music or don't play music, has a sound - their own sound, that thing that you're talking about.","You don't have to worry about being a number one, number two, or number three. Numbers don't have anything to do with placement. Numbers only have something to do with repetition.","It's just someone has labelled us as having a different label to do what you do. I find that labels are the worst thing in the world for artistic expression.","It was when I found out I could make mistakes that I knew I was on to something.","You've got to realize. In the western world, regardless of what color you are, what title the music is, it's all played by the same notes.","I've had those people very interested in my writing. Since I think of myself as a composer, I feel really good. I've had lots of guys call me up. I've gotten two or three commissions to write things. I've written lots of movie scores.","To me, human existence exists on a multiple level, not just on a two-dimensional level, not just having to be identified with what you do and what you say.","I decided, if I'm going to be poor and black and all, the least thing I'm going to do is to try and find out who I am. I created everything about me.","Actually, I have another record I made with them in 1976, but I've had such a bad experience with record companies, because I keep my head so much in music and not in business.","Actually, when I was in elementary school, I saw a saxophone. A band came to my school, and I saw this guy get up and play this solo. And I said, 'Oh man, what is that! That must be fantastic!'","After I left Texas and went to California, I had a hard time getting anyone to play anything that I was writing, so I had to end up playing them myself. And that's how I ended up just being a saxophone player.","All the things that human beings suffer from are how their environment treats them, and how the elements of their planet affects their mind and body - like radiation, cancer, and all.","Even when you write it, someone's got to play it. So if you can play it and bypass all the rest of the things, you're still doing as great as someone that has spent forty years trying to find out how to do that. I'm really pro-human beings, pro-expression of everything.","I asked my mother could I have an instrument. She said, 'Well if you go out and save your money.' So I went and got - I made me a shine box. I went out and started shining shoes, and I'd bring whatever I made.","I don't know what they're thinking about. Just because someone says, 'I like what you do' or something: They might like it today and tomorrow they might not. I've had that experience with record companies.","I don't really live like a musician myself. I think music is just something that I do, but I'd like to be doing lots of other things. I like to cure all kinds of illness.","I had a really good time in New Orleans, although I had some very tragic times in Baton Rouge. Some guys beat me up and threw my horn away. 'Cause I had a beard, then, and long hair like the Beatles.","I mean, if you decided to go out today and get you an instrument and do whatever it is that you do, no one can tell you how you're going to do it but when you do it.","I remember once I read a book on mental illness and there was a nurse that had gotten sick. Do you know what she died from? From worrying about the mental patients not being able to get their food. She became a mental patient.","I remember once, we got an interview, and he said, 'Dad, these people are writing about me like I'm an adult. Don't they know I'm a kid?' I have never tried to encourage him to get a music image like other musicians have.","I think that those elements - light and sound - are beyond democratic. They're into the creative part of life.","I'm having this conversation with you now. I'm talking, but I'm thinking, feeling, smelling, and moving. Yet I'm concentrating on what you're saying. So that means there's more things going on in the body than just the present thing that the person's got you doing.","I've been playing with Blackwell over 20 years. We used to play when I first went to Los Angeles. Blackwell plays the drums as if he's playing a wind instrument. Actually, he sounds more like a talking drum.","I've never had a relationship with a record executive. I always went to the record company by someone that liked my playing. Then they would get fired, and I'd be left with the record company. And then - because they got fired - the record company wouldn't do anything for me.","If you decide you want to be treated good, and you treat someone else good, or you want to learn something, it's information. It's getting the right, good information.","It just makes that person feel that what his work is is going to be more valid. But who wants to see a guy standing in front, looking like a bum, doing something that a bums don't do? This don't make sense.","It seems to me that in the western world, culture has something to do with appearance. A person that's out creating good stuff has got to appreciate someone when they take the time to have an appearance that goes with what they're doing.","Most of my relationships have been like that - with record companies. I've never had a legitimate business relationship with a company. I've always had a personal relationship with someone in the company.","No one has to learn to spell to talk, right? You see a little kid holding a conversation with an adult. He probably doesn't know the words he's saying, but he knows where to fit them to make what he's thinking logical to what you're saying.","Originally, I wanted to be a composer. I always tell people, 'I think of myself as a composer.'","So, for instance, if you came to me, I'd ask, 'Do you want to write? Do you want to improvise? Why do you want to play this instrument? What do you want to do?'","That's why I haven't been so anxious. But now, lots of people write and say, 'I want to find out what you're doing.' So I know that this book will enlighten them."],"Orrin Hatch":["I don't think we should be discriminating against anyone. Transgender people are people and deserve the best we can do for them.","Capital punishment is our society's recognition of the sanctity of human life.","It's high time to address research into medical marijuana. Our country has experimented with a variety of state solutions without properly delving into the weeds on the effectiveness, safety, dosing, administration, and quality of medical marijuana.","To be blunt, we need to remove the administrative barriers preventing legitimate research into medical marijuana, which is why I've decided to roll out the MEDS Act.","Every good fighter knows when to hang up the gloves.","Vigilant and effective antitrust enforcement today is preferable to the heavy hand of government regulation of the Internet tomorrow.","If we could get the corporate tax rate down to, let's say, a maximum of 25 percent, it would be a sea change for this country. It would be great.","If we worked together, we could pull this country out of every mess it is in.","The First Amendment is not an altar on which we must sacrifice our children, families, and community standards. Obscene material that is not protected by the First Amendment can and must be prohibited.","No matter how badly senators want to know things, judicial nominees are limited in what they may discuss. That limitation is real, and it comes from the very nature of what judges do.","I may be leaving the Senate, but the next chapter in my public service is just beginning.","I was the original little guy. This country gave me an opportunity. I want our tax system to do the same for others facing those same circumstances.","Microsoft is engaging in unlawful predatory practices that go well beyond the scope of fair competition.","Judges who take the law into their own hands, who make up constitutional 'rights' in order to strike down laws they oppose, undermine the people's right to have their values shape public policy and define the culture.","Our heroes are fighting to bring stability to the Middle East, and they have put pressure on all of the tyrannies of the Middle East. They have taken a stand against tyranny, against terrorists, and for the prospect of decent societies throughout that region.","The Federal government does not have any information about extraterrestrial life to conceal, and there are no secret projects for me to investigate.","I do know dumb-ass questions when I see dumb-ass questions.","We cannot let our respect for the FBI blind us from the fact the FBI has sometimes come up short of our expectations.","The fact is... our doors have not exactly been knocked down by companies willing to defend Microsoft's business practices.","All I can say is God loves this country. We all know it. We wouldn't be where we are without him.","Nobody believes in the CHIP program more than I. I invented it. I was the one who wrote it.","I happen to think CHIP has done a terrific job for for people who really needed the help. I have taken the position around here my whole Senate service. I believe in helping those who cannot help themselves but would if they could.","I have a rough time wanting to spend billions and billions and trillions of dollars to help people who won't help themselves, won't lift a finger, and expect the federal government to do everything.","Unfortunately, the liberal philosophy has created millions of people that way who believe everything they are or ever hope to be depends upon the federal government rather than the opportunities that this great country grants them.","I come from the poor people, and I have been here working my whole stinkin' career for people who don't have a chance, and I really resent anybody that says I'm doing it for the rich. Give me a break.","I come from the lower middle class, originally. We didn't have anything.","I'm for helping the poor, always have been. And I don't think they should be bereft of healthcare.","Although I will miss serving you in the Senate, I look forward to spending more time with family, especially my sweet wife Elaine, whose unwavering love and support made all of this possible.","As your Senator, I always fought the fight for those who could not fight for themselves, and I believe the results speak for themselves.","I've talked to Mitt Romney. He's not going to run for this seat. I would be glad for him if he would.","We have promised to do better, and no Republican concern should ever be enough to filibuster our own bill.","The Indians, they don't fully understand that a lot of the things that they currently take for granted on those lands, they won't be able to do if it's made clearly into a monument or a wilderness. Once you put a monument there, you do restrict a lot of things that could be done, and that includes use of the land... Just take my word for it.","Only in a nation like ours could someone like me, the scrappy son of a simple carpenter, grow up to become a simple senator.","Maybe I should get back to the music-writing phase and write one on tax reform.","Oh, you wouldn't want to hear me sing.","The problem is that we have evil people who try to skirt the laws. And that's the problem."],"Orson F. Whitney":["What has history said of eminence without honor, wealth without wisdom, power and possessions without principle? The answer is reiterated in the overthrow of the mightiest empires of ancient times. Babylon, Persia, Greece, Rome! The four successive, universal powers of the past. What and where are they?","Our Heavenly Father is far more merciful, infinitely more charitable, than even the best of his servants, and the Everlasting Gospel is mightier in power to save than our narrow finite minds can comprehend.","Jesus Christ was a patriot! His country was the world. His laws were the eternal principles of liberty, and his followers, in every age, have been the chosen champions of freedom!","The commonest error made in relation to poetry is that it consists simply in verse-making. Many confound the casket of meter and rhyme with the jewel of thought which it encloses, and, perhaps, in some instances, after close investigation, they have found the casket empty and turned away with feelings of disappointment and disgust.","Poetry is the elder sister of history, the mother of language, the ancestress of civilization.","It is my belief that many who think they dislike poetry are really poetical in their natures and are indebted to it, more than they imagine, for the success they may have achieved, even in practical pursuits, and for the enjoyment their lives have afforded them.","Nearly all men and women are poetical, to some extent, but very few can be called poets. There are great poets, small poets, and men and women who make verses. But all are not poets, nor even good versifiers. Poetasters are plentiful, but real poets are rare. Education can not make a poet, though it may polish and develop one.","You parents of the wilful and the wayward! Don't give them up. Don't cast them off. They are not utterly lost. The Shepherd will find his sheep. They were His before they were yours - long before He entrusted them to your care; and you cannot begin to love them as He loves them.","Sound moral principle is the only sure evidence of strength, the only firm foundation of greatness and perpetuity. Where this is lacking, no man's character is strong; no nation's life can be lasting.","Only those ignorant of what poetry means will ask the question: what is it good for?","Poetry is that sentiment of the soul, or faculty of the mind, which enables its possessor to appreciate and realize the heights and depths of human experience. It is the power to feel pleasure or suffer pain in all its exquisiteness and intensity.","Jesus of Nazareth was a poet, no less than a prophet, of pre-eminent genius.","The spirit of the gospel is optimistic; it trusts in God and looks on the bright side of things. The opposite or pessimistic spirit drags men down and away from God, looks on the dark side, murmurs, complains, and is slow to yield obedience."],"Orson Pratt":["Each atom of the Holy Spirit is intelligent, and like all other matter has solidity, form, and size, and occupies space.","If God had sufficient wisdom and power to construct such a beautiful world as this, then we must admit that his wisdom and power are immeasurably greater than that of man, and hence he is qualified to reign as king.","The kingdom of God is an order of government established by divine authority. It is the only legal government that can exist in any part of the universe.","The kingdom of God is a theocracy. And as it is the only form of government which will redeem and save mankind, it is necessary that every soul should be rightly and thoroughly instructed in regard to its nature and general characteristics.","God is the King. In him exists all legal authority.","God is a spirit. A spirit is as much matter as oxygen or hydrogen.","All the modern christian churches have no more authority to preach, baptize, or administer any other ordinance of the gospel than the idolatrous Hindoos have.","It is a grievous sin in the sight of God for any man to presume to baptize, unless God has authorized him by new revelation to baptize in his name.","Any people attempting to govern themselves by laws of their own making, and by officers of their own appointment, are in direct rebellion against the kingdom of God.","Noah and his family were the only loyal and obedient subjects to the legal power: they alone were saved.","At various times during the last four thousand years God has asserted his rights and endeavoured to establish his own authority, his own laws, and his own government among the children of men.","An order of government, established by such an all-wise, powerful being, must be good and perfect, and must be calculated to promote the permanent peace, happiness, and well-being of all his subjects.","The system of idolatry, invented by modern christianity, far surpasses in absurdity anything that we have ever heard of.","The true God He has extension, and form, and dimensions. He occupies space; has a body, parts, and passions; can go from place to place. He can eat, drink, and talk.","The Godhead consists of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. The Father is a material being.","God the Father and God the Son cannot be everywhere present; indeed they cannot be even in two places at the same instant: but God the Holy Spirit is omnipresent - it extends through all space, with all other matter.","Do not suffer any man to baptize or minister unto you, unless God has spoken unto him by the voice of his servants, and authorized him to minister in his name.","A true servant of God will never teach a false doctrine. He will never deny new revelation. He never will tell you that the canon of scripture is full, or that the New Testament is the last revelation ever intended to be given to man.","It was seldom that I attended any religious meetings, as my parents had not much faith in and were never so unfortunate as to unite themselves with any of the religious sects.","The greatest desire of my heart was for the Lord to manifest His will concerning me.","On the 1st day of December, 1830, I was confirmed, and in accordance with the word of the Lord I was ordained an Elder under the hands of the Prophet.","I was ordained one of the standing High Council in Zion, under the hands of President Joseph Smith."],"Orson Scott Card":["Unemployment is capitalism's way of getting you to plant a garden.","I hope I am remembered by my children as a good father.","The education that prepared me was my general education classes, which I tried to avoid when I was a stupid undergraduate, but which gave me the foundation of general knowledge that makes a career as a writer possible.","Laws against homosexual behavior should remain on the books.","The priests say that God created our souls, and that just puts us under the control of another puppeteer. If God created our will, then he's responsible for every choice we make.","I wonder sometimes if the motivation for writers ought to be contempt, not admiration.","In the moment when I truly understand my enemy, understand him well enough to defeat him, then in that very moment I also love him.","As long as you keep getting born, it's alright to die some times.","Ulysses, obviously. It was an elaborate prank, and our supposed intellectual elite continue to fall for it.","I don't believe that there are aliens. I believe there are really different people.","Working is hard and distracts from having fun.","There's a reason why every human society has fiction. It teaches us how to be 'good', to behave in a way that is for the benefit of the whole community.","Among my most prized possessions are words that I have never spoken.","The lies we live will always be confessed in the stories that we tell.","God, our genes, our environment, or some stupid programmer keying in code at an ancient terminal - there's no way free will can ever exist if we as individuals are the result of some external cause.","Metaphors have a way of holding the most truth in the least space.","It's the middle class that feels the luxury of being able to have causes.","I say this as a Democrat, for whom the Republican domination of government threatens many values that I hold to be important to America's role as a light among nations. But there are no values that matter to me that will not be gravely endangered if we lose this war.","My favourite all-time work of fiction: Lord of the Rings. My favourite all-time nonfiction book: Guns, Germs, and Steel. Ask me again next week, you'll get a different answer.","There is more good writing and good acting in any ten minutes of Twister than in, say, all of Citizen Kane.","I listen to music constantly while writing.","I have lived in the only decades I could have lived in, and hope to live through at least a few more.","In all my study of history, I have never found a time or place I would rather have lived than now.","I am especially grateful, however, to have known the fifties, before we began to poison our own civilization - or at least before the effects of the poison began to be felt.","I buy way too many books.","My college training was primarily in theatre, with an eye to becoming a director, actor, or producer.","I fell into playwriting accidentally, took some classes in it, and also took creative writing classes, but I really didn't expect it to be a career because I didn't believe there was a way to make money as a playwright without being lucky and I didn't feel particularly lucky.","The most important training, though, is to experience life as a writer, questioning everything, inventing multiple explanations for everything. If you do that, all the other things will come; if you don't, there's no hope for you.","But in the meantime I became accustomed to the writing life and it would be hard to change now - partly because of the salary cut if I went to my other love, teaching; and partly because I still have stories to tell, even though it isn't all that fun doing the work anymore.","Writing sessions can last an hour or sixteen hours, depending on how it's going.","Of course, I also hear from critics who detest what I do, and while sometimes I feel rather proud of having made various the loathsome people or groups angry, at other times I wonder why I put up with such grief.","The best thing about my job, though, is stopping at the end of the day and rejoining the human universe.","You who speak languages, you are such liars.","One mind can think only of its own questions; it rarely surprises itself.","Your work is first, learning is first, winning is everything because without it there is nothing.","Everything important in sci-fi showed up in the magazines first. It's the proving ground for new writers and new ideas.","I realized that everything important in sci-fi showed up in the magazines first.

Only through our love and friendship can we create the illusion for the moment that we're not alone.","Create your own visual style... let it be unique for yourself and yet identifiable for others.","If you want a happy ending, that depends, of course, on where you stop your story.","Nobody gets justice. People only get good luck or bad luck.","A film is never really good unless the camera is an eye in the head of a poet.","Ask not what you can do for your country. Ask what's for lunch.","There's no biography so interesting as the one in which the biographer is present.","The classy gangster is a Hollywood invention.","Good evening, ladies and gentleman. My name is Orson Welles. I am an actor. I am a writer. I am a producer. I am a director. I am a magician. I appear onstage and on the radio. Why are there so many of me and so few of you?","Popularity should be no scale for the election of politicians. If it would depend on popularity, Donald Duck and The Muppets would take seats in senate.","Everything about me is a contradiction, and so is everything about everybody else. We are made out of oppositions; we live between two poles. There's a philistine and an aesthete in all of us, and a murderer and a saint. You don't reconcile the poles. You just recognize them.","My doctor told me to stop having intimate dinners for four. Unless there are three other people.","If there hadn't been women we'd still be squatting in a cave eating raw meat, because we made civilization in order to impress our girlfriends.","I want to give the audience a hint of a scene. No more than that. Give them too much and they won't contribute anything themselves. Give them just a suggestion and you get them working with you. That's what gives the theater meaning: when it becomes a social act.","When people accept breaking the law as normal, something happens to the whole society.","The enemy of art is the absence of limitations.","I hate television. I hate it as much as peanuts. But I can't stop eating peanuts.","Gluttony is not a secret vice.","Fake is as old as the Eden tree.","They teach anything in universities today. You can major in mud pies.","The two things you cannot do effectively on stage are pray and copulate.","The first thing one must remember about film is that it is a young medium. And it is essential for every responsible artist to cultivate the ground that has been left fallow.","I'm not a walking extra in a Chekhov play; I'm no Slavic gloom or Irish gloom.","I have an unfortunate personality.","Race hate isn't human nature; race hate is the abandonment of human nature.","I have a great love and respect for religion, great love and respect for atheism. What I hate is agnosticism, people who do not choose.","I think an artist has always to be out of step with his time.","I passionately hate the idea of being with it; I think an artist has always to be out of step with his time.","I've spent most of my mature life trying to prove that I'm not irresponsible.","I have the terrible feeling that, because I am wearing a white beard and am sitting in the back of the theatre, you expect me to tell you the truth about something. These are the cheap seats, not Mount Sinai.","On my tombstone, I want written: 'He never did 'Love Boat!'","I'm a provincial. I live very much like a hermit: reading, listening to music, working in the cutting room, writing, commercial work - which doesn't take up that much time.","Ecstasy is not really part of the scene we can do on celluloid.","People are losing the capacity to listen to words or follow ideas.","I don't want to forgive myself. That's why I hate psychoanalysis I think if you're guilty of something you should live with it. Get rid of it - how can you get rid of a real guilt? I think people should live with it, face up to it.","I don't say we all ought to misbehave, but we ought to look as if we could.","Now I'm an old Christmas tree, the roots of which have died. They just come along and while the little needles fall off me replace them with medallions.","I started at the top and worked my way down.","When you are down and out something always turns up - and it is usually the noses of your friends.","Movie directing is a perfect refuge for the mediocre.","Living in the lap of luxury isn't bad except that you never know when luxury is going to stand up.","The notion of directing a film is the invention of critics - the whole eloquence of cinema is achieved in the editing room.","I feel I have to protect myself against things. So I'm pretty careful to lose most of them.","I've never understood the cult of Hitchcock. Particularly the late American movies... Egotism and laziness. And they're all lit like television shows.","If you've noticed that I don't use long takes, it's not because I don't like them, but because no one gives me the necessary means to treat myself to them. It's more economical to make one image, then this image and then that image, and try to control them later, in the editing studio.","My kind of director is an actor-director who writes.","I know people who have a much better recollection of their childhood than I do. They remember very well when they were a year and a half and two years old. I've only one or two daguerreotypes that come to mind.","I was spoiled in a very strange way as a child, because everybody told me, from the moment I was able to hear, that I was absolutely marvelous, and I never heard a discouraging word for years, you see. I didn't know what was ahead of me.","The best thing commercially, which is the worst artistically, by and large, is the most successful.","The essential is to excite the spectators. If that means playing Hamlet on a flying trapeze or in an aquarium, you do it.","Everybody denies I am a genius - but nobody ever called me one!","Only very intelligent people don't wish they were in politics, and I'm dumb enough to want to be in there.","Did you ever stop to think why cops are always famous for being dumb? Simple. Because they don't have to be anything else.","If I ever own a restaurant, I will never allow the waiters to ask if the diners like their dishes. Particularly when they're talking.","As a producer, sitting on the other side of the desk, I have never once had an agent go out on a limb for his client and fight for him. I've never heard one say, 'No, just a minute! This is the actor you should use.' They will always say, 'You don't like him? I've got somebody else.' They're totally spineless.","In common with all Protestant or Jewish cultures, America was developed on the idea that your word is your bond. Otherwise, the frontier could never have been opened, 'cause it was lawless. A man's word had to mean something.","Anybody who speaks quietly and shrivels up in company is unbelievably arrogant.","The ideal American type is perfectly expressed by the Protestant, individualist, anti-conformist, and this is the type that is in the process of disappearing. In reality there are few left.","I don't pray because I don't want to bore God.","Every actor in his heart believes everything bad that's printed about him.","Personally, I don't like a girlfriend to have a husband. If she'll fool her husband, I figure she'll fool me.","'The Godfather' was the glorification of a bunch of bums who never existed.","I am essentially a hack, a commercial person. If I had a hobby, I would immediately make money on it or abandon it.","A good artist should be isolated. If he isn't isolated, something is wrong.","I do not suppose I shall be remembered for anything. But I don't think about my work in those terms. It is just as vulgar to work for the sake of posterity as to work for the sake of money.","Nobody who takes on anything big and tough can afford to be modest.","The enemy of society is middle class and the enemy of life is middle age.","Hollywood is the only industry, even taking in soup companies, which does not have laboratories for the purpose of experimentation.","The laws and the stage, both are a form of exhibitionism.","Now we sit through Shakespeare in order to recognize the quotations.","At twenty-one, so many things appear solid, permanent, untenable.","Man is a rational animal who always loses his temper when called upon to act in accordance with the dictates of reason.","I've always found it very sanitary to be broke.","Criminals are never very amusing. It's because they're failures. Those who make real money aren't counted as criminals. This is a class distinction, not an ethical problem.","Each multiplex has screens allocated to each studio. The screens need filling. Studios have to create product to fill their screen, and the amount of good product is limited.","Film is like a colony and there are very few colonists.","See, I believe that it is not true that different races and nations are alike. I'm profoundly convinced that that's a total lie. I think people are different. Sardinians, for example, have stubby little fingers. Bosnians have short necks.","If I don't like somebody's looks, I don't like them.","I hate Woody Allen physically, I dislike that kind of man.","In my real movie-going days, which were the thirties, you didn't stand in line. You strolled down the street and sallied into the theater at any hour of the day or night.","I think I made essential a mistake in staying in movies, because I - but it's a mistake I can't regret, because it's like saying, 'I shouldn't have stayed married to that woman, but I did because I love her.'","I never said I was a genius.","Everything bad that has ever happened to me has been caused by agents or lawyers.","I worry a lot about taking care of my dependents, all those perfectly ordinary middle-class preoccupations.","I'm never certain of a performance - my own or the other actors' - or the script or anything... But to me it seems there's only one place in the world the camera can be, and the decision usually comes immediately.","The only reason for doing a play is to make a statement about it, and by that I don't mean a conceit of the producer.","When television came along, I'd already done more than 10 years of radio work and I thought everyone would want me. I sat around waiting for the phone to ring - and it didn't.","I have no great message to the world.","I don't like television when it gets near to photographed plays.","There were centuries when civilization had no theater.","My mother and father were both much more remarkable than any story of mine can make them. They seem to me just mythically wonderful.","Look at the real prodigies, and I look like nothing compared to them.","I would rather be on the set than doing anything.","I'm one of those fellows so frightened of driving that I go 80 miles an hour - and the more frightened I get, the faster I go.","I have made an art form of the interview. The French are the best interviewers, despite their addiction to the triad, like all Cartesians.","I can think of nothing that an audience won't understand. The only problem is to interest them; once they are interested, they understand anything in the world.","I have always been more interested in experiment, than in accomplishment.","I prefer the old masters, by which I mean John Ford, John Ford, and John Ford.","If everyone worked with wide-angle lenses, I'd shoot all my films in 75mm, because I believe very strongly in the possibilities of the 75mm.","One shouldn't ever be conscious of the author as lecturer. When social or moral points are too heavily stressed, I always get uncomfortable."],"Orville Redenbacher":["Every once in a while, someone will mail me a single popcorn kernel that didn't pop. I'll get out a fresh kernel, tape it to a piece of paper and mail it back to them.","Most of the competition was into bulk popcorn because of the major increases in the Drive-In Theatre Outlets.","I moved to Princeton, Indiana, and became a professional Farm Manager for that Princeton Farms.","We dried continuously day and night. We had no efficient way to do it, so we built this new popcorn plant.","It proved easier to buy the farm to get the mineral rights than to buy the coal rights alone.","In the Depression we had to divert corn acreage.","I opened an office in Terre Haute, established eight of them, and became one of the eight county agents.","We got to know the competition very well. In the '50s popcorn made a big growth in sales. Our main push was to produce the best quality and sell in quality retail outlets.","I had popcorn all over the place, so I decided I might as well be in the Processing Business.","It was necessary to have an even depth of corn on the top compared to the sides, so the air would not take the easiest route and not evenly dry the stored corn.","The cobs were delivered to a big pile. We were one of the first to feed corn cobs to cattle.","We made more money feeding molasses, urea, and corn cobs to cattle than we ever did feeding dent corn."],"Orville Wright":["The airplane stays up because it doesn't have the time to fall.","If we all worked on the assumption that what is accepted as true is really true, there would be little hope of advance.","When the machine had been fastened with a wire to the track, so that it could not start until released by the operator, and the motor had been run to make sure that it was in condition, we tossed a coin to decide who should have the first trial. Wilbur won.","In just six weeks from the time the design was started, we had the motor on the block testing its power.","No flying machine will ever fly from New York to Paris.","Isn't it astonishing that all these secrets have been preserved for so many years just so we could discover them!","The course of the flight up and down was exceedingly erratic, partly due to the irregularity of the air, and partly to lack of experience in handling this machine. The control of the front rudder was difficult on account of its being balanced too near the center.","One of the Life Saving men snapped the camera for us, taking a picture just as the machine had reached the end of the track and had risen to a height of about two feet.","We were then satisfied that, with proper lubrication and better adjustments, a little more power could be expected. The completion of the motor according to drawing was, therefore, proceeded with at once.","With all the knowledge and skill acquired in thousands of flights in the last ten years, I would hardly think today of making my first flight on a strange machine in a twenty-seven mile wind, even if I knew that the machine had already been flown and was safe.","A sudden dart when a little over a hundred feet from the end of the track, or a little over 120 feet from the point at which it rose into the air, ended the flight.","We left Dayton, September 23, and arrived at our camp at Kill Devil Hill on Friday, the 25th.","With twelve horse power at our command, we considered that we could permit the weight of the machine with operator to rise to 750 or 800 pounds, and still have as much surplus power as we had originally allowed for in the first estimate of 550 pounds.","We laid the track on a smooth stretch of ground about one hundred feet north of the new building.","No data on air propellers was available, but we had always understood that it was not a difficult matter to secure an efficiency of 50% with marine propellers.","We estimated that we could make one of four cylinders with 4 inch bore and 4 inch stroke, weighing not over two hundred pounds, including all accessories.","In our gliding experiments we had had a number of experiences in which we had landed upon one wing, but the crushing of the wing had absorbed the shock, so that we were not uneasy about the motor in case of a landing of that kind.","The ability to do this so quickly was largely due to the enthusiastic and efficient services of Mr. C.E. Taylor, who did all the machine work in our shop for the first as well as the succeeding experimental machines.","When the motor was completed and tested, we found that it would develop 16 horse power for a few seconds, but that the power rapidly dropped till, at the end of a minute, it was only 12 horse power."],"Os Guinness":["The story of Christian reformation, revival, and renaissance underscores that the darkest hour is often just before the dawn, so we should always be people of hope and prayer, not gloom and defeatism. God the Holy Spirit can turn the situation around in five minutes.","Jesus made clear that the Kingdom of God is organic and not organizational. It grows like a seed and it works like leaven: secretly, invisibly, surprisingly, and irresistibly.","I have lived under totalitarian Communism, so I prize freedom as much as anyone and have long fought for freedom of conscience and speech.","Negative freedom is freedom from - freedom from oppression, whether it's a colonial power or addiction to alcohol oppressing you. You need to be freed from negative freedom. Positive freedom is freedom for, freedom to be. And that's what's routinely ignored today.","Like a precious family heirloom, freedom is not just ours to enjoy, but to treasure, protect, and pass on to future generations.","The rewards of freedom are always sweet, but its demands are stern, for at its heart is the paradox that the greatest enemy of freedom is freedom.","Beyond any question, the way the American founders consistently linked faith and freedom, republicanism and religion, was not only deliberate and thoughtful, it was also surprising and anything but routine.","Augustine says that you don't understand a nation by the throw weight of its military or the strength of its research universities or the size of its population, but by looking at what it loves in common. To assess a nation, you look at the health and strength of its ideals. And there's no question that the common love in America is freedom.","I'm obviously not an advocate of Christian America or a simplistic view of America as 'a city on a hill.'","I give lectures on globalization. I have lived on three continents. I have no quarrel with a global consciousness.","As I understand the American Founders, the most brilliant and daring idea they had was that it's possible to create a free society that could stay free forever.","One of the key places where sociology should be used is in analyzing 'the world' of our times, so that we can be more discerning. To resist the dangers of the world, you have to recognize the distortions and seductions of the world.","The Christian church in the U.S. is still strong numerically, but it has lost its decisive influence both in American public life and in American culture as a whole, especially in the major elite institutions of society.","There are lots of people depending on the government who are good, honest citizens who have worked all their lives.","The American 'unum' has been lost since the Sixties. If this continues, there will soon be no unifying American identity and vision to balance the 'pluribus,' and the days of the Republic will be numbered.","American democracy in the past has always been known for its large middle class and its relatively few very wealthy people and very few very poor people, but that is gone to today and the middle class is shrinking."],"Oscar De La Hoya":["There is always space for improvement, no matter how long you've been in the business.","I think my body went through a lot, went through the wringer. In terms of being inside the ring, getting hit, but also outside the ring, living a crazy life.","Everything I have in this world, I owe to the sport of boxing, and I won't ever forget that.","I think about making a comeback every single day. I went running, I went training, did that for a few days. But my body couldn't handle it.","You get to be famous or have some notoriety and there are so many people who want a piece of you."],"Oscar Fernandes":["Politicisation of terrorism for narrow gains is not good for society in general and the country in particular.","Terrorism should be seen in the light of the country's security and not from the narrow perspective of caste, creed and religion.","Things said by political parties are different from the decisions of the government which are taken to uphold the rule of law. The government takes decisions that are best for the country."],"Oscar Hammerstein II":["Be brave, young lovers, and follow your star.","A bell's not a bell 'til you ring it, A song's not a song 'til you sing it, Love in your heart wasn't put there to stay, Love isn't love 'til you give it away!","Do you love me because I'm beautiful, or am I beautiful because you love me?","You gotta have a dream. If you don't have a dream, how you gonna make a dream come true?","Peace is not the product of a victory or a command. It has no finishing line, no final deadline, no fixed definition of achievement. Peace is a never-ending process, the work of many decisions.","I know the world is filled with troubles and many injustices. But reality is as beautiful as it is ugly. I think it is just as important to sing about beautiful mornings as it is to talk about slums. I just couldn't write anything without hope in it.","If you become a teacher, by your pupils you'll be taught.","What is a sophisticate? He is a man who thinks he can swim better than he can and sometimes he drowns.","The dearest things I know are what you are.","The number of people who will not go to a show they do not want to see is unlimited.","There is nothin' like a dame.","You've got to be taught to hate and fear."],"Oscar Hammerstein":["If you don't have a dream, how are you going to make a dream come true?","All the sounds of the earth are like music."],"Oscar Hijuelos":["When you're writing a novel - at least the way I write is I work from what I would call 'emotional atmosphere,' ambiance to ambiance.","Latins are predisposed to thinking about the past. Catholicism has a lot to do with it because Catholicism is a contemplation of the past, of symbols that are supposed to be eternally present.","Music infuses your spirit with a certain energy that I try to convey in my work.","I have never - I have never let go of my childhood contacts. My best friends from childhood are still my best friends.","When you write fiction, you can sort of invent more but also pack it with emotions that are very pertinent to you. Whereas with nonfiction, you have to be as factual as possible but also hopefully - also bring... emotional relevance to the piece.","I teach at Duke, and I have students who are all of twenty who want to write memoirs, and you know it's all pretty interesting stuff, but a lot of them lack gravitas, you know.","Of course, I grew up hearing Latin music but, to be honest, aside from my personal circumstances, like most kids I wanted to rebel against what I considered to be such old fashioned fare.","I enjoy listening to contemporary rock on the college stations while I'm taking long walks, love gospel and soul music, am fascinated by hip-hop and rap as the new kind of urban 'beat' poetry and, come to think of it, find something interesting about just any kind of music.","It's true that immigrant novels have to do with people going from one country to another, but there isn't a single novel that doesn't travel from one place to another, emotionally or locally.","Nightclubs are the equivalent of a Catholic Church in a poor country. You hear a lot of stuff about churches filled with gold while the people are starving. But what elitists don't get is that for poor people, the church is their own mansion. Nightclubs fill the same function.","If you start believing all that press about you, you're in trouble. I don't even read my reviews.","I like to encourage young talented writers to try and help them get published and so forth, but that's all. That's the best I can do.","People in their forties, fifties, and onward enjoy the whole world of books in a different way than the Internet-age kids do.","As a kid I had all kinds of questions about how I fit it with my neighborhood and friends and other Latinos."],"Oscar Isaac":["I like being like a chameleon who transforms himself with each role.","'Mojave' is a very wild, throwback film with these two dudes going after each other.","I've done movies I'm very proud of, but there's always a sense of: 'Come see this shiny new car!' The question I hate the most is: 'Why should people see it?'","For me, with a character, you start with the shoes.","I like the idea of the comedy of resilience.","'Cool' is detached and emotionally cool. My instinct is to battle anything that seems overly cool.","I get attached to things: I wear the same jeans for a year.","I had an audition where Josh Brolin was pelting me with his personality. I didn't get the part.","I think it's good to be a little more fearless in saying what you feel. In not being scared of the repercussions of that.","I've always liked acoustic blues. I liked Bob Dylan a lot.","I come from a place where everything about me, even my body language, is saying: I mean you no harm. I smile, I laugh. Basic stuff for most people.","There's nothing scarier than unlimited choices.","Usually when I write a song, I'll write the music and then kind of fit some words to it.","I remember the first time my mind was blown by an actor was Tim Curry, because I loved 'Clue' when I was a kid, and then I was watching the movie 'Legend,' and the Devil suddenly smiles, and I was like, 'It's the same guy!' It was a total Keyser Soeze moment.","There's very few people - like Shakespeare - who, no matter what, were gonna do what they did. For the rest of us, there's a lot of events that have to happen in order for things to end up the way they are.","With Shakespeare, there's no subtext; you're speaking exactly what you're thinking constantly.","I grew up in a very devoutly Christian home.","I think that when you decide to dedicate yourself to creative endeavors and surround yourself with people who are creative, you very quickly learn how hard it is to survive doing those kinds of things, not to mention make a living at them.","I don't know if they were all functioning, but I did play in a bunch of bands.","I played guitar and bass. I didn't do much vocals, although I did have one band where I was the lead singer. But that was when I was in college.","My dad always played a lot of music, so I heard him playing all the time, and then I decided that I wanted to learn to play guitar, so I got an acoustic and started taking lessons. I wanted to be able to shred like Yngwie Malmsteen.","My dad was a huge Bob Dylan fan, so we listened to his music, Cat Stevens, Simon & Garfunkel, and all that kind of stuff.","I was never much of a singer. I was terrible. It's embarrassing: I was trying to sound like everybody else. I went through a big Cure phase, so I was trying to do that kind of dramatic voice.","I started off thinking that I just needed one shot to prove myself, but then I realised that I was only going to learn about acting by doing it.","My dad was a doctor, but he was just always, like, going from hospital to hospital for some reason.","I started playing guitar at, like, 12 or 13 and just rock bands mostly. I had a punk rock band and hard core bands and all that.","I've never been much of a guitarist. I mean, I've played forever, but I was always more of a rhythm kind of guy. I don't read music.","A movie set is like a petri dish for neuroses, you know? It's just, like, egos and weird personalities and, more than anything, fear.","I think that's why often people in creative fields can feel so alone is because there's a constant third eye, that constant watcher.","When I'm creating a character, I don't see it so much as playing someone else as just playing a specific part of myself under certain circumstances.","I was in bands, but they were punk bands, and you plug in the guitars, you turn them up really loud, you've got four or five other people on stage with you, you've got some protection from when they throw lighters. You can always hide behind the lead singer or the bass player.","I had a great conversation with Tom Waits, of all people.","There's very few geniuses that come and revolutionize everything. For the rest of us that want to be artists and have something to say, it's a lot of work and a lot of luck.","When I moved to New York, I had to let my band know that I couldn't play anymore, and that was difficult to leave that behind.","When I came up to New York to do a play, I passed by Julliard, and I was like, 'Oh I heard of this place.' I applied, and ended up getting in.","All of my high school issues are resolved!","Max Minghella is a very close friend of mine, and I talk to him regularly.","What's funny in 'The Mayor of MacDougal Street' is how Dave Van Ronk talks a lot about the time and how exciting it was and how electric it was.","I'm so bored by business and money.","It's nice to create a character, not just within two scenes, but within the journey of a whole movie. It's fun to do that.","How do you play 'righteous'? Do you just kind of stand up straighter? What does that mean as an actor? You don't really play a quality.","You watch 'Whale Rider,' and I defy you to not get teary-eyed at the end there.","It'd be crazy to say just because an artist is not successful that means he's not talented. I don't think anybody really believes that, but sometimes it feels that way.","I guess 'Scarface' was the Cuban Al Pacino.","Our morality is based on so many factors: of where we were born, who we were born to, what values were instilled in us, what values we chose, the way that our lives have shaped us. That dictates so much of what we assume is our morality, and also the culture, all of these things.","If you start trying to communicate ideas, I think you don't allow the audience to see themselves.","If you can find a way that your principles are actually the strategically smartest thing to do, you've kind of figured it out.","'Drive' is a genre piece, and a lot of times we don't get really sophisticated genre films.","I think romantic passion is wanting a little something in return.","I always joked with my parents. I told them, 'If I don't make it as an actor, my fallback is musician.'","I think for some reason we're conditioned in movies that the protagonist must be heroic or redeemable in some way, whereas in theater, that's not a necessary.","Jessica Lange was my biggest crush when I was a kid.","Most actors, if you ask them if they play guitar, they'll say they played guitar for 20 years, but what they really mean is they've owned a guitar for 20 years.","I think it's the director's prerogative, not the studio's, to go back and reinvent a movie.","I was always - maybe stupidly so - very confident.","My family are huge 'Star Wars' fans.","Anything that's made by humans is about humans, whether it's about gods or aliens or anything; it's about some sort of expressive nature about us.","I like films that take their time a little bit more and don't show you all of their cards right away, characters that are conflicted and contradicting and seem one way at first and then suddenly turn out to be something else.","What you wear can be such an indicator of so many things. You know, how you feel, how you want others to perceive you. So, that is an absolutely essential part of building a character.","I don't know why people are so obsessed with finding out stuff before the movie comes out. It's so much more fun to just go. I mean, I don't do that. I don't go looking for stuff that I'm interested in, you know, to try and find out pictures and what the movie's about. It's so much more fun to be surprised.","Anybody who dedicates himself to exploring the human condition, there's always a detached eye that's watching. In any situation, a little part of me is observing it, to see if there are any raw materials to create something else later.","The better I am at observing moments in life, the better I'll be at showing them in my acting.","You can't try to be authentic. You either are or you aren't.","I have been playing acoustic music for a very long time, and it's something that I am very comfortable doing, so if I made a record, it would probably be a mixture of that and some other things that I'm interested in.","I actually started playing in little cafes around New York, and I have a lot of good friends of mine who are musicians who are struggling in New York.","Cats are impossible to work with. They're just very difficult because you can't really train them. They're not really interested in whatever you want them to do. Dogs want to please you; cats only want to please themselves.","The motivation is important for me to act it, but I don't necessarily want the audience to know my motivation.","Being someone with Latin roots, so many doors are constantly closed for you because people put you in a category, and the thing I've always wanted to avoid is categorisation.","People resent movies that try to tell them exactly what to feel.","That first play I did in New York, Rogelio Martinez's 'When It's Cocktail Time in Cuba,' I played a young Fidel Castro.","I feel like being an artist and being an activist are separate things; I know some people who feel very differently.","I'm open to the idea of doing more musicals if it's one that I really enjoy.","Every frame of a Coen brothers movie is filled with history and meaning, and the deeper you go, the deeper you get. That's why their movies stand up particularly well to repeated viewing and investigation.","I grow up in the States, in Miami, but I was born in Guatemala, and my father's Cuban, and in 'Body of Lies,' I played an Iraqi.","I think Shakespeare really got it. He was the first one to introduce psychology to villains and give them a real point of view.","A lot of very successful businessmen share some of these sociopathic traits - a lack of empathy, seeing people as commodities, projecting an air of sincerity when everything is actually calculated.","I was interested in the war part of 'Star Wars,' so I started reading about what it's like to go to war, what that does to you psychically, about the adrenaline and the rush.","J. J. Abrams is amazing.","I always like teaser trailers because they don't give too much away, you know? They give just a flavor of what the thing is.","The very first proper play I did was 'Godspell,' and I played the guitar for it, and I had a small part in a high school play. And before that, in sixth grade, I wrote a musical about Noah's ark.","In a play, you dictate pace, you dictate rhythm, you dictate when people look at you, when people should be looking at something else. In film, the editor does that.","I wanted to shred, so I learned classical guitar.","I wouldn't mind seeing The Smiths reform. That would be cool.","I'm really sick of anthems. Every song has to be a very big singalong thing - it feels very Eighties. There are a lot of 'whoah whoa whoahs,' this stadium thing. You're even getting that from some of the 'folk' groups. I can't stand it.","A personal game-changer was when Ridley Scott cast me as King John, the King of England, for 'Robin Hood.'","Advice? Look at your pay statements.","I really just like characters who you don't know where they stand for a long while. It's like people. You hang out with them for 10 years, and then all of a sudden they do something, and you say, 'Who are you?' That's more interesting. In life and on-screen.","I've never been interested in celebrity.","I'm very happy to have the heritage that I do, but I'm not wanting to be 'the Latino actor.' I just want to be 'an actor.'","Getting a record deal is a meaningless thing now.","I've been fortunate to be working mostly right out of school. Every year, there was a little something, and it kept the confidence going. It's about confidence and the belief.","Talent is very hot.","The self-made man that some people believe is a myth? It could be, because you do it on the backs of other people.","The first movie I can remember seeing in the theater was 'Return of the Jedi.' I can remember seeing Darth Vader's helmet come off. The shock of that moment.","The songs I've written that are the strongest, I'm like: 'I don't know where that came from. It just kind of popped out.' You feel you can't take a whole lot of credit for it. I didn't purposefully will it into existence.","In the 1960s, there was a forward way of speaking and inflection.","Humans are mutants, everything's a mutant - things that evolve."],"Oscar Levant":["Roses are red, violets are blue, I'm schizophrenic, and so am I.","There's a fine line between genius and insanity. I have erased this line.","Every time I look at you I get a fierce desire to be lonesome.","Once I make up my mind, I'm full of indecision.","Happiness isn't something you experience; it's something you remember.","Once Dwight Eisenhower makes up his mind, he's full of indecision.","There are two sides to every question: my side and the wrong side.","I'm a study of a man in chaos in search of frenzy.","Schizophrenia beats dining alone.","What the world needs is more geniuses with humility; there are so few of us left.","I have no trouble with y enemies. But my god damn friends... they are the ones that keep me walking the floors at night.","Strip away the phony tinsel of Hollywood and you'll find the real tinsel underneath.","I've given up reading books. I find it takes my mind off myself.","A politician is a man who will double cross that bridge when he comes to it.","Underneath this flabby exterior is an enormous lack of character.","So little time and so little to do.","I have given up reading books; I find it takes my mind off myself.","The only difference between the Democrats and the Republicans is that the Democrats allow the poor to be corrupt, too.","I don't drink. I don't like it. It makes me feel good.","I envy people who drink - at least they know what to blame everything on.","I am no more humble than my talents require.","I knew Doris Day before she was a virgin.","I think a lot of Bernstein - but not as much as he does.","Behind the phony tinsel of Hollywood lies the real tinsel."],"Oscar Munoz":["Communication and communication strategy is not just part of the game - it is the game.","We are deeply sorry for the loss of anything - from your luggage to, of course, a loved pet.","For me, it's common sense to treat other people like you would like to be treated. Empathy is a broad concept, but how do you get there? People get there differently. I get there by truly building a little trust and connection. You'll tell me something, I'll act on it, and then that builds on itself.","I deeply apologize to the customer forcibly removed and to all the customers aboard. No one should ever be mistreated this way. I want you to know that we take full responsibility, and we will work to make it right. It's never too late to do the right thing.","It is important that we win back the trust of employees first, then customers.","Our employees and competitors thought we were docile. We want to be defiantly disruptive. I don't mean necessarily by launching price wars but by being the best at the basics - having the best customer service, the best on-time performance, the best coffee - in a thoughtful, not a testosterone-laced, way.","It is a free world. It is a dynamic of our new day and age: technology is everywhere.","Treating our customers and each other with respect and dignity is at the core of who we are, and we must always remember this no matter how challenging the situation.","To get our passengers where they want to go safely and happily requires thousands of us working together with a shared purpose of supporting each other in serving our customers.","It is my mission to ensure we make the changes needed to provide our customers with the highest level of service and the deepest sense of respect. Ultimately, our actions will speak louder than words.","It's so important that we tell customers what's going on as best as we can. And we're trying to do that. We don't often know ourselves, for so many different factors, but reliability, flexibility, and information are the three critical customer service orientations.","We are dedicated to setting the standard for customer service among U.S. airlines, as we elevate the experience our customers have with us from booking to baggage claim.","We are market based and have to differentiate our product in many ways; pricing isn't the only one.","It is about the entire experience. It's not just a new seat. It's not just new meals. It's not just better wines.","At United, I will dedicate myself to making our airline flyer-friendly.","Uncertainty always creates doubt, and doubt creates fear.","The airline industry has been closely watching, monitoring, exactly what the rail industry has done.","There are no more holes in my management lineup.","When LeBron James shows up at your doorstep, you're going to let him practice with your team if not join the team.","If you feel anything weird, immediately call 911 and give them your address because you may not make it past the phone call.","We had taken the cups for coffee out of the building as a cost-saving measure, but left the coffee. Somebody thought it was symbolic to do this.","I'm told by our internal surveys that we take of customers - by customers themselves directly and by a very large group of our employees - that there's a new spirit at United.","I feel terrific - my mind, my energy, my focus continues to be what it always has been, and I have a renewed sense of purpose.","I represent the interests of almost 90,000 human beings in our system. That's by far my first and foremost commitment.","I think we have a thriving economic engine between not only the U.S. and Mexico but the U.S. and many, many other countries.","As board members, we only meet infrequently and are not as engaged with the front line, necessarily. The first thing I did as CEO was I left this board room.","Let's be honest: the implementation of the United and Continental merger has been rocky for customers and employees.","We are committed to re-earning your trust.","We will not only be more flexible when it comes to price, we'll also be more efficient operationally by forgoing pre-assigned seating, priority boarding, upgrading the option for last-minute changes.","We set out to reinvent the whole business class experience. We went back to re-engineer everything we had thought about and made sleep a priority.","The level of improvement has been great across the industry, and we have improved along with everyone.","Our progress isn't just limited to the operation. Financially, we have been performing well. United's 2015 earnings were one of the best in the company's history, and we made significant progress shrinking the margin gap with our closest competitors, strengthening our balance sheet, and returning significant cash to shareholders.","United spent $1.2 billion repurchasing shares in 2015 and plans to spend $1.5 billion on share repurchases in the first quarter of 2016. We have a lot of positive momentum, but this is just the beginning.","I am thrilled to return full time to a job and the employees I love.","We have to realize we have millions of human beings traveling on our equipment.","Our parents taught us to work hard and never forget our family roots, where we came from, and how much effort it took to get to where we are today.","Everyone has images in their mind of what to expect from different groups.","Somewhere in the mix, we forgot the very critical people who deliver the service.","United's 2015 earnings were one of the best in the company's history.","We didn't have nine brands of cereal at home. We'd line up to fill our bowls from a giant vat of oatmeal.","Simply put, we haven't lived up to your expectations... That's going to change.","It's the human approach to customers that I want to bring back.","We have significant work to be done. We have old, antiquated systems. Remember the 8-track tape player? Think of that as our core system, and we're living in a world where everybody has an iPhone.","In the telecommunications, consumer products, and railway businesses, there are very real consequences if you don't meet the consumer's needs and desires. There are also substantive rewards for doing so, and especially for exceeding customer expectations.","Getting people where they want to go, reliably and happily, can make or break their ability to succeed in a work endeavor or to hug a family member at an important moment.","I am a first-generation college graduate, and I'm proud to say that most of my other siblings have college degrees as well. Our parents taught us to work hard and never forget our family roots, where we came from, and how much effort it took to get to where we are today.","We are not going to put a law enforcement official onto a plane to take them off... to remove a booked, paid, seated passenger. We can't do that.","I think my reaction to most issues is to get the facts and circumstances.","We have not provided our frontline supervisors and managers and individuals with the proper procedures that would allow them to use their common sense.","We're going to teach and broaden sort of the cultural impact of respect and dignity, regardless of where you're sitting. And that's why we've said once you've boarded an aircraft, we're not going to take you off except for safety and security.","You forget sometimes that the people you're carrying are human.","I think one of the things that, at least, I found out over - and many have in the industry - is that of all the customer service desires and needs, price is one of them.","It's a new era with regard to social media. It's just something that we have to adapt to and accept.","We have such rigid rules, sometimes, that they don't have to be rules. They can be policies and procedures that can be adapted for the moment.","I can't tell you how many thousands of small moments that I've had with employees in our company that have been nothing more than a one-on-one. I'll see the baggage-services person, he or she is by himself. I'll pull them off to the side and have a 15-minute conversation about their history, their life, that kind of thing.","If I have any strength that would be considered above average, it is that I can read people.","Clearly, nutrition is great. I was a vegan, so being an athlete and a vegan certainly sounds like it would be the right thing to prevent something like heart disease, but it's highly genetic.","I was hired to make United better, and that's what we'll do.","The process of overbooking is a complicated one. It's actually minimal. We, on certain flights, overbook by one or two people.","I think we need to communicate more effectively how we treat you with respect and dignity as a customer.","If you fly and you look around today and you see our United family, you see them incredibly motivated and focused on making things right.","Clearly, on a visceral human front, I oppose any wall, anywhere, between any people - period.","I think the hardest thing that, historically, the industry may have relied upon is that we can't control weather, we can't control air traffic control, and use that at the end of the day as an excuse. Things do happen - we know they happen. We don't exactly know when they are going to happen, but we should definitely be prepped.","We have some inherent cost and infrastructure issues that are difficult to deal with, no questions. From my perspective, we have to work on the revenue side primarily. We've lost some customers. We need to rebuild the trust with those customers and get them back.","At the end of the day, the differential, I believe, on the airline space has got to be about the product and the service that you provide. And again, I can't express that enough. That comes from people. It is a people business, and my primary focus is to get our 84,000-plus people back aligned, back engaged, and back focused on our customer.","I believe we must go further in redefining what United's corporate citizenship looks like in our society... and we intend to live up to those higher expectations in the way we embody social responsibility and civic leadership everywhere we operate.","Everyone eventually matches or leapfrogs everyone else.","I feel most comfortable in the hangars and ramps.","This is a pattern-bargaining industry, like railroads. You need to pay market to get a contract at all, and without contracts, you have a poor relationship with workers."],"Oscar Niemeyer":["Right angles don't attract me. Nor straight, hard and inflexible lines created by man.","Curves are the essence of my work because they are the essence of Brazil, pure and simple.","Form follows beauty.","It was the drawing that led me to architecture, the search for light and astonishing forms.","For me beauty is valued more than anything - the beauty that is manifest in a curved line or in an act of creativity.","Architecture will always express the technical and social progress of the country in which it is carried out. If we wish to give it the human content that it lacks, we must participate in the political struggle.","I search for surprise in my architecture. A work of art should cause the emotion of newness.","I pick up my pen. It flows. A building appears. There it is. There is nothing more to say.","I am a Brazilian before I am an architect. I cannot separate the two.","My work is not about 'form follows function,' but 'form follows beauty' or, even better, 'form follows feminine.'","It is not with architecture that one can disseminate any political ideology.","When I was very little my mother said I used to draw in the air with my fingers. I needed a pencil. Once I could hold one, I have drawn every day since.","Humanity needs dreams to be able to survive the miseries of daily existence, even if only for an instant.","Architecture is invention.","Architecture is my work, and I've spent my whole life at a drawing board, but life is more important than architecture. What matters is to improve human beings.","The artistic capability of reinforced concrete is so fantastic - that is the way to go.","Surprise is key in all art.","Sometimes I lose a whole morning waiting on journalists and other people who look for me. But I always find some time for reading, talking to my friends and feeling what is happening in this world.","I enter my studio at 9 a.m. I have lunch here, I return right away to my work and I go out to dinner at 8 p.m. My daily tasks vary very much.","I think of myself as no more than 60. What I could do at 60, I can still do now.","Of course, I have given my engineers some headaches over the years, but they go with me. I have always wanted my buildings to be as light as possible, to touch the ground gently, to swoop and soar, and to surprise.","When students leave college, they are like children who know nothing about the problems of life, and don't have a political stance.","There is no reason to design buildings that are more basic and rectilinear, because with concrete you can cover almost any space.","I like talking to priests, to Catholics. Everyone has their beliefs.","The challenge of a cathedral is very good for architectural inventiveness."],"Oscar Nunez":["I like freedom. I wake up in the morning and say, 'I don't know, should I have a popsicle or a donut?' You know, who knows?","I watched TV religiously when I was a kid, but nowadays - with the Internet - there's so many people writing about TV on the Internet, that everything's sort of under a magnifying glass.","I like game shows.","I still use quill and parchment. I do e-mails, and I write, but I don't go around surfing too much.","I'm pretty much a straight guy on 'The Office.' We can't all be crazies. You need some balance.","I've always loved improv. It's my thing.","I am Cuban, my parents are Cuban, and I was not adopted.","I've always just been attracted to comedy.","Stand-up, I find it really difficult. It's not really my thing.","Life in California is beautiful.","Yeah, I just don't break. I don't. And there's only one person I know who's a better non-breaker than me, and that's Will Forte from 'SNL.' You can not make that guy break. I'll break eventually - Will Forte will never break.","Quality attracts quality. People want to be on a good show.","Ricky Gervais is a genius.","I remember, growing up, if something big - God forbid - happened, the first jokes you heard on the subject came out of Jersey."],"Oscar Peterson":["It's the group sound that's important, even when you're playing a solo.","I believe in using the entire piano as a single instrument capable of expressing every possible musical idea.","Some people try to get very philosophical and cerebral about what they're trying to say with jazz. You don't need any prologues, you just play.","If you have something to say of any worth then people will listen to you.","Too many jazz pianists limit themselves to a personal style, a trademark, so to speak. They confine themselves to one type of playing.","I am the worlds laziest writer.","I don't do something because I think it will sell 30 million albums. I couldn't care less. If it sells one, it sells one.","I have no one style.","We're not like pop musicians who have to perform the same top ten tunes every night of a tour.","I play as I feel.","The music field was the first to break down racial barriers, because in order to play together, you have to love the people you are playing with, and if you have any racial inhibitions, you wouldn't be able to do that.","I don't believe that a lot of the things I hear on the air today are going to be played for as long a time as Coleman Hawkins records or Brahms concertos.","You not only have to know your own instrument, you must know the others and how to back them up at all times. That's jazz."],"Oscar Pistorius":["Everyone has setbacks. I'm no different. I happen to have no legs. That's pretty much the fact.","My parents didn't give me any scope to feel sorry for myself. They were just like 'go play with your brother, go climb a tree, go fall off your motorbike, do whatever you want. Don't come crying to us when you get scratched. You've got prosthetic legs - that's very nice.'","I don't see myself as disabled. There's nothing I can't do that able-bodied athletes can do.","I have a strong sense that I have to educate people about disability.","Out of the tens of thousands of prosthetic legs they've made, there's never been any 400-meter athletes run under 50 seconds. So, if this was such a technologically advanced prosthetic leg, then how come not everyone's qualifying, or coming close to the qualification time, then?","I'd like to show people that if you put the hard work in and you believe in yourself, then you can do whatever you want to.","When you're competing, you don't have the choice of what the weather will be like. It really doesn't affect me. I ran one of my fastest times in the New York Diamond League meeting last year. It was raining pretty hard then.","To have been selected to represent Team South Africa at the London 2012 Olympic Games in the individual 400m and the 4x400m relay is a real honor and I am so pleased that years of hard work, determination and sacrifice have all come together.","Thank you to everyone that has made me the athlete I am! God, family and friends, my competitors and supporters! You have all had a hand!","I have run two Olympic 'A' standard times over the past 12 months and with the time I ran at the African Championships last week I know my speed and fitness are constantly improving so that I will peak in time for the Olympics.","I have a phenomenal team behind me who have helped get me here and I, along with them, will now put everything we can into the final few weeks of preparations before the Olympic Games, where I am aiming to race well, work well through the rounds, post good times and maybe even a personal best time on the biggest stage of them all.","I am also hugely excited to then be competing to defend my three Paralympic titles at the Paralympic Games. I believe we will see some amazing times posted and I am very much looking forward to what will be an incredible Olympics and Paralympics in London.","I wasn't happy with my performance at the World Championships in Daegu. I had an unbelievable race in the heats, but misjudged the semi and finished last.","I still find it strange, I suppose, when I say to someone, 'Can you just pass me my leg?' But I don't ever think about my disability.","Putting on my legs is like putting on my shoes. I understand that's how some people might think differently, but I hope that in London, their perceptions open up.","The more I accomplish, the more pressure I put on myself.","I don't want to be competing in a sport where I feel that I'm here not on my talent and my hard work but because of a piece of equipment.","I can have my goals, and I can have my dreams. My goal is to make the finals and improve my position. I want to run all decent races. I don't want to look back and say I ran a terrible race.","I want to wake up every day and feel that I'm training harder than my competitors, that I'm dieting harder, that I'm recovering better. That's what gives me confidence when I'm lining up on the blocks. I've never gone out to prove people wrong. I just want to be the best that I can possibly be.","These have always been my legs. I train harder than other guys, eat better, sleep better and wake up thinking about athletics. I think that's probably why I'm a bit of an exception.","Rio in four years; I've got more inspiration in the last two, three weeks. I'm sure I'm going to get more in the Paralympics in the next coming weeks, so by the end of this season, I'm going to take a month off, and then the next four years is going to be good."],"Oscar Robertson":["If you're a basketball player, you've got to shoot.","I think that everyone should be able to dribble. Everyone should be able to pass. Otherwise, why are you out there?","They should have a rule: in order to be a sportswriter, you have to have played that sport, at some level; high school, college, junior college, somewhere. Or, you should have had to have been around the game for a long time.","I think that basketball players should get the job done no matter how it looks on the screen.","I don't think that players learn how to play any other aspect of the game in high school or college.","It's like all guys want to do is make a dunk, grab their shirt and yell out and scream - they could be down 30 points but that's what they do. Okay, so you made a dunk. Get back down the floor on defense!","I don't blame David Stern because a player gets on the court and he doesn't put out competitively. No one can make you play if you don't want to play.","When you go into a game on offense, you make a couple moves and see what the defender is going to do. Then you pretty much can figure out what he is going to do against you - whether he carries his hands low or high, whether he is bumping or pushing, those type of things.","Basketball is basketball.","But I like to think an athlete is an athlete.","But I think the image that's thrown out on television is a bad image. Because you see players who want to imitate hip-hop stars. And the NBA is taking advantage of the situation.","But if people are buying the products, naturally they're gonna use them.","I think that teaching coaches are the norm now.","I was taught to play that way when I was in high school and even before I got to high school.","I'd like to think that the nature of the two teams - Boston being a championship team over the years and the Lakers, same thing - was a lot bigger than Larry Bird or Magic Johnson.","It's a sad commentary when I have to say that sometimes in our country we are real sensitive to race.","Now, I guess, people want stars. People are trying to invent stars.","Some players are more physical than others, some play with more finesse. Some are just really great all-around players. So you have to change your game.","The Olympics were great, because you had to make the team, and then go to the games. Now, I don't know, these guys today don't want to do anything like that.","The thing about it is almost everyone could pass that way, but we were kept from doing it by our coaches.","This is where young players today want to land. They want to be NBA players because of the money.","We're all Americans trying to compete. Magic was competing for his team and Larry for his team.","When you play against different people from all walks of life you can't do the same thing against every player defensively or offensively. You have to change up the way you go at a player.","When you play guard, you're not going to block a lot of shots. Inside, you're going to block shots.","Who do I think was the greatest? This might shock you: Elgin Baylor. He did so many great things. Nobody could guard him, playing in the forward spot. I'd love to see some of today's greats playing against Elgin. They couldn't guard him. Nobody could.","You don't cut anywhere, don't pick down anywhere, don't double screen, no weak side picking. All these things that should happen in a game of basketball don't happen anymore.","You look at today, it's a different situation. You have a game that has been transformed into a game where almost every shot is either an outside shot - a three-point shot - or a dunk.","You need a teaching coach who understands the game of basketball, not just some guy coming on the court talking about Xs and Os.","You see what happens in college and high school games today - a three-point shot or a dunk. I think that's the reason that you see a lot of that in the pros today.","You've got to learn the footwork, the positioning, how to box out, how to pass, how to shoot your free throws. All these things are necessary, not to be the No. 1 player in the world, but maybe you can play against him."],"Oscar Taveras":["I work very hard at my game.","I will try to give my 100% in the field and do my job.","I try to work on my defense every game, every practice.","I feel comfortable any position I play. It doesn't matter.","My father was an outfielder in the Milwaukee system before he hurt his elbow.","Play for Canada? Why not? I have a Canadian passport.","I lived in Montreal from the time I was 12 until I was 16."],"Oscar Wilde":["Keep love in your heart. A life without it is like a sunless garden when the flowers are dead.","Men always want to be a woman's first love - women like to be a man's last romance.","If you are not too long, I will wait here for you all my life.","Success is a science; if you have the conditions, you get the result.","Women are made to be loved, not understood.","Memory... is the diary that we all carry about with us.","I am so clever that sometimes I don't understand a single word of what I am saying.","Experience is simply the name we give our mistakes.","True friends stab you in the front.","The truth is rarely pure and never simple.","A gentleman is one who never hurts anyone's feelings unintentionally.","A dreamer is one who can only find his way by moonlight, and his punishment is that he sees the dawn before the rest of the world.","To expect the unexpected shows a thoroughly modern intellect.","Laughter is not at all a bad beginning for a friendship, and it is far the best ending for one.","The only thing to do with good advice is to pass it on. It is never of any use to oneself.","No better way is there to learn to love Nature than to understand Art. It dignifies every flower of the field. And, the boy who sees the thing of beauty which a bird on the wing becomes when transferred to wood or canvas will probably not throw the customary stone.","I can resist everything except temptation.","Morality is simply the attitude we adopt towards people whom we personally dislike.","Our ambition should be to rule ourselves, the true kingdom for each one of us; and true progress is to know more, and be more, and to do more.","Every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not of the sitter.","I have the simplest tastes. I am always satisfied with the best.","Most people are other people. Their thoughts are someone else's opinions, their lives a mimicry, their passions a quotation.","There is only one thing in life worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about.","It is absurd to divide people into good and bad. People are either charming or tedious.","It is better to be beautiful than to be good. But... it is better to be good than to be ugly.","We are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars.","Always forgive your enemies - nothing annoys them so much.","Some cause happiness wherever they go; others whenever they go.","Selfishness is not living as one wishes to live, it is asking others to live as one wishes to live.","Everything popular is wrong.","Man is least himself when he talks in his own person. Give him a mask, and he will tell you the truth.","No man is rich enough to buy back his past.","The only difference between the saint and the sinner is that every saint has a past, and every sinner has a future.","One should always be in love. That is the reason one should never marry.","The true mystery of the world is the visible, not the invisible.","To love oneself is the beginning of a lifelong romance.","The old believe everything, the middle-aged suspect everything, the young know everything.","By giving us the opinions of the uneducated, journalism keeps us in touch with the ignorance of the community.","The only way to get rid of temptation is to yield to it... I can resist everything but temptation.","In judging of a beautiful statue, the aesthetic faculty is absolutely and completely gratified by the splendid curves of those marble lips that are dumb to our complaint, the noble modelling of those limbs that are powerless to help us.","Beauty is the only thing that time cannot harm. Philosophies fall away like sand, creeds follow one another, but what is beautiful is a joy for all seasons, a possession for all eternity.","The world is a stage, but the play is badly cast.","All women become like their mothers. That is their tragedy. No man does. That's his.","One's real life is so often the life that one does not lead.","Woman begins by resisting a man's advances and ends by blocking his retreat.","Bad people are, from the point of view of art, fascinating studies. They represent colour, variety and strangeness. Good people exasperate one's reason; bad people stir one's imagination.","Society exists only as a mental concept; in the real world there are only individuals.","Work is the curse of the drinking classes.","Nothing is so aggravating than calmness.","Conversation about the weather is the last refuge of the unimaginative.","There is no sin except stupidity.","When the gods wish to punish us they answer our prayers.","Consistency is the last refuge of the unimaginative.","Life imitates art far more than art imitates Life.","Education is an admirable thing, but it is well to remember from time to time that nothing that is worth knowing can be taught.","If a work of art is rich and vital and complete, those who have artistic instincts will see its beauty, and those to whom ethics appeal more strongly than aesthetics will see its moral lesson. It will fill the cowardly with terror, and the unclean will see in it their own shame.","Life is never fair, and perhaps it is a good thing for most of us that it is not.","I have a dining room done in different shades of white, with white cushions embroidered in yellow silk: the effect is absolutely delightful and the room beautiful.","This suspense is terrible. I hope it will last.","Deceiving others. That is what the world calls a romance.","Technique is really personality. That is the reason why the artist cannot teach it, why the pupil cannot learn it, and why the aesthetic critic can understand it.","She is a peacock in everything but beauty.","Moderation is a fatal thing. Nothing succeeds like excess.","One should always play fairly when one has the winning cards.","How can a woman be expected to be happy with a man who insists on treating her as if she were a perfectly normal human being.","Hatred is blind, as well as love.","I am not young enough to know everything.","Everybody who is incapable of learning has taken to teaching.","The mark of all good art is not that the thing done is done exactly or finely, for machinery may do as much, but that it is worked out with the head and the workman's heart.","You will always be fond of me. I represent to you all the sins you have never had the courage to commit.","Seriousness is the only refuge of the shallow.","In England, an inventor is regarded almost as a crazy man, and in too many instances, invention ends in disappointment and poverty. In America, an inventor is honoured, help is forthcoming, and the exercise of ingenuity, the application of science to the work of man, is there the shortest road to wealth.","All art is quite useless.","How marriage ruins a man! It is as demoralizing as cigarettes, and far more expensive.","Ambition is the last refuge of the failure.","Whenever people agree with me I always feel I must be wrong.","Art is the most intense mode of individualism that the world has known.","Life is far too important a thing ever to talk seriously about.","The basis of optimism is sheer terror.","Patriotism is the virtue of the vicious.","Bigamy is having one wife too many. Monogamy is the same.","An excellent man; he has no enemies; and none of his friends like him.","Only the shallow know themselves.","Ordinary riches can be stolen; real riches cannot. In your soul are infinitely precious things that cannot be taken from you.","A little sincerity is a dangerous thing, and a great deal of it is absolutely fatal.","Experience is one thing you can't get for nothing.","The critic has to educate the public; the artist has to educate the critic.","Ridicule is the tribute paid to the genius by the mediocrities.","Children begin by loving their parents; after a time they judge them; rarely, if ever, do they forgive them.","I think that God, in creating man, somewhat overestimated his ability.","I want my food dead. Not sick, not dying, dead.","A man who does not think for himself does not think at all.","I have nothing to declare except my genius.","Do you really think it is weakness that yields to temptation? I tell you that there are terrible temptations which it requires strength, strength and courage to yield to.","Nothing, indeed, is more dangerous to the young artist than any conception of ideal beauty: he is constantly led by it either into weak prettiness or lifeless abstraction: whereas to touch the ideal at all, you must not strip it of vitality.","I am the only person in the world I should like to know thoroughly.","The salesman knows nothing of what he is selling save that he is charging a great deal too much for it.","I always pass on good advice. It is the only thing to do with it. It is never of any use to oneself.","Art is individualism, and individualism is a disturbing and disintegrating force.","When a man has once loved a woman he will do anything for her except continue to love her.","I never travel without my diary.

To be in it is merely a bore. But to be out of it is simply a tragedy.","All bad poetry springs from genuine feeling.","To lose one parent may be regarded as a misfortune; to lose both looks like carelessness.","There are only two tragedies in life: one is not getting what one wants, and the other is getting it.","A man can be happy with any woman, as long as he does not love her.","Who, being loved, is poor?","Pessimist: One who, when he has the choice of two evils, chooses both.","Ambition is the germ from which all growth of nobleness proceeds.","Between men and women there is no friendship possible. There is passion, enmity, worship, love, but no friendship.","I put all my genius into my life; I put only my talent into my works.","The man who can dominate a London dinner-table can dominate the world.","Questions are never indiscreet, answers sometimes are.","It is the spectator, and not life, that art really mirrors.","I see when men love women. They give them but a little of their lives. But women when they love give everything.","If you pretend to be good, the world takes you very seriously. If you pretend to be bad, it doesn't.

Those who go beneath the surface do so at their peril. Those who read the symbol do so at their peril. It is the spectator, and not life, that art really mirrors. Diversity of opinion about a work of art shows that the work is new, complex and vital.","When good Americans die they go to Paris.","It is through art, and through art only, that we can realise our perfection.","A man's face is his autobiography. A woman's face is her work of fiction.","Democracy means simply the bludgeoning of the people by the people for the people.","Yes, there is a terrible moral in 'Dorian Gray' - a moral which the prurient will not be able to find in it, but it will be revealed to all whose minds are healthy. Is this an artistic error? I fear it is. It is the only error in the book.","There is a luxury in self-reproach. When we blame ourselves we feel no one else has a right to blame us.","Arguments are to be avoided: they are always vulgar and often convincing.","In designing the scenery and costumes for any of Shakespeare's plays, the first thing the artist has to settle is the best date for the drama. This should be determined by the general spirit of the play more than by any actual historical references which may occur in it.","The well bred contradict other people. The wise contradict themselves.","Fashion is a form of ugliness so intolerable that we have to alter it every six months.","The books that the world calls immoral are books that show the world its own shame.","There are many things that we would throw away if we were not afraid that others might pick them up.","A poet can survive everything but a misprint.","Those whom the gods love grow young.","There is nothing so difficult to marry as a large nose.","In America the young are always ready to give to those who are older than themselves the full benefits of their inexperience.","The typewriting machine, when played with expression, is no more annoying than the piano when played by a sister or near relation.","America is the only country that went from barbarism to decadence without civilization in between.","It is always the unreadable that occurs.","In all matters of opinion, our adversaries are insane.","Most people die of a sort of creeping common sense, and discover when it is too late that the only things one never regrets are one's mistakes.","Man can believe the impossible, but man can never believe the improbable.","There's nothing in the world like the devotion of a married woman. It's a thing no married man knows anything about.","I have never given adoration to any body except myself.","'The Lady's World' should be made the recognized organ for the expression of women's opinions on all subjects of literature, art and modern life, and yet it should be a magazine that men could read with pleasure.","Alas, I am dying beyond my means.","No great artist ever sees things as they really are. If he did, he would cease to be an artist.","Romantic art deals with the exception and with the individual. Good people, belonging as they do to the normal, and so, commonplace type, are artistically uninteresting.","There is always something ridiculous about the emotions of people whom one has ceased to love.","There are only two kinds of people who are really fascinating - people who know absolutely everything, and people who know absolutely nothing.","He has no enemies, but is intensely disliked by his friends.","America had often been discovered before Columbus, but it had always been hushed up.","A critic should be taught to criticise a work of art without making any reference to the personality of the author.","London is too full of fogs and serious people. Whether the fogs produce the serious people, or whether the serious people produce the fogs, I don't know.","I sometimes think that God in creating man somewhat overestimated his ability.","Perhaps one of the most difficult things for us to do is to choose a notable and joyous dress for men. There would be more joy in life if we were to accustom ourselves to use all the beautiful colours we can in fashioning our own clothes.","If one plays good music, people don't listen and if one plays bad music people don't talk.","Men marry because they are tired; women, because they are curious; both are disappointed.","If one could only teach the English how to talk, and the Irish how to listen, society here would be quite civilized.","The advantage of the emotions is that they lead us astray.","One of the many lessons that one learns in prison is, that things are what they are and will be what they will be.","It is a very sad thing that nowadays there is so little useless information.","Women love us for our defects. If we have enough of them, they will forgive us everything, even our gigantic intellects.","The one charm about marriage is that it makes a life of deception absolutely necessary for both parties.","I choose my friends for their good looks, my acquaintances for their good characters, and my enemies for their intellects. A man cannot be too careful in the choice of his enemies.","Mr. Henry James writes fiction as if it were a painful duty.","Those who find ugly meanings in beautiful things are corrupt without being charming. This is a fault.","Art never harms itself by keeping aloof from the social problems of the day: rather, by so doing, it more completely realises for us that which we desire.","The world has grown suspicious of anything that looks like a happily married life.","As long as war is regarded as wicked, it will always have its fascination. When it is looked upon as vulgar, it will cease to be popular.","There should be a law that no ordinary newspaper should be allowed to write about art. The harm they do by their foolish and random writing it would be impossible to overestimate - not to the artist, but to the public, blinding them to all but harming the artist not at all.","Now that the House of Commons is trying to become useful, it does a great deal of harm.","The difference between literature and journalism is that journalism is unreadable and literature is not read.","I like persons better than principles, and I like persons with no principles better than anything else in the world.","There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well written, or badly written.","Why was I born with such contemporaries?","In married life three is company and two none.","The public is wonderfully tolerant. It forgives everything except genius.","A thing is not necessarily true because a man dies for it.","What we have to do, what at any rate it is our duty to do, is to revive the old art of Lying.","I can stand brute force, but brute reason is quite unbearable. There is something unfair about its use. It is hitting below the intellect.","There is always something infinitely mean about other people's tragedies.","The function of the artist is to invent, not to chronicle.","Art should never try to be popular. The public should try to make itself artistic.","In its primary aspect, a painting has no more spiritual message than an exquisite fragment of Venetian glass. The channels by which all noble and imaginative work in painting should touch the soul are not those of the truths of lives.","I would have a workshop attached to every school, and one hour a day given up to the teaching of simple decorative arts. It would be a golden hour to the children.","There is nothing in the world like the devotion of a married woman. It is a thing no married man knows anything about.","Nothing can cure the soul but the senses, just as nothing can cure the senses but the soul.","No woman should ever be quite accurate about her age.

That is the only proper basis for family life.","Man is a rational animal who always loses his temper when he is called upon to act in accordance with the dictates of reason.","Arguments are extremely vulgar, for everyone in good society holds exactly the same opinion.","One can survive everything, nowadays, except death, and live down everything except a good reputation.","The imagination imitates. It is the critical spirit that creates.","One's past is what one is. It is the only way by which people should be judged.","Whenever a man does a thoroughly stupid thing, it is always from the noblest motives.","There is only one class in the community that thinks more about money than the rich, and that is the poor. The poor can think of nothing else.","There is no necessity to separate the monarch from the mob; all authority is equally bad.","There is something terribly morbid in the modern sympathy with pain. One should sympathise with the colour, the beauty, the joy of life. The less said about life's sores the better.","Romance should never begin with sentiment. It should begin with science and end with a settlement.","Anybody can be good in the country. There are no temptations there.","It is only by not paying one's bills that one can hope to live in the memory of the commercial classes.","In modern life nothing produces such an effect as a good platitude. It makes the whole world kin.","Writing bores me so.","I think it is perfectly natural for any artist to admire intensely and love a young man. It is an incident in the life of almost every artist.","Beauty has as many meanings as man has moods. Beauty is the symbol of symbols. Beauty reveals everything, because it expresses nothing. When it shows us itself, it shows us the whole fiery-coloured world.","Literature must rest always on a principle, and temporal considerations are no principle at all. For, to the poet, all times and places are one; the stuff he deals with is eternal and eternally the same: no theme is inept, no past or present preferable."],"Oscar de la Renta":["Fashion is about dressing according to what's fashionable. Style is more about being yourself.","The qualities I most admire in women are confidence and kindness.","I always say: To be well dressed you must be well naked.","I like light, color, luminosity. I like things full of color and vibrant.","I don't really know how to do casual clothes.","Gardening is how I relax. It's another form of creating and playing with colors.","I'm a very restless person. I'm always doing something. The creative process never stops.","There is always an emotional element to anything that you make.","I wanted this, I wanted to do this, but my work is me, and it has to be right.","Now is the most exciting time in fashion. Women are controlling their destiny now, the consumer is more knowledgeable, and I have to be better every single day.","We live in an era of globalization and the era of the woman. Never in the history of the world have women been more in control of their destiny.","I have this complex that if I walk into a place wearing a colorful shirt someone will stop me and say, 'I'm sorry, but the Latin band comes through the other door.'","The great thing about fashion is that it always looks forward.","I am not interested in shock tactics. I just want to make beautiful clothes.","I want to make clothes that people will wear, not styles that will make a big splash on the runway.","We're dealing with sophisticated customers. What's most important to these women is individuality. I have to create things she'll want to wear, no matter who she is.","If you want to establish an international presence you can't do so from New York. You need the consecration of Paris.","Every season I am inspired by women.","I do not have one theme for each season, I just try to make beautiful clothes all year round.","My customers are successful workingwomen.","Online media is increasingly influential in fashion.","Although I have no plans to tweet, I am fascinated by developments on the Internet.","I was surrounded by sisters. My childhood was all women.","Regardless of how good or bad a collection might be, it's a letdown after the show is over. It's done. Something you've worked on for months is just over."],"Oskar Kokoschka":["Intellectually, I am already an old man. But in the sensory area, I am still such a child! I shuffle on my bottom between the two.","All that's left now is purely poetic work, putting more life into individual places, as I've made so sure of the fundamental mood and dimension of expression that it won't leave me groping around in uncertainty any more.","There is no such thing as a German, French, or Anglo-American Expressionism! There are only young people trying to find their bearings in the world.","The mystery of the soul is like that of a closed door. When you open it, you see something which was not there before."],"Oskar Schindler":["If you saw a dog going to be crushed under a car, wouldn't you help him?","We must differentiate between guilt and duty. The soldier on the front, like the common man, who does his duty everywhere, should not be held responsible for the actions of a few who also called themselves Germans.","I was now resolved to do everything in my power to defeat the system.","Beyond this day, no thinking person could fail to see what would happen.","I thank my personal staff for their restless sacrifice for my work.","The Schindler Jews were off-limits in Brunnlitz."],"Oskar Werner":["I'm married to the theater but my mistress is the films.","I am married to the theater, and the films are only my mistress."],"Osman Baydemir":["All of my life I have stayed away from violence and the instruments of violence, and have seen a legal, democratic struggle as the only means to achieve change.","In primary school, every day and especially on Fridays, I was supposed to say, 'I am Turkish, and I am righteous and hardworking,' But all those things did not actually turn us into Turks. This system is somehow creating fake personalities.","I have had it up to here with the prosecutions, the government's attitude, the judiciary, the media's stance and the majority of Turks who view the Kurdish people's justified cause through a nationalist lens.","I am at a crossroads; I have always been against armed opposition... I have chosen civil disobedience. But I will apologize to my people if there are funerals coming out of prisons. I will criticize myself and I won't be the mayor of Diyarbakir.","In Turkey, we have lived almost everything that could be lived; war and torture... The war concept was consumed to its limits. But there is only one way we have not tried: negotiations, peace, and talking."],"Osman Rashid":["By 2025, we can expect the world to be completely digital. Paper books will be a thing of the past. Education will be delivered through analytics-based assessment tools and adaptive learning platforms.","Textbooks are going to remain a key part of learning. They just need to go digital, become more interactive and they need more analytics.","As things go digital, the notion of new editions will go away. A publisher can add video and assessment content at scale, make the change in 30 seconds and it's just a software update.","Parents are telling other parents that you can save a lot of money renting. Forever they've been looking for a solution to higher textbook prices.","Essentially, you have to be aware of a crisis happening: 'Can the company go on if I get hit by a bus?' That's, I think, how you build a great company and something that can scale.","For the price of a couple of Happy Meals, you can buy a digital textbook and stop your child from having to carry around a six-pound book.","I do not want to be a long-term CEO.","Using a service such as Chegg.com, students can save on average more than $600 a year when they rent textbooks over purchasing them.","Students today need experience to get a job, and they need a job to get experience. The Chegg Champion program provides students with a real-world working experience that actually offers financial rewards."],"Osric Chau":["When someone asks me to do something, something new, something I don't know about, and if I haven't done it, I'll say yes. Just so I can try something new. You never know what you might like.","I'm a huge gamer. I play a lot of games, and I play one game until I'm really, really good at it.","I wanted to be a stuntman. I didn't really want to be an actor. I took classes when I was younger, but I really sucked.","In high school I was president of the Student Council, and I ended up doing a lot of speeches. After you do a few in front of different schools, you get really comfortable talking in front of an audience.","Acting offers me an outlet. Here is the perfect opportunity to spend fleeting moments becoming an entirely different person; to experience a character entirely unlike myself, but to also make such a character a part of me. There is no routine here; there is no boredom.","How does one get bored of life?","I'm a homebody for sure. I do a lot of work at home.","I was born and raised in Vancouver. I moved to Beijing in 2010 just before the Olympics. Being an Asian Canadian actor, the amount of opportunity at the time was slim to none. I made the decision to go to China, and it was one of the best decisions of my life.","I do like alternative rock and rap, but as far as inspirational, then I go full-on orchestra. It fills up your entire being.","I try to do as much as I can, every facet of filmmaking."],"Ossie Davis":["Any form of art is a form of power; it has impact, it can affect change - it can not only move us, it makes us move.","I find, in being black, a thing of beauty: a joy; a strength; a secret cup of gladness.","Struggle is strengthening. Battling with evil gives us the power to battle evil even more.","College ain't so much where you been as how you talk when you get back."],"Oswald Chambers":["Holiness, not happiness, is the chief end of man.","Books are the blessed chloroform of the mind.","Faith is deliberate confidence in the character of God whose ways you may not understand at the time.","We have to pray with our eyes on God, not on the difficulties.","You will never cease to be the most amazed person on earth at what God has done for you on the inside.","When a man is at his wits' end it is not a cowardly thing to pray, it is the only way he can get in touch with Reality.","When it is a question of God's almighty Spirit, never say, 'I can't.'","The whole point of getting things done is knowing what to leave undone.","Character in a saint means the disposition of Jesus Christ persistently manifested.","If in preaching the gospel you substitute your knowledge of the way of salvation for confidence in the power of the gospel, you hinder people from getting to reality.","It is the unseen and the spiritual in people that determines the outward and the actual.","I have learnt that I am me, that I can do the things that, as one might put it, me can do, but I cannot do the things that me would like to do.","The dearest friend on earth is a mere shadow compared to Jesus Christ.","We look upon the enemy of our souls as a conquered foe, so he is, but only to God, not to us.","A good book, in the language of the book-sellers, is a salable one; in that of the curious, a scarce one; in that of men of sense, a useful and instructive one."],"Oswald Mosley":["There are periods in history when change is necessary, and other periods when it is better to keep everything for the time as it is. The art of life is to be in the rhythm of your age.","Anyone who knows how difficult it is to keep a secret among three men - particularly if they are married - knows how absurd is the idea of a worldwide secret conspiracy consciously controlling all mankind by its financial power; in real, clear analysis.","Great men of action... never mind on occasion being ridiculous; in a sense it is part of their job, and at times they all are.","A prophet or an achiever must never mind an occasional absurdity, it is an occupational risk."],"Oswald Spengler":["The secret of all victory lies in the organization of the non-obvious.","This is our purpose: to make as meaningful as possible this life that has been bestowed upon us; to live in such a way that we may be proud of ourselves; to act in such a way that some part of us lives on.","If few can stand a long war without deterioration of soul, none can stand a long peace.","There is no proletarian, not even a Communist movement, that has not operated in the interests of money, and for the time being permitted by money - and that without the idealists among its leaders having the slightest suspicion of the fact.","I maintain that many an inventor, many a diplomat, many a financier is a sounder philosopher than all those who practice the dull craft of experimental psychology.","Socialism is nothing but the capitalism of the lower classes."],"Otis Blackwell":["I used to be with a publishing house called Roosevelt Music. A gentleman there told me he had seen Peggy Lee perform Fever in Las Vegas and I found out later she wanted to record it.","When I was young, I just sat down and started playing Chopsticks at the piano. I got so far and then lost interest. Eventually, I regained it and started writing songs.","When I started writing it was kind of hard getting people to do my stuff. They' say they couldn't do my style.","I'd hate to be a songwriter starting a career today.","I always figured it was best if I write my songs, take them to my publisher and just lay back. There used to be so many things going on - getting to the artist, getting to the publishers - you know, politics. I just didn't want to get mixed up in all of that.","I used to go down every year for the remembrance of Elvis' birthday. Memphis State College invited me to sit in the auditorium and speak to the people for one of those Elvis days.","There have been many times when I've been asked to appear and I'd say to myself, what am I going to talk about? Early on, when I did interviews, I'd tell everyone, Don't ask me about dates. I don't even remember what I did yesterday.","I like this town, it's really great. They've put me in The Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame. This town is about music. It's about the kind of music I like.","I got behind that pencil and nothing happened for many years, but since they put me in the Songwriters Hall of Fame, I've turned around. I took a good look at myself and said, I think it's time to get back at work."],"Otis Redding":["If you want to be a singer, you've got to concentrate on it twenty-four hours a day. You can't be a well driller, too. You've got to concentrate on the business of entertaining and writing songs. Always think different from the next person. Don't ever do a song as you heard somebody else do it.","As I was growing up, I did a lot of talent shows. I won fifteen Sunday nights straight in a series of talent shows in Macon. I showed up the sixteenth night, and they wouldn't let me go on any more. Whatever success I had was through the help of the good Lord.","If I were to leave the U.S., I'd live in England. But I'd never leave the U.S. I own a 400-acre farm in Macon, Georgia. I raise cattle and hogs. I own horses, too. I love horses as much as singing. I like to hunt on horseback.","I love England from head to toe. I love the weather, the people. I was there in the summer and it was nice. The people are so groovy."],"Otis Rush":["I'll sit around and play my guitar; that's how I write tunes.","Them pains, when blues pains grab you, you'll sing the blues right.","Oh, I was working occasionally in and out of New York.","Nobody can tell you how the blues feel unless they have the blues. We all take it differently.","I was staying with my sister and messing around with the guitar every day for my own amusement. Then she took me around and introduced me to Muddy Waters, Jimmy Rogers, Little Walter, and the first time I saw that onstage, it inspired me to play. I thought that was the world.","I used to listen to country and western and blues, John Lee Hooker, spirituals, the Bluegrass Boys, and Eddie Arnold. There was a radio station that come on everyday with country, spirituals, and the blues.","I used to just sign papers and not pay no attention to what I'm signing.","I picked all the tunes before I went to Memphis, and the band was all set. Willie Mitchell is an arranger like I am, and he let me do what I had to do.","I didn't know Albert back then - I just learned to play that way. He and I were the only guys that played left-handed. Then left-handed people came from every direction.","A guy will promise you the world and give you nothin', and that's the blues."],"Otis Williams":["I've learned over the years that people are human and have mood swings, regardless of how talented they are. Today, I'm looking at life from a realistic point of view instead of the way I would want things to be.","Bill Mitchell said he really liked it. But when he asked the other four their opinions, we all took one look at ourselves in our raggedy long winter coats and cracked up. We knew we weren't likely to tempt anyone or anything, but what the hell, it was as good a name as any.","We've been performing with symphonies all of our career and it sounds so wonderful when they play 'My Girl' with the large string section, I want to turn around and look.","The Temptations still stand today, not in spite of those who left us, but because of them.","I'm the glue that holds everything together."],"Ottessa Moshfegh":["I've always known what I'm meant to do. The path of my life has been about discovering what I need to do to support myself as a writer.","It's insane that people have these Internet identities. It has very little to do with who we really are. As a writer, who I'm friends with, how I spend my time, what I look like, what I wear, what I eat, what kind of music I like - it's totally not important to the work.","I've always been interested in family secrets and what happens behind closed doors. I find that fascinating and creepy - that's why I read: because I want to know other people's secrets.","I don't care about being a literary personality - that doesn't appeal to me, especially because the literary world doesn't appeal to me. I actually don't feel like I even belong in it. If this was high school, I would be sitting with the Goths, looking at everyone, being like, 'Whatever.'","In my own experience, I've found that it's very difficult to make peace with women. We tend to be competitive and feel angry.","I'm a first - I was the first person in my family born in the United States. My mom is from Croatia, and my dad is from Iran. They met at music school in Belgium. I grew up as a pianist. I was really interested in piano and sort of discovered that I was a writer when I was about 13 and started writing.","I've always really enjoyed sharing my work with others. I find it really hard if I don't think the work will exist outside of my own apartment.","I've found that people get particularly frustrated and shut down when women in fiction are disgusting or disordered.","Puberty extends into your twenties, for sure, and some people don't get over that until much later in life. I feel like I'm just starting to get over puberty - basically twenty years of insufferable, totally self-obsessed hell.","My dad is a gentle and brilliant Iranian violinist.","Once I finished 'Eileen,' I wanted to write more novels. I don't see myself stopping any time soon."],"Ottmar Hitzfeld":["To represent a country, qualify for the World Cup, and get a team to perform at the right moment in time would be great honour for me.","We always go into a game to win.","I gain strength from postive thought and from the daily conversation with God.","As long as you are successful and winning matches, the language is no problem at all. But when the results are insufficient, the difficulties begin. At this time, a coach needs to go into more detail with his instructions, and that's where the problems can lie.","My coaching days are now over, and I'm proud of what I've achieved.","Guardiola focuses only on the tactics.","It's very likely that I will finish my career as Swiss national coach.","Every change in a team can turn into an opportunity for players to show themselves.","It's always important for a coach to decide on the short term and long term - one factor doesn't block out the other.","I am still hungry; I still hate defeats. There is no substitute for victories.","As long as there is a mathematical chance, we have to keep on going.","The favourites and the stronger teams have a lot of pressure during the group phase because everybody just takes it for granted that they will reach the round of 16.","There is always the fear of failure, and if you struggle, you become nervous, and that's when the underdogs have an opportunity to create a surprise.","I can live without football. There are more important things in life.","Sometimes, the supposedly weak groups turn out to be very difficult, and the supposedly strong ones are easier to take control of.","I have never broken a contract in my career.","I am proud of my career.","I have been very fortunate to coach marvellous teams, and it has been a great honour to work for Switzerland.","There is always pressure in football.","It cannot be a coincidence that a European team couldn't win a World Cup held in South America.","Xherdan Shaqiri is a player who can make the difference because he can decide games on his own.","Thomas Tuchel is a coach who can work in the long-term.","My philosophy is always to fulfill contracts.","When you get older, 10 matches a year are enough.","That you get booed belongs to professional sports.","We have to look after the health of the players. Quality suffers with too many games.","The job as a coach is difficult.","I did not think I would be able to do myself justice if I had to speak to the players in English. I would not be able to get my emotions and feelings across."],"Otto Bauer":["A nation is a totality of men united through community of fate into a community of character.","The dissolution of the Party - we will not let such a tremendous, big, and glorious party be so easily crashed: this would then be the moment, when we would begin to fight on all fronts."],"Otto Dix":["People were already beginning to forget, what horrible suffering the war had brought them. I did not want to cause fear and panic, but to let people know how dreadful war is and so to stimulate people's powers of resistance.","I had to experience how someone beside me suddenly falls over and is dead and the bullet has hit him squarely. I had to experience that quite directly. I wanted it. I'm therefore not a pacifist at all - or am I?","All art is exorcism. I paint dreams and visions too; the dreams and visions of my time. Painting is the effort to produce order; order in yourself. There is much chaos in me, much chaos in our time.","As a young man you don't notice at all that you were, after all, badly affected. For years afterwards, at least ten years, I kept getting these dreams, in which I had to crawl through ruined houses, along passages I could hardly get through.","I'm not that obsessed with making representations of ugliness. Everything I've seen is beautiful.","Not that painting would have been a release. The reason for doing it is the desire to create. I've got to do it! I've seen that, I can still remember it, I've got to paint it.","You know, if one paints someone's portrait, one should not know him if possible.","Everybody thinks they know what art should be. But very few of them have the sense that is necessary to experience painting, that is the sense of sight, that sees colors and forms as living reality in the picture.","I have to experience all the ghastly, bottomless depths for life for myself; it's for that reason that I went to war, and for that reason I volunteered.","I will either be famous or infamous."],"Otto Frank":["For me, it was a revelation. There, was revealed a completely different Anne to the child that I had lost. I had no idea of the depths of her thoughts and feelings.","I just can't think how I would go on without children having lost Edith already... It's too upsetting for me to write about them. Naturally, I still hope, and wait, wait, wait.","We all had lots of stories of our sad experiences - they mourned the death of my wife with me - but we were hopeful that the children would return."],"Otto Hahn":["I felt profoundly ashamed, I was very much upset.","First we attacked the Russian soldiers with our gases, and then when we saw the poor fellows lying there, dying slowly, we tried to make breathing easier for them by using our own life-saving devices on them.","At first the English were very surprised by our disregarding the Hague Convention. But from 1916 onward they used at least as much poison as we did.","I knew that the Hague Convention prohibited the use of poison in war. I didn't know the details of the terms of the Convention, but I did know of that prohibition."],"Otto Heinrich Warburg":["The toxic effect of carbon monoxide on man has nothing to do with inhibition of cellular respiration by carbon monoxide but is based on the reaction of carbon monoxide with blood iron.","The concentration of the ferment iron in living substance is very small, being in the region of 1 g to 10 million g of cellular substance.","Green, red, and mixed shades of haemins are known. If magnesium is replaced by iron in chlorophyll, green haemins are obtained. Their colour is due to a strong band in the red which is already recognized in chlorophyll.","Catalytic oxidation in living substances rests upon change of valency in an iron compound which is the respiratory oxygen-transferring ferment."],"Otto Hermann Kahn":["The deadliest foe of democracy is not autocracy but liberty frenzied.","As so often before, liberty has been wounded in the house of its friends.","The appeal all too often is to the gallery, hungry for sensation."],"Otto Lilienthal":["To invent an airplane is nothing. To build one is something. But to fly is everything."],"Otto Loewi":["In nerve-free multicellular organisms, the relationships of the cells to each other can only be of a chemical nature. In multicellular organisms with nerve systems, the nerve cells only represent cells like any others, but they have extensions suited to the purpose which they serve, namely the nerves.","Natural or artificial stimulation of nerves gives rise to a process of progressive excitation in them, leading to a response in the effector organ of the nerves concerned."],"Otto Penzler":["A lot of locked-room mysteries take time for you to pay attention and see the setup. They aren't thrillers, and they don't move along. The modern mystery story is really faster-paced, and I think modern readers tend to prefer seeing something happening on every other page.","A pulp story without a detective and, obviously, somebody for him to do battle with is unthinkable, and I can't remember reading a pulp story that didn't have a dame - either a good girl or a bad girl.","Mysteries include so many things: the noir novel, espionage novel, private eye novels, thrillers, police procedurals. But the pure detective story is where there's a detective and a criminal who's committed a murder and leaves clues for the detective and the careful reader to find.","Big cities do evoke a sense of menace.","All cultures have had a belief in ghosts and a fear of ghosts. People have always told stories, and everybody likes being frightened, especially when you feel safe. Personally, I find them scarier than vampires or zombies.","I have always been a pretty big fan of ghost stories.","Today's ghost stories tend to be much more physically or psychologically violent. The Victorians were much more leisurely about what might or could happen, building suspense layer by layer rather than punching you in the face.","I don't believe in ghosts and have never seen one. I wish I could see one, and I would like to have seen one because then I could believe in God. If I can see it, feel it and taste it, then I believe in it.","One of the hopes we have when we hear or read an interview with a mystery writer is to get inside the writer's head, to learn something we didn't know before.","It was really in the Golden Age, between the two world wars, when the pure detective story - of which the locked room mystery is really the ultimate form - became popular.","To this day, I've never figured out a single locked-room mystery."],"Otto Preminger":["What counts isn't the frame, it's what you put in it.","I can't talk about every single film I made. It's not my way to go back into the past and to look at my old pictures and to discuss them.","Directing her was like directing Lassie. You need 14 takes to get each one of them right.","When I was a young actor in Vienna, already my hair was falling out at a rapid rate. I went to a doctor, who said hair was like grass: if you mow it, then it grows back stronger. So I went to Brittany, where nobody knew me, and I shaved my head. When it grew back - only the fringes!","When I finish a film, I want to forget it. I never like to repeat myself. Maybe, when I am dead, they will find certain consistencies in the style of my films, but I never want one film to look like another.","I live in the present. When I finish a film, it is behind me. My reward is in my work, not in a lot of old memories.","I stopped acting when I was 19. The only time I acted again was during the war, when there were no other Nazis available.","Directing Marilyn Monroe was like directing Lassie. You needed fourteen takes to get each one of them right.","I do not welcome advice from actors; they are here to act.","I never seek controversy or foresee it for my pictures. I take a personal stand, and perhaps because my films are on contemporary subjects, people do not share my point of view."],"Otto Rank":["Art is life's dream interpretation.","The new meaning of soul is creativity and mysticism. These will become the foundation of the new psychological type and with him or her will come the new civilization.","The correct didactic analysis is one that does not in the least differ from the curative treatment. How, indeed, shall the future analyst learn the technique if he does not experience it just exactly as he is to apply it later?","Thou shalt not give birth reluctantly.","Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife, for there are plenty of others."],"Otto Schily":["We feel very honored to have been offered the responsibility to host this great event, Berlin is a wonderful city that is developing at a tremendous rate, and this decision means that we can now prepare to welcome the world's best athletes to a fascinating place.","It's a mistake to assume that Islamists always come from the slums. Indeed, many come from affluent families but for some reason just couldn't manage to integrate into Western society, even though they had good opportunities for advancement.","Arresting and detaining these dangerous people can make sense, at least until a final decision is reached on their deportation. However, such detention must always be subject to time limits and court review.","On September 11 last year international terrorism entered a new dimension.","The hatred Muslim extremists feel against the West feeds on certain conflicts in the world.","We have points in common with the FDP, particularly when it comes to tax.","Who knows what would have become of me, if my parents had not had their influence on me.","After Madrid, we intensified our investigative efforts once again, and we are in the process of bringing about expansions in security laws and creating an index file system.","It is a warning to all those who may think about becoming involved with a terrorist network, people who are willing to destroy their own lives are hard to deter.","The attacks on the Paris Metro in the 1990s were committed by members of the local Muslim community, immigrants from the Maghreb region of North Africa.","The military has been tremendously important in the past during catastrophes and in protecting the population. But it shouldn't become an auxiliary police force.","The vast majority of Muslims living here are peaceful citizens. Unfortunately, however, we also see religious and political fanaticism among Muslim groups in Germany.","There is no question that Iraq is one of the main problems. You'd have to be blind not to see what a magnet and generating force it's become for terrorist groups.","This fanaticism is what feeds terrorism. And this is precisely why Muslims must play an active role in opposing hate sermons and incitement to terrorism and extremism in their mosques.","And now when we hear that Iran and Iraq plan to cooperate more closely and that a fundamentalist is coming to power in Tehran - a man about whom we cannot be sure that he is absolutely averse to terrorism - it is very worrisome.","Freedom of the press is not questioned when investigative journalism unearths scandals, But that does not mean that every classified state document should be made available to journalists.","Incidentally, our railroad facilities are under video surveillance by the federal police. However, the federal and state governments will have to determine whether video surveillance shouldn't be significantly expanded to a certain degree.","Nevertheless, I do know that we are part of a danger zone, we have military operations in Afghanistan and we're training the Iraqi police force. The terrorists also have us in their sights.","On the other hand, all kinds of adventurous schemes to add security checkpoints to subway and bus systems have been circulating since the London attacks. This is nonsense. No one can guaranty 100 percent security.","Procedures outside the stadiums and in the parking areas still need to be optimized, for example so that emergency medical services can leave the grounds on their way to the hospital faster.","The terrorists who committed the 2003 Istanbul attacks were locals, that is, Turks. And when filmmaker Theo van Gogh was murdered in the Netherlands last year, the murderer and his supporters were also part of the Muslim community.","This will help us next year with the World Cup. I can imagine a lot of visitors from abroad will be here and asking what happened between 1933 and 1945. A lot of that will come up. I think this will make an important contribution to those discussions.","We can no longer apply the classic criteria to clearly determine whether and when we should use military force. We are waging war in Afghanistan, for example, but it's an asymmetrical war where the enemies are criminals instead of soldiers."],"Otto Wallach":["As soon as we can wrest from Nature the secret of the internal structure of the compounds produced by her, chemical science can then even surpass Nature by producing compounds as variations of the natural ones, which the living cell is unable to construct.","It has been possible to trace historically back to a very early age the taxes which were imposed on medicines, spices and similar substances in German towns. Thus, for instance, one finds that in the year 1500, thirteen, in 1540, thirty-eight, and in 1708, already one hundred and twenty vegetable oils are mentioned.","In bitter almond oil, like in a great number of other substances that previously had been counted among the 'aromatic compounds' on behalf of their strong smell, a derivative of benzene is present. The special properties of benzene and its derivatives are caused by the typical arrangement of their carbon atoms.","In organic chemistry, we have learnt to derive from compounds containing only carbon and hydrogen, i.e. from the hydrocarbons, all other types of combinations, such as alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, acids, etc.","As soon as chemists have a definite conception of the internal structure of the molecule of an organic compound, they are able to tackle the task of producing these substances by artificial methods, i.e. by synthesis, as we call it.","Most of the oils which are valued as scents are mixtures of substances; only the combined effect of these leads to the known result.","As soon as science has solved one problem, new ones arise. This is the essence of science, and it applies, of course, also to the field of essential oils.","One would think that plants belonging to the same genus would always produce identical or at least similar oils. But this is by no means so.","May the work for the further development of chemical science, which has its strongest roots in this beautiful, strong and hard-working country of Sweden, continue to flourish in the future, for the promotion of culture and the benefit of mankind."],"Otto Weininger":["Among the notable things about fire is that it also requires oxygen to burn - exactly like its enemy, life. Thereby are life and flames so often compared.","Fate determines many things, no matter how we struggle.","No men who really think deeply about women retain a high opinion of them; men either despise women or they have never thought seriously about them.","All genius is a conquering of chaos and mystery.","The fixed stars signify the angel in man. That is why man orients himself by them; and that is why women have no appreciation for the starry sky; because they have no sense of the angel in man.","Every true, eternal problem is an equally true, eternal fault; every answer an atonement, every realisation an improvement.","The genius which runs to madness is no longer genius."],"Otto von Bismarck":["Anyone who has ever looked into the glazed eyes of a soldier dying on the battlefield will think hard before starting a war.","People never lie so much as after a hunt, during a war or before an election.","The secret of politics?

It must not look to the left or right but go forward.","Be polite; write diplomatically; even in a declaration of war one observes the rules of politeness.","When you say you agree to a thing in principle you mean that you have not the slightest intention of carrying it out in practice.","To retain respect for sausages and laws, one must not watch them in the making.","An appeal to fear never finds an echo in German hearts.","Whoever speaks of Europe is wrong: it is a geographical expression.","Politics ruins the character.","Politics is the art of the next best.","Politics is not an exact science."],"Ouida":["Could we see when and where we are to meet again, we would be more tender when we bid our friends goodbye.","Take hope from the heart of man and you make him a beast of prey.","Familiarity is a magician that is cruel to beauty but kind to ugliness.","Petty laws breed great crimes.","To vice, innocence must always seem only a superior kind of chicanery.","Christianity has made of death a terror which was unknown to the gay calmness of the Pagan.","A cruel story runs on wheels, and every hand oils the wheels as they run.","An easy-going husband is the one indispensable comfort of life.","It is hard work to be good when you are very little and very hungry, and have many sticks to beat you, and no mother's lips to kiss you."],"Ovadia Yosef":["There was a tsunami and there are terrible natural disasters, all of this because of too little Torah study.","Where there is Torah it sustains the world.","We should have a banquet on the day haters die.","You must not lean on a tree on Sabbath, if the tree might be dependent on you for support.","Saving a life overrides territories."],"Oveta Culp Hobby":["Everything that ever happened to me fell in my lap.","Twenty is a wonderful age for things to be sparked."],"Ovid":["Love and dignity cannot share the same abode.","The sharp thorn often produces delicate roses.","Time is generally the best doctor.","Fortune and love favor the brave.","In our leisure we reveal what kind of people we are.","Nowadays nothing but money counts: a fortune brings honors, friendships; the poor man everywhere lies low.","The spirited horse, which will try to win the race of its own accord, will run even faster if encouraged.","Let your hook be always cast.

Why don't you just clothesline the guy?","Why do you need to do a fancy cartwheel for before you hit him? It just looks stupid.","A guy like Benoit, he's really good and a lot like Dynamite. Dynamite, just because he was the original, was the best. But, you know, Benoit now is by far better. Dynamite Kid is nothing now.","They said they wanted a lot of feathers, glitter, colourful colours. A costume. So I had a lady here in Calgary make it. She just kind of put together what I had in mind.","All I had to do was go out and perform. One of the hardest things was doing those back flips, where you had to jump up and land on the top rope. It's precision movement.","Not only was it that I surprised people by beating Bret Hart, but it was a great match. They still rate it as one of the best wrestling matches of all time.","I owe a lot to my dad, just for having provided the wrestling business for us to get into.","If Bret went in there and stunk the place out, then they probably wouldn't have brought the little brother in. So just by being successful himself, it opened the door for me.","There's so many documentaries out there right now and everything's exposing wrestling.","It's kind of beating a dead horse if you're talking about going out and saying wrestling's fake, or this or that. People don't want to hear that. They want to hear, they wanted to find an inside story.","There was a bit of a comparison that Bret was making between Vince McMahon and my dad. He looked up to Vince as a dad and stuff, and it was a shame to see the whole thing end the way it did.","I certainly would have regretted not getting into wrestling. It's been very lucrative for me and I've been fortunate to get into it and make money and not do anything stupid where I invested in something that collapsed.","You get on TV and you become more of a star and it makes it real hard to go back to school and sit in a classroom, put your hand up if you have a question or something.","It's unacceptable to just sit on the couch and say I'm not doing anything. You've got to get out and do everything you can.","It's hard to pick out one particular wrestler.","I think by the time I was born, my parents had pretty well run the gauntlet with their kids. The novelty had kind of worn off by the time the twelfth child was born. I was lucky to get fed and changed, picked up and taken to school.","The perks of working in Japan are that you might go for two weeks every three or four months, so you do work an abbreviated schedule. But you really make up for the abbreviated schedule by how hard you have to fight, how much you've got to be in shape.","I find too often in the wrestling business, you just wrestle, get to the hotel, make your money. Sometimes I have to stop and remind myself to enjoy my life and not just rush through.","I had a very bad torn groin, my abdomen right through my legs. I was finding it really hard to get in the ring and run around and function at a decent rate. Then they had the idea that it might be better to do a retirement thing.","Nobody really knows for sure who the Blue Blazer is, but like I said in my interview, there's a little bit of the Blue Blazer in each and every one of us.","Double J is similar in age, we're similar in experience. I think if we hooked up, we could be a formidable team. We get along well inside the ring and outside the ring.","I love working in Canada. The ovation is great. It makes me feel like I'm the top dog."],"Owen King":["Steve Buscemi is the little black dress of cinema, appropriate for any occasion.","I was pretty naive about how hard it would be to get out from under the family name. Not that I'm complaining.","Stephen King's 'Mr. Mercedes' is not a conventional horror novel. No ghosts, no vampires, no prune-faced escapees of the graveyard.","For me, the easiest thing to figure out is the story I want to tell, and the hardest thing is to figure out the voice that's gonna tell it. And that's why I finish very little.","I grew up watching Cinemax, the late-night Cinemax of the '80s and early '90s.","Just because it's physically impossible for Steve Buscemi to be in every movie doesn't mean he's not capable of dramatically improving them all.","Although it's depressing to admit this, more than a handful of post-'Donnie Brasco' Al Pacino roles would have been better served by Steve Buscemi.","One corollary of the wretchedness of the second trilogy of 'Star Wars' films has been the final, demented sanctification of the first trilogy of films.","I'd love to be able to draw or play guitar or dance. All three at the same time - that's the talent for me.","My first job was as a groundskeeper at the local ballpark in the town where I grew up. There was a lot of down time, and I got to drive tractor, so it was pretty good gig. I've also taught creative writing, dabbled in reviewing and journalism, and toiled as a screenwriter.","I suspect that perfect happiness is not possible for me. I suppose if I was ever selected for eternal life - the moment I was informed - that would bring me the closest.","My personal history is strewn with massive errors in judgment. They're all precious to me.","The last thing I want to do is to present something as 'Stephen King, Part II,' and have it be something that's a big disappointment.","I wasn't good at the sciences; I wasn't a good enough athlete. The only thing I could do was mow lawns. So I thought that writing or teaching was what I wanted to do.","I'm a very liberal person.","I didn't want to write a book as Stephen King's son, because all I did was get born, and that's not much of an accomplishment. If that was the reason my book was published, it wouldn't be worth the paper it was printed on. I wanted to do my own thing.","I could write about coal miners in Northern Pennsylvania, and people would ask if I was writing about my dad.","I think the model that I look at is someone like Jakob Dylan, whose dad is obviously every bit if not more famous than mine. He's a guy who sought to build a career on his own, doing something that's a little bit different than what his father does.","I didn't really get serious about my own writing until I was convinced it was something that I wanted to do, that I wanted to spend that much time alone.","I went to public schools in Bangor, Maine, and had as normal a childhood as you could imagine someone could, living in an enormous red house and being the son of a millionaire best-selling writer. I mean, I actually had a strangely normal childhood despite all that.","The questions about my father are inevitable, regardless of the characters I create or the subject matter.","It's not easy for me as a writer to suspend my disbelief in a fantastical zone. I can do it. But it's more natural for me to write stories that are comic. Or hopefully comic.","My father has been a major force in the popular culture for a long, long time. He's a fascinating person.","Everyday life is pretty funny and pretty ridiculous and occasionally really great, though not all the time, and that's all part of it.","My parents and my brother root for me.","I do try to entertain.","When I was a kid, we used to play this thing called 'the writing game' with our father. My brother and I would play it - where first person writes a sentence, and the second person writes a sentence, and the third person writes a sentence, and so on until you get bored and have to go to bed.","Comic books and films have a lot more in common than, say, comics and books or films and books. The two art forms, to me, seem like pretty close siblings.","I like some of the B movies that are intentionally funny.","I like 'Reanimator,' and I like 'Evil Dead 2.' But I really like the Corman movies from the late '60s and early '70s, and my favorite is 'The Mask of Red Death' with Vincent Price because - spoiler alert - but at the end of the movie, Vincent Price, he's the evil prince, and to kill him, his court just, like, dances at him.","I only finish probably one out of every ten things I start. I give up all the time.","The stock market is for people who live in Manhattan and summer in the Hamptons, for people who can afford fancy cars - a Mercedes, say.","Who wouldn't be depressed living in a society that can't agree on reality, let alone health-care policy?","I find that I'm extremely unattracted to anything that's humorless. There is writing that is entirely serious, and it doesn't ring true to me, because I think, oftentimes, life is very, very funny. Even the worst, most humiliating, savage disappointments in retrospect have elements of bleak humor.","A lot of storytelling... you're a bit hypnotized by it, and things just come out in certain ways, and you look at it and try to gather it.","I give my work to my wife first to read. Then, I try to find new people who haven't read my work before, to get a new perspective.","It's hard for me to teach and write my own work at the same time.","I think I always wanna write comedy because that's what feels truest to me; it feels closest to life as I know it, so that's what I want to reproduce.","I think it's almost impossible to edit something to death. I think you can make things better almost indefinitely."],"Owen Paterson":["I was perhaps about 10 years old when a local farmer rang us up to say he had found a young badger and would we take it in. So we did; it was a female called Bessy and she lived in the boiler room. She was extremely intelligent, had a very low opinion of cats but loved the dogs. She was pretty well trained; she went in the car.","Climate change is obviously happening and there is obviously a man-made contribution.","The relationship between renewable energy sources and the communities we expect to host them must be appropriate and sustainable and, above all, acceptable to local people.","No one is more keen than me to see the Hunting Act repealed, because I believe in the management of wildlife.","Government can wreck a business by confiscating its money by taxation.","One thing I have been banging on about, we have a dessert deficit in the U.K. We still import a very large proportion of our desserts. I would ask everyone to go out and buy a British dessert.","We have to use every tool at our disposal and that's why we're trialing a badger cull. We need healthy wildlife living alongside healthy cattle. Only if we work to eradicate the reservoir of TB in our badgers, will we have the strong and prosperous dairy industry the public wishes to see."],"Owen Wilson":["You can think of Hollywood as high school. TV actors are freshmen, comedy actors are maybe juniors, and dramatic actors - they're the cool seniors.","It's funny how it usually works out that I end up dying. It sort of works out, because by the time I die, I'm usually tired of working on that particular movie, so I look forward to it.","I have never taken myself that seriously as an actor.","I definitely would like to do some more dramatic roles.","I think the way it works is that when you're casting a movie, you usually want to work with people that you believe in.","Movies I liked growing up were like Francis Ford Coppolla movies and Scorsese movies."],"Owen Wister":["When yu' can't have what you choose, yu' just choose what you have.","When you can't have what you choose, you just choose what you have."],"Oxana Chusovitina":["The kids are so much fun. I'm always taking a look over at what they're doing because it reminds me of when I was so small before.","I'll take a look and get a second wind because so many little children are running around at my side.","I feel about 18, but my mind is much more mature now, so it's a perfect combination.","I don't know how to thank everyone for all their help.","I could go to London in 2012. I will only be 37.","There was no child oncology in Uzbekistan and in Russia you don't have a chance because there are already so many on the waiting lists."],"Ozwald Boateng":["Film has always been a really good tool for me to communicate emotion about why I create a collection. I'm probably one of the first designers to make short films.","If I'm going to do something, I'm going to do it well. That's just my character, that's just the way it is with me.","I had a suit made for me when I was five. It was double-breasted, mohair and purple. My mother was very particular about clothing - it always used to have to go back into the plastic and it used to drive me insane.","Film is such a very good tool for communicating emotions, and all designers and creative people look to inspire an emotional response.","If you're a designer, there's got to be some films that you've seen that have inspired you creatively. There's no escaping that.","Anyone can wear any color. The question is about finding the right shade. There is a momentary trend to dark colors because when the financials are not that great, people go for black, navy and grey.","Shirt collars are very important to me. Putting a very soft shirt collar with a formal suit doesn't work for me at all.","I haven't been to a job interview since I was 16 years old. When I was approached by Givenchy it was more like a courtship.","When I started, department stores were either very fashion, or very tailored, so the two never mixed. I mixed it, and they said you're too tailored for fashion and too fashion for tailoring. So I had to move the market. So that's what I did.","When things happen - you ask yourself why today, why not tomorrow, why not yesterday? That's the most amazing thing about time.","Tailoring was considered to be a world that was very traditional, and basically going out of fashion. Fashion designers did not have a real link with tailoring or tradition, so I fused the two worlds together.","I'm not into street clothes. Don't understand it. I don't understand those over-exaggerated jean sizes so they hang off your back... I just don't understand it.","You come to me and it's my job to make you look the best you can look. From an image point of view, would I prefer to dress Jude Law instead of Rolf Harris? Of course. But it's my job to make them both look great.","I have my fashion empire to build.","I'm doing a lot of things in Africa. I've formed a company with two friends of mine called Made In Africa and we are doing a lot of important things across the continent.","In Los Angeles, I'm always in Fred Segal. It's become a ritual. I have lunch and then buy lots of things I don't need. Usually tons of clothes for the kids that they grow out of in 10 seconds.","Because I'm a designer, I'm quite good when I shop. I know what I'm looking for.","My wife and I have a tradition of popcorn and videos with our kids on Friday evenings.","I love Coco de Mer.","I'm ready to do womenswear. You've always got to be inspired by something new - women have so much more shape and I'm about finding what to engineer around those shapes."],"Ozzie Smith":["I don't think anybody ever really just retires where they don't do anything.","We hope there is a sense of purpose in everything.","My short game's not that good. It just becomes a matter of getting that weight moving.","We saw very little of the real Jack Buck behind the microphone. He would touch people in ways that we will never know. Jack was much more than just an announcer.","I don't know how many people have ever seen the National Guard break in somewhere, but they mean business."],"Ozzy Osbourne":["Of all the things I've lost I miss my mind the most.","I couldn't be a royal. It's like living in a supersonic goldfish bowl.","To be a liar, you've got to have a great memory, and I don't have a memory.","All that stuff about heavy metal and hard rock, I don't subscribe to any of that. It's all just music. I mean, the heavy metal from the Seventies sounds nothing like the stuff from the Eighties, and that sounds nothing like the stuff from the Nineties. Who's to say what is and isn't a certain type of music?","It's all part of my journey - I've done a lot of stupid things, but you learn by your mistakes.","You gotta be really careful what you bite off. Don't bite off more than you can chew. It's a dangerous world.","Somebody said to me this morning, 'To what do you attribute your longevity?' I don't know. I mean, I couldn't have planned my life out better. By all accounts I should be dead! The abuse I put my body through: the drugs, the alcohol, the lifestyle I've lived the last 30 years!","Whenever I have a bad day I just think of these people.","When you're young, you're stupid. You do silly things.","I got rabies shots for biting the head off a bat but that's OK - the bat had to get Ozzy shots.","I have a saying. 'Never judge a book by its cover'. I say that because I don't even know who Ozzy is. I wake up a new person every day.","I'll only retire in the day I should be dead and they have me buried, and some idiot spell over my casket some stupid gospel stuff.","MTV made a huge impact. Heavy rotation took you from selling 1m albums to 20m albums, and that meant a lot of dough.","Being sober on a bus is, like, totally different than being drunk on a bus.","Rock music is not meant to be perfect.","I used to fantasize that Paul McCartney would marry my sister.","I have a genuine love affair with my audience. When I'm on stage they're not privileged to see me. It's a privilege for me to see them.","They say military have the so-called 'secret intelligence' - this amount of intelligence must be very secret, since I've never seen any intelligent military person, nor I have seen any sense in the bloody stupid wars.","I'm about caring, I'm about people, and I'm about entertaining people. I'm a family man. A husband. A father. I've been a lot of other things over the years, which we don't really want to talk about.","I'm dyslexic, I have attention-deficit disorder, and I've got something like a hereditary tremor.","I wish I didn't have to perform 'Iron Man' every night.","I can't do anything in moderation.","What is the world coming to?","I'm a very simple man. You've got to have, like, a computer nowadays to turn the TV on and off... and the nightmare continues.","I am a raging alcoholic and a raging addict and I didn't want to see my kids do the same thing.","I cannot turn down this incredible honor twice.","What is this? It's music to get a brain seizure by.","I knew it was time to get off of reality TV when someone asked me if I sang as well as acted.","L.A.'s not a good place to grow old."]}
